                "(Heb. Hebhel), a breath, or vanity, the second son of Adam and Eve. He was put to death by his brother Cain ([Gen. 4:1-16](/gen#Gen.4.1)). Guided by the instruction of their father, the two brothers were trained in the duty of worshipping God. \u201cAnd in process of time\u201d (marg. \u201cat the end of days\u201d, i.e., on the Sabbath) each of them offered up to God of the first-fruits of his labours. Cain, as a husbandman, offered the fruits of the field; Abel, as a shepherd, of the firstlings of his flock. \u201cThe Lord had respect unto Abel and his offering; but unto Cain and his offering he had not respect\u201d ([Gen. 4:3-5](/gen#Gen.4.3)). On this account Cain was angry with his brother, and formed the design of putting him to death; a design which he at length found an opportunity of carrying into effect ([Gen. 4:8](/gen#Gen.4.8), [9](/gen#Gen.4.9). Comp. [1 John 3:12](/1john#1John.3.12)). There are several references to Abel in the New Testament. Our Saviour speaks of him as \u201crighteous\u201d ([Matt. 23:35](/matt#Matt.23.35)). \u201cThe blood of sprinkling\u201d is said to speak \u201cbetter things than that of Abel\u201d ([Heb. 12:24](/heb#Heb.12.24)); i.e., the blood of Jesus is the reality of which the blood of the offering made by Abel was only the type. The comparison here is between the sacrifice offered by Christ and that offered by Abel, and not between the blood of Christ calling for mercy and the blood of the murdered Abel calling for vengeance, as has sometimes been supposed. It is also said ([Heb. 11:4](/heb#Heb.11.4)) that \u201cAbel offered unto God a more excellent sacrifice than Cain.\u201d This sacrifice was made \u201cby faith;\u201d this faith rested in God, not only as the Creator and the God of providence, but especially in God as the great Redeemer, whose sacrifice was typified by the sacrifices which, no doubt by the divine institution, were offered from the days of Adam downward. On account of that \u201cfaith\u201d which looked forward to the great atoning sacrifice, Abel\u2019s offering was accepted of God. Cain\u2019s offering had no such reference, and therefore was rejected. Abel was the first martyr, as he was the first of our race to die.\n\n Abel (Heb. \u2018abhel), lamentation ([1 Sam. 6:18](/1sam#1Sam.6.18)), the name given to the great stone in Joshua\u2019s field whereon the ark was \u201cset down.\u201d The Revised Version, however, following the Targum and the LXX., reads in the Hebrew text \u2019ebhen (= a stone), and accordingly translates \u201cunto the great stone, whereon they set down the ark.\u201d This reading is to be preferred.\n\n Abel (Heb. \u2018abhel), a grassy place, a meadow. This word enters into the composition of the following words:"

                "The high land or mountains, a city in the land of Shinar. It has been identified with the mounds of Akker Kuf, some 50 miles to the north of Babylon; but this is doubtful. It was one of the cities of Nimrod\u2019s kingdom ([Ge 10:10](/gen#Gen.10.10)). It stood close to the Euphrates, opposite Sippara.\n\n It is also the name of the country of which this city was the capital, namely, northern or upper Babylonia. The Accadians who came from the \u201cmountains of the east,\u201d where the ark rested, attained to a high degree of civilization. In the Babylonian inscriptions they are called \u201cthe black heads\u201d and \u201cthe black faces,\u201d in contrast to \u201cthe white race\u201d of Semitic descent. They invented the form of writing in pictorial hieroglyphics, and also the cuneiform system, in which they wrote many books partly on papyrus and partly on clay. The Semitic Babylonians (\u201cthe white race\u201d), or, as some scholars think, first the Cushites, and afterwards, as a second immigration, the Semites, invaded and conquered this country; and then the Accadian language ceased to be a spoken language, although for the sake of its literary treasures it continued to be studied by the educated classes of Babylonia. A large portion of the Ninevite tablets brought to light by Oriental research consists of interlinear or parallel translations from Accadian into Assyrian; and thus that long-forgotten language has been recovered by scholars. It belongs to the class of languages called agglutinative, common to the Tauranian race; i.e., it consists of words \u201cglued together,\u201d without declension of conjugation. These tablets in a remarkable manner illustrate ancient history. Among other notable records, they contain an account of the Creation which closely resembles that given in the book of Genesis, of the Sabbath as a day of rest, and of the Deluge and its cause."

                "The name originally of a narrow strip of territory in Greece, on the north-west of the Peloponnesus. Subsequently it was applied by the Romans to the whole Peloponnesus, now called the Morea, and the south of Greece. It was then one of the two provinces (Macedonia being the other) into which they divided the country when it fell under their dominion. It is in this latter enlarged meaning that the name is always used in the New Testament ([Acts 18:12](/acts#Acts.18.12), [27](/acts#Acts.18.27); [19:21](/acts#Acts.19.21); [Rom. 15](/rom#Rom.15): 26; 16:5, etc.). It was at the time when Luke wrote the Acts of the Apostles under the proconsular form of government; hence the appropriate title given to Gallio as the \u201cdeputy,\u201d i.e., proconsul, of Achaia ([Acts 18:12](/acts#Acts.18.12))."

They were not the descendants of Amalek, the son of Eliphaz, for they existed in the days of Abraham ([Gen. 14:7](/gen#Gen.14.7)). They were probably a tribe that migrated from the shores of the Persian Gulf and settled in Arabia. \u201cThey dwelt in the land of the south...from Havilah until thou comest to Shur\u201d ([Num. 13:29](/num#Num.13.29); [1 Sam. 15:7](/1sam#1Sam.15.7)). They were a pastoral, and hence a nomadic race. Their kings bore the hereditary name of Agag ([Num. 24:7](/num#Num.24.7); [1 Sam. 15:8](/1sam#1Sam.15.8)). They attempted to stop the Israelites when they marched through their territory ([Deut. 25:18](/deut#Deut.25.18)), attacking them at Rephidim ([Ex. 17:8-13](/exod#Exod.17.8); comp. [Deut. 25:17](/deut#Deut.25.17); [1 Sam. 15:2](/1sam#1Sam.15.2)). They afterwards attacked the Israelites at Hormah ([Num. 14:45](/num#Num.14.45)). We read of them subsequently as in league with the Moabites ([Judg. 3:13](/judg#Judg.3.13)) and the Midianites ([Judg. 6:3](/judg#Judg.6.3)). Saul finally desolated their territory and destroyed their power ([1 Sam. 14:48](/1sam#1Sam.14.48); [15:3](/1sam#1Sam.15.3)), and David recovered booty from them ([1 Sam. 30:18-20](/1sam#1Sam.30.18)). In the Babylonian inscriptions they are called Sute, in those of Egypt Sittiu, and the Amarna tablets include them under the general name of Khabbati, or \u201cplunderers.\u201d"

                "The usual name of the descendants of Ammon, the son of Lot ([Gen. 19:38](/gen#Gen.19.38)). From the very beginning ([Deut. 2:16-20](/deut#Deut.2.16)) of their history till they are lost sight of ([Judg. 5:2](/judg#Judg.5.2)), this tribe is closely associated with the Moabites ([Judg. 10:11](/judg#Judg.10.11); [2 Chr. 20:1](/2chr#2Chr.20.1); [Zeph. 2:8](/zeph#Zeph.2.8)). Both of these tribes hired Balaam to curse Israel ([Deut. 23:4](/deut#Deut.23.4)). The Ammonites were probably more of a predatory tribe, moving from place to place, while the Moabites were more settled. They inhabited the country east of the Jordan and north of Moab and the Dead Sea, from which they had expelled the Zamzummims or Zuzims ([Deut. 2:20](/deut#Deut.2.20); [Gen. 14:5](/gen#Gen.14.5)). They are known as the Beni-ammi ([Gen. 19:38](/gen#Gen.19.38)), Ammi or Ammon being worshipped as their chief god. They were of Semitic origin, and closely related to the Hebrews in blood and language. They showed no kindness to the Israelites when passing through their territory, and therefore they were prohibited from \u201centering the congregation of the Lord to the tenth generation\u201d ([Deut. 23:3](/deut#Deut.23.3)). They afterwards became hostile to Israel ([Judg. 3:13](/judg#Judg.3.13)). Jephthah waged war against them, and \u201ctook twenty cities with a very great slaughter\u201d ([Judg. 11:33](/judg#Judg.11.33)). They were again signally defeated by Saul ([1 Sam. 11:11](/1sam#1Sam.11.11)). David also defeated them and their allies the Syrians ([2 Sam. 10:6-14](/2sam#2Sam.10.6)), and took their chief city, Rabbah, with much spoil ([2 Sam. 10:14](/2sam#2Sam.10.14); [12:26-31](/2sam#2Sam.12.26)). The subsequent events of their history are noted in [2 Chr. 20:25](/2chr#2Chr.20.25); [26:8](/2chr#2Chr.26.8); [Jer. 49:1](/jer#Jer.49.1); [Ezek. 25:3](/ezek#Ezek.25.3), [6](/ezek#Ezek.25.6). One of Solomon\u2019s wives was Naamah, an Ammonite. She was the mother of Rehoboam ([1 Kings 14:31](/1kgs#1Kgs.14.31); [2 Chr. 12:13](/2chr#2Chr.12.13)).\n\n The prophets predicted fearful judgments against the Ammonites because of their hostility to Israel ([Zeph. 2:8](/zeph#Zeph.2.8); [Jer. 49:1-6](/jer#Jer.49.1); [Ezek. 25:1-5](/ezek#Ezek.25.1), [10](/ezek#Ezek.25.10); [Amos 1:13-15](/amos#Amos.1.13)).\n\n The national idol worshipped by this people was Molech or Milcom, at whose altar they offered human sacrifices ([1 Kings 11:5](/1kgs#1Kgs.11.5), [7](/1kgs#1Kgs.11.7)). The high places built for this idol by Solomon, at the instigation of his Ammonitish wives, were not destroyed till the time of Josiah ([2 Kings 23:13](/2kgs#2Kgs.23.13))."

                "Arabia Petraea, i.e., the Rocky Arabia, so called from its rocky mountains and stony plains. It comprehended all the north-west portion of the country, and is much better known to travellers than any other portion. This country is, however, divided by modern geographers into (1) Arabia Proper, or the Arabian Peninsula; (2) Northern Arabia, or the Arabian Desert; and (3) Western Arabia, which includes the peninsula of Sinai and the Desert of Petra, originally inhabited by the Horites ([Gen. 14:6](/gen#Gen.14.6), etc.), but in later times by the descendants of Esau, and known as the Land of Edom or Idumea, also as the Desert of Seir or Mount Seir.\n\n The whole land appears ([Gen. 10](/gen#Gen.10)) to have been inhabited by a variety of tribes of different lineage, Ishmaelites, Arabians, Idumeans, Horites, and Edomites; but at length becoming amalgamated, they came to be known by the general designation of Arabs. The modern nation of Arabs is predominantly Ishmaelite. Their language is the most developed and the richest of all the Semitic languages, and is of great value to the student of Hebrew.\n\n The Israelites wandered for forty years in Arabia. In the days of Solomon, and subsequently, commercial intercourse was to a considerable extent kept up with this country ([1 Kings 10:15](/1kgs#1Kgs.10.15); [2 Chr. 9:14](/2chr#2Chr.9.14); [17:11](/2chr#2Chr.17.11)). Arabians were present in Jerusalem at Pentecost ([Acts 2:11](/acts#Acts.2.11)). Paul retired for a season into Arabia after his conversion ([Gal. 1:17](/gal#Gal.1.17)). This country is frequently referred to by the prophets ([Isa. 21:11](/isa#Isa.21.11); [42:11](/isa#Isa.42.11); [Jer. 25:24](/jer#Jer.25.24), etc.)"

It is, however, generally applied to a high and almost inaccessible mountain which rises majestically from the plain of the Araxes. It has two conical peaks, about 7 miles apart, the one 14,300 feet and the other 10,300 feet above the level of the plain. Three thousand feet of the summit of the higher of these peaks is covered with perpetual snow. It is called Kuh-i-nuh, i.e., \u201cNoah\u2019s mountain\u201d, by the Persians. This part of Armenia was inhabited by a people who spoke a language unlike any other now known, though it may have been related to the modern Georgian. About B.C. 900 they borrowed the cuneiform characters of Nineveh, and from this time we have inscriptions of a line of kings who at times contended with Assyria. At the close of the seventh century B.C. the kingdom of Ararat came to an end, and the country was occupied by a people who are ancestors of the Armenians of the present day."

On this \u201cisland\u201d stood sixty walled cities, ruled over by Og. It is called Trachonitis (\u201cthe rugged region\u201d) in the New Testament ([Luke 3:1](/luke#Luke.3.1)). These cities were conquered by the Israelites ([Deut. 3:4](/deut#Deut.3.4); [1 Kings 4:13](/1kgs#1Kgs.4.13)). It is now called the Lejah. Here \u201csixty walled cities are still traceable in a space of 308 square miles. The architecture is ponderous and massive. Solid walls 4 feet thick, and stones on one another without cement; the roofs enormous slabs of basaltic rock, like iron; the doors and gates are of stone 18 inches thick, secured by ponderous bars. The land bears still the appearance of having been called the \u2018land of giants\u2019 under the giant Og.\u201d \u201cI have more than once entered a deserted city in the evening, taken possession of a comfortable house, and spent the night in peace. Many of the houses in the ancient cities of Bashan are perfect, as if only finished yesterday. The walls are sound, the roofs unbroken, and even the window-shutters in their places. These ancient cities of Bashan probably contain the very oldest specimens of domestic architecture in the world\u201d (Porter\u2019s Giant Cities)."

In the time of the judges ([Judg. 1:18](/judg#Judg.1.18)) it fell into the possession of the tribe of Judah; but it was soon after retaken by the Philistines ([2 Sam. 1:20](/2sam#2Sam.1.20)), who were not finally dispossessed till the time of Alexander the Great. Samson went down to this place from Timnath, and slew thirty men and took their spoil. The prophets foretold its destruction ([Jer. 25:20](/jer#Jer.25.20); [47:5](/jer#Jer.47.5), [7](/jer#Jer.47.7)). It became a noted place in the Middle Ages, having been the scene of many a bloody battle between the Saracens and the Crusaders. It was beseiged and taken by Richard the Lion-hearted, and \u201cwithin its walls and towers now standing he held his court.\u201d Among the Tell Amarna tablets are found letters or official despatches from Yadaya, \u201ccaptain of horse and dust of the king\u2019s feet,\u201d to the \u201cgreat king\u201d of Egypt, dated from Ascalon.

It was founded in B.C. 1700 under Bel-kap-kapu, and became an independent and a conquering power, and shook off the yoke of its Babylonian masters. It subdued the whole of Northern Asia. The Assyrians were Semites ([Gen. 10:22](/gen#Gen.10.22)), but in process of time non-Semite tribes mingled with the inhabitants. They were a military people, the \u201cRomans of the East.\u201d\n\n Of the early history of the kingdom of Assyria little is positively known. In B.C. 1120 Tiglath-pileser I., the greatest of the Assyrian kings, \u201ccrossed the Euphrates, defeated the kings of the Hittites, captured the city of Carchemish, and advanced as far as the shores of the Mediterranean.\u201d He may be regarded as the founder of the first Assyrian empire. After this the Assyrians gradually extended their power, subjugating the states of Northern Syria. In the reign of Ahab, king of Israel, Shalmaneser II. marched an army against the Syrian states, whose allied army he encountered and vanquished at Karkar. This led to Ahab\u2019s casting off the yoke of Damascus and allying himself with Judah. Some years after this the Assyrian king marched an army against Hazael, king of Damascus. He besieged and took that city. He also brought under tribute Jehu, and the cities of Tyre and Sidon.\n\n About a hundred years after this (B.C. 745) the crown was seized by a military adventurer called Pul, who assumed the name of Tiglath-pileser III. He directed his armies into Syria, which had by this time regained its independence, and took (B.C. 740) Arpad, near Aleppo, after a siege of three years, and reduced Hamath. Azariah (Uzziah) was an ally of the king of Hamath, and thus was compelled by Tiglath-pileser to do him homage and pay a yearly tribute.\n\n In B.C. 738, in the reign of Menahem, king of Israel, Pul invaded Israel, and imposed on it a heavy tribute ([2 Kings 15:19](/2kgs#2Kgs.15.19)). Ahaz, the king of Judah, when engaged in a war against Israel and Syria, appealed for help to this Assyrian king by means of a present of gold and silver ([2 Kings 16:8](/2kgs#2Kgs.16.8)); who accordingly \u201cmarched against Damascus, defeated and put Rezin to death, and besieged the city itself.\u201d Leaving a portion of his army to continue the siege, \u201che advanced through the province east of Jordan, spreading fire and sword,\u201d and became master of Philistia, and took Samaria and Damascus. He died B.C. 727, and was succeeded by Shalmanezer IV., who ruled till B.C. 722. He also invaded Syria ([2 Kings 17:5](/2kgs#2Kgs.17.5)), but was deposed in favour of Sargon (q.v.) the Tartan, or commander-in-chief of the army, who took Samaria (q.v.) after a siege of three years, and so put an end to the kingdom of Israel, carrying the people away into captivity, B.C. 722 ([2 Kings 17:1-6](/2kgs#2Kgs.17.1), [24](/2kgs#2Kgs.17.24); [18:7](/2kgs#2Kgs.18.7), [9](/2kgs#2Kgs.18.9)). He also overran the land of Judah, and took the city of Jerusalem ([Isa. 10:6](/isa#Isa.10.6), [12](/isa#Isa.10.12), [22](/isa#Isa.10.22), [24](/isa#Isa.10.24), [34](/isa#Isa.10.34)). Mention is next made of Sennacherib (B.C. 705), the son and successor of Sargon ([2 Kings 18:13](/2kgs#2Kgs.18.13); [19:37](/2kgs#2Kgs.19.37); [Isa. 7:17](/isa#Isa.7.17), [18](/isa#Isa.7.18)); and then of Esar-haddon, his son and successor, who took Manasseh, king of Judah, captive, and kept him for some time a prisoner at Babylon, which he alone of all the Assyrian kings made the seat of his government ([2 Kings 19:37](/2kgs#2Kgs.19.37); [Isa. 37:38](/isa#Isa.37.38)).\n\n Assur-bani-pal, the son of Esarhaddon, became king, and in [Ezra 4:10](/ezra#Ezra.4.10) is referred to as Asnapper. From an early period Assyria had entered on a conquering career, and having absorbed Babylon, the kingdoms of Hamath, Damascus, and Samaria, it conquered Phoenicia, and made Judea feudatory, and subjected Philistia and Idumea. At length, however, its power declined. In B.C. 727 the Babylonians threw off the rule of the Assyrians, under the leadership of the powerful Chaldean prince Merodach-baladan ([2 Kings 20:12](/2kgs#2Kgs.20.12)), who, after twelve years, was subdued by Sargon, who now reunited the kingdom, and ruled over a vast empire. But on his death the smouldering flames of rebellion again burst forth, and the Babylonians and Medes successfully asserted their independence (B.C. 625), and Assyria fell according to the prophecies of Isaiah (10:5-19), Nahum (3:19), and Zephaniah (3:13), and the many separate kingdoms of which it was composed ceased to recognize the \u201cgreat king\u201d ([2 Kings 18:19](/2kgs#2Kgs.18.19); [Isa. 36:4](/isa#Isa.36.4)). Ezekiel (31) attests (about B.C. 586) how completely Assyria was overthrown. It ceases to be a nation."

This word has given rise to many different views. Some Jewish interpreters regard it as the name of a place some 12 miles east of Jerusalem, in the wilderness. Others take it to be the name of an evil spirit, or even of Satan. But when we remember that the two goats together form a type of Christ, on whom the Lord \u201claid the iniquity of us all,\u201d and examine into the root meaning of this word (viz., \u201cseparation\u201d), the interpretation of those who regard the one goat as representing the atonement made, and the other, that \u201cfor Azazel,\u201d as representing the effect of the great work of atonement (viz., the complete removal of sin), is certainly to be preferred. The one goat which was \u201cfor Jehovah\u201d was offered as a sin-offering, by which atonement was made. But the sins must also be visibly banished, and therefore they were symbolically laid by confession on the other goat, which was then \u201csent away for Azazel\u201d into the wilderness. The form of this word indicates intensity, and therefore signifies the total separation of sin: it was wholly carried away. It was important that the result of the sacrifices offered by the high priest alone in the sanctuary should be embodied in a visible transaction, and hence the dismissal of the \u201cscape-goat.\u201d It was of no consequence what became of it, as the whole import of the transaction lay in its being sent into the wilderness bearing away sin. As the goat \u201cfor Jehovah\u201d was to witness to the demerit of sin and the need of the blood of atonement, so the goat \u201cfor Azazel\u201d was to witness to the efficacy of the sacrifice and the result of the shedding of blood in the taking away of sin."

                "The name given to the tower which the primitive fathers of our race built in the land of Shinar after the Deluge ([Gen. 11:1-9](/gen#Gen.11.1)). Their object in building this tower was probably that it might be seen as a rallying-point in the extensive plain of Shinar, to which they had emigrated from the uplands of Armenia, and so prevent their being scattered abroad. But God interposed and defeated their design by condounding their language, and hence the name Babel, meaning \u201cconfusion.\u201d In the Babylonian tablets there is an account of this event, and also of the creation and the deluge.\n\n The Temple of Belus, which is supposed to occupy its site, is described by the Greek historian Herodotus as a temple of great extent and magnificence, erected by the Babylonians for their god Belus. The treasures Nebuchadnezzar brought from Jerusalem were laid up in this temple ([2 Chr. 36:7](/2chr#2Chr.36.7)).\n\n The Birs Nimrud, at ancient Borsippa, about 7 miles south-west of Hillah, the modern town which occupies a part of the site of ancient Babylon, and 6 miles from the Euphrates, is an immense mass of broken and fire-blasted fragments, of about 2,300 feet in circumference, rising suddenly to the height of 235 feet above the desert-plain, and is with probability regarded as the ruins of the tower of Babel. This is \u201cone of the most imposing ruins in the country.\u201d Others think it to be the ruins of the Temple of Belus."

            "dictionaryText": " the Greek form of BABEL; Semitic form Babilu, meaning \"The Gate of God.\" In the Assyrian tablets it means \"The city of the dispersion of the tribes.\" The monumental list of its kings reaches back to B.C. 2300, and includes Khammurabi, or Amraphel (q.v.), the contemporary of Abraham. It stood on the Euphrates, about 200 miles above its junction with the Tigris, which flowed through its midst and divided it into two almost equal parts. The Elamites invaded Chaldea (i.e., Lower Mesopotamia, or Shinar, and Upper Mesopotamia, or Accad, now combined into one) and held it in subjection. At length Khammu-rabi delivered it from the foreign yoke, and founded the new empire of Chaldea (q.v.), making Babylon the capital of the united kingdom. This city gradually grew in extent and grandeur, but in process of time it became subject to Assyria. On the fall of Nineveh (B.C. 606) it threw off the Assyrian yoke, and became the capital of the growing Babylonian empire. Under Nebuchadnezzar it became one of the most splendid cities of the ancient world.    After passing through various vicissitudes the city was occupied by Cyrus, \"king of Elam,\" B.C. 538, who issued a decree permitting the Jews to return to their own land (Ezra 1). It then ceased to be the capital of an empire. It was again and again visited by hostile armies, till its inhabitants were all driven from their homes, and the city became a complete desolation, its very site being forgotten from among men.    On the west bank of the Euphrates, about 50 miles south of Bagdad, there is found a series of artificial mounds of vast extent. These are the ruins of this once famous proud city. These ruins are principally (1) the great mound called Babil by the Arabs. This was probably the noted Temple of Belus, which was a pyramid about 480 feet high. (2) The Kasr (i.e., \"the palace\"). This was the great palace of Nebuchadnezzar. It is almost a square, each side of which is about 700 feet long. The little town of Hillah, near the site of Babylon, is built almost wholly of bricks taken from this single mound. (3) A lofty mound, on the summit of which stands a modern tomb called Amran ibn-Ali. This is probably the most ancient portion of the remains of the city, and represents the ruins of the famous hanging-gardens, or perhaps of some royal palace. The utter desolation of the city once called \"The glory of kingdoms\" (Isa.13:19) was foretold by the prophets (Isa.13:4-22;  Jeremiah 25:12  ;  Jeremiah 50:2  Jeremiah 50:3  ;  Daniel 2:31-38  ).    The Babylon mentioned in  1 Peter 5:13   was not Rome, as some have thought, but the literal city of Babylon, which was inhabited by many Jews at the time Peter wrote.    In  Revelation 14:8  ;  16:19  ;  17:5  ; and  18:2  , \"Babylon\" is supposed to mean Rome, not considered as pagan, but as the prolongation of the ancient power in the papal form. Rome, pagan and papal, is regarded as one power. \"The literal Babylon was the beginner and supporter of tyranny and idolatry...This city and its whole empire were taken by the Persians under Cyrus; the Persians were subdued by the Macedonians, and the Macedonians by the Romans; so that Rome succeeded to the power of old Babylon. And it was her method to adopt the worship of the false deities she had conquered; so that by her own act she became the heiress and successor of all the Babylonian idolatry, and of all that was introduced into it by the immediate successors of Babylon, and consequently of all the idolatry of the earth.\" Rome, or \"mystical Babylon,\" is \"that great city which reigneth over the kings of the earth\" ( 17:18  ).",

                "The Greek form of BABEL; Semitic form Babilu, meaning \u201cThe Gate of God.\u201d In the Assyrian tablets it means \u201cThe city of the dispersion of the tribes.\u201d The monumental list of its kings reaches back to B.C. 2300, and includes Khammurabi, or Amraphel (q.v.), the contemporary of Abraham. It stood on the Euphrates, about 200 miles above its junction with the Tigris, which flowed through its midst and divided it into two almost equal parts. The Elamites invaded Chaldea (i.e., Lower Mesopotamia, or Shinar, and Upper Mesopotamia, or Accad, now combined into one) and held it in subjection. At length Khammu-rabi delivered it from the foreign yoke, and founded the new empire of Chaldea (q.v.), making Babylon the capital of the united kingdom. This city gradually grew in extent and grandeur, but in process of time it became subject to Assyria. On the fall of Nineveh (B.C. 606) it threw off the Assyrian yoke, and became the capital of the growing Babylonian empire. Under Nebuchadnezzar it became one of the most splendid cities of the ancient world.\n\n After passing through various vicissitudes the city was occupied by Cyrus, \u201cking of Elam,\u201d B.C. 538, who issued a decree permitting the Jews to return to their own land ([Ezra 1](/ezra#Ezra.1)). It then ceased to be the capital of an empire. It was again and again visited by hostile armies, till its inhabitants were all driven from their homes, and the city became a complete desolation, its very site being forgotten from among men.\n\n On the west bank of the Euphrates, about 50 miles south of Bagdad, there is found a series of artificial mounds of vast extent. These are the ruins of this once famous proud city. These ruins are principally (1) the great mound called Babil by the Arabs. This was probably the noted Temple of Belus, which was a pyramid about 480 feet high. (2) The Kasr (i.e., \u201cthe palace\u201d). This was the great palace of Nebuchadnezzar. It is almost a square, each side of which is about 700 feet long. The little town of Hillah, near the site of Babylon, is built almost wholly of bricks taken from this single mound. (3) A lofty mound, on the summit of which stands a modern tomb called Amran ibn-Ali. This is probably the most ancient portion of the remains of the city, and represents the ruins of the famous hanging-gardens, or perhaps of some royal palace. The utter desolation of the city once called \u201cThe glory of kingdoms\u201d ([Isa. 13:19](/isa#Isa.13.19)) was foretold by the prophets ([Isa. 13:4-22](/isa#Isa.13.4); [Jer. 25:12](/jer#Jer.25.12); [50:2](/jer#Jer.50.2), [3](/jer#Jer.50.3); [Dan. 2:31-38](/dan#Dan.2.31)).\n\n The Babylon mentioned in [1 Pet. 5:13](/1pet#1Pet.5.13) was not Rome, as some have thought, but the literal city of Babylon, which was inhabited by many Jews at the time Peter wrote.\n\n In [Rev. 14:8](/rev#Rev.14.8); [16:19](/rev#Rev.16.19); [17:5](/rev#Rev.17.5); and 18:2, \u201cBabylon\u201d is supposed to mean Rome, not considered as pagan, but as the prolongation of the ancient power in the papal form. Rome, pagan and papal, is regarded as one power. \u201cThe literal Babylon was the beginner and supporter of tyranny and idolatry...This city and its whole empire were taken by the Persians under Cyrus; the Persians were subdued by the Macedonians, and the Macedonians by the Romans; so that Rome succeeded to the power of old Babylon. And it was her method to adopt the worship of the false deities she had conquered; so that by her own act she became the heiress and successor of all the Babylonian idolatry, and of all that was introduced into it by the immediate successors of Babylon, and consequently of all the idolatry of the earth.\u201d Rome, or \u201cmystical Babylon,\u201d is \u201cthat great city which reigneth over the kings of the earth\u201d (17:18)."

At the time of Israel\u2019s entrance into the Promised Land, Og came out against them, but was utterly routed ([Num. 21:33-35](/num#Num.21.33); [Deut. 3:1-7](/deut#Deut.3.1)). This country extended from Gilead in the south to Hermon in the north, and from the Jordan on the west to Salcah on the east. Along with the half of Gilead it was given to the half-tribe of Manasseh ([Josh. 13:29-31](/josh#Josh.13.29)). Golan, one of its cities, became a \u201ccity of refuge\u201d ([Josh. 21:27](/josh#Josh.21.27)). Argob, in Bashan, was one of Solomon\u2019s commissariat districts ([1 Kings 4:13](/1kgs#1Kgs.4.13)). The cities of Bashan were taken by Hazael ([2 Kings 10:33](/2kgs#2Kgs.10.33)), but were soon after reconquered by Jehoash ([2 Kings 13:25](/2kgs#2Kgs.13.25)), who overcame the Syrians in three battles, according to the word of Elisha (19). From this time Bashan almost disappears from history, although we read of the wild cattle of its rich pastures ([Ezek. 39:18](/ezek#Ezek.39.18); [Ps. 22:12](/ps#Ps.22.12)), the oaks of its forests ([Isa. 2:13](/isa#Isa.2.13); [Ezek. 27:6](/ezek#Ezek.27.6); [Zech. 11:2](/zech#Zech.11.2)), and the beauty of its extensive plains ([Amos 4:1](/amos#Amos.4.1); [Jer. 50:19](/jer#Jer.50.19)). Soon after the conquest, the name \u201cGilead\u201d was given to the whole country beyond Jordan. After the Exile, Bashan was divided into four districts,"

On re-opening it, Isaac gave it the same name ([Gen. 26:31-33](/gen#Gen.26.31)). It was a favourite place of abode of both of these patriarchs (21:33-22:1, 19; 26:33; 28:10). It is mentioned among the \u201ccities\u201d given to the tribe of Simeon ([Josh. 19:2](/josh#Josh.19.2); [1 Chr. 4:28](/1chr#1Chr.4.28)). From Dan to Beersheba, a distance of about 144 miles ([Judg. 20:1](/judg#Judg.20.1); [1 Chr. 21:2](/1chr#1Chr.21.2); [2 Sam. 24:2](/2sam#2Sam.24.2)), became the usual way of designating the whole Promised Land, and passed into a proverb. After the return from the Captivity the phrase is narrowed into \u201cfrom Beersheba unto the valley of Hinnom\u201d ([Neh. 11:30](/neh#Neh.11.30)). The kingdom of the ten tribes extended from Beersheba to Mount Ephraim ([2 Chr. 19:4](/2chr#2Chr.19.4)). The name is not found in the New Testament. It is still called by the Arabs Bir es-Seba, i.e., \u201cwell of the seven\u201d, where there are to the present day two principal wells and five smaller ones. It is nearly midway between the southern end of the Dead Sea and the Mediterranean."

It was a place of considerable strength and importance. It is called a \u201cmother in Israel\u201d, i.e., a metropolis ([2 Sam. 20:19](/2sam#2Sam.20.19)). It was besieged by Joab ([2 Sam. 20:14](/2sam#2Sam.20.14)), by Benhadad ([1 Kings 15:20](/1kgs#1Kgs.15.20)), and by Tiglath-pileser ([2 Kings 15:29](/2kgs#2Kgs.15.29)) about B.C. 734. It is elsewhere called Abel-maim, meadow of the waters, ([2 Chr. 16:4](/2chr#2Chr.16.4)). Its site is occupied by the modern Abil or Abil-el-kamh, on a rising ground to the east of the brook Derdarah, which flows through the plain of Huleh into the Jordan, about 6 miles to the west-north-west of Dan."

                "A place in Central Palestine, about 10 miles north of Jerusalem, at the head of the pass of Michmash and Ai. It was originally the royal Canaanite city of Luz ([Gen. 28:19](/gen#Gen.28.19)). The name Bethel was at first apparently given to the sanctuary in the neighbourhood of Luz, and was not given to the city itself till after its conquest by the tribe of Ephraim. When Abram entered Canaan he formed his second encampment between Bethel and Hai ([Gen. 12:8](/gen#Gen.12.8)); and on his return from Egypt he came back to it, and again \u201ccalled upon the name of the Lord\u201d (13:4). Here Jacob, on his way from Beersheba to Haran, had a vision of the angels of God ascending and descending on the ladder whose top reached unto heaven (28:10, 19); and on his return he again visited this place, \u201cwhere God talked with him\u201d (35:1-15), and there he \u201cbuilt an altar, and called the place El-beth-el\u201d (q.v.). To this second occasion of God\u2019s speaking with Jacob at Bethel, Hosea (12:4, 5) makes reference.\n\n In troublous times the people went to Bethel to ask counsel of God ([Judg. 20:18](/judg#Judg.20.18), [31](/judg#Judg.20.31); 21:2). Here the ark of the covenant was kept for a long time under the care of Phinehas, the grandson of Aaron (20:26-28). Here also Samuel held in rotation his court of justice ([1 Sam. 7:16](/1sam#1Sam.7.16)). It was included in Israel after the kingdom was divided, and it became one of the seats of the worship of the golden calf ([1 Kings 12:28-33](/1kgs#1Kgs.12.28); [13:1](/1kgs#1Kgs.13.1)). Hence the prophet Hosea ([Hos. 4:15](/hos#Hos.4.15); [5:8](/hos#Hos.5.8); [10:5](/hos#Hos.10.5), [8](/hos#Hos.10.8)) calls it in contempt Beth-aven, i.e., \u201chouse of idols.\u201d Bethel remained an abode of priests even after the kingdom of Israel was desolated by the king of Assyria ([2 Kings 17:28](/2kgs#2Kgs.17.28), [29](/2kgs#2Kgs.17.29)). At length all traces of the idolatries were extirpated by Josiah, king of Judah ([2 Kings 23:15-18](/2kgs#2Kgs.23.15)); and the place was still in existence after the Captivity ([Ezra 2:28](/ezra#Ezra.2.28); [Neh. 7:32](/neh#Neh.7.32)). It has been identified with the ruins of Beitin, a small village amid extensive ruins some 9 miles south of Shiloh."

Eusebius the historian (A.D. 330) calls it \u201cthe sheep-pool.\u201d It is also called \u201cBethsaida\u201d and \u201cBeth-zatha\u201d ([John 5:2](/john#John.5.2), R.V. marg.). Under these \u201cporches\u201d or colonnades were usually a large number of infirm people waiting for the \u201ctroubling of the water.\u201d It is usually identified with the modern so-called Fountain of the Virgin, in the valley of the Kidron, and not far from the Pool of Siloam (q.v.); and also with the Birket Israel, a pool near the mouth of the valley which runs into the Kidron south of \u201cSt. Stephen\u2019s Gate.\u201d Others again identify it with the twin pools called the \u201cSouterrains,\u201d under the convent of the Sisters of Zion, situated in what must have been the rock-hewn ditch between Bezetha and the fortress of Antonia. But quite recently Schick has discovered a large tank, as sketched here, situated about 100 feet north-west of St. Anne\u2019s Church, which is, as he contends, very probably the Pool of Bethesda. No certainty as to its identification, however, has as yet been arrived at."

It was also called Beth-lehem Ephratah ([Micah 5:2](/mic#Mic.5.2)), Beth-lehem-judah ([1 Sam. 17:12](/1sam#1Sam.17.12)), and \u201cthe city of David\u201d ([Luke 2:4](/luke#Luke.2.4)). It is first noticed in Scripture as the place where Rachel died and was buried \u201cby the wayside,\u201d directly to the north of the city ([Gen. 48:7](/gen#Gen.48.7)). The valley to the east was the scene of the story of Ruth the Moabitess. There are the fields in which she gleaned, and the path by which she and Naomi returned to the town. Here was David\u2019s birth-place, and here also, in after years, he was anointed as king by Samuel ([1 Sam. 16:4-13](/1sam#1Sam.16.4)); and it was from the well of Bethlehem that three of his heroes brought water for him at the risk of their lives when he was in the cave of Adullam ([2 Sam. 23:13-17](/2sam#2Sam.23.13)). But it was distinguished above every other city as the birth-place of \u201cHim whose goings forth have been of old\u201d ([Matt. 2:6](/matt#Matt.2.6); comp. [Micah 5:2](/mic#Mic.5.2)). Afterwards Herod, \u201cwhen he saw that he was mocked of the wise men,\u201d sent and slew \u201call the children that were in Bethlehem, and in all the coasts thereof, from two years old and under\u201d ([Matt. 2:16](/matt#Matt.2.16), [18](/matt#Matt.2.18); [Jer. 31:15](/jer#Jer.31.15)).\n\n Bethlehem bears the modern name of Beit-Lahm, i.e., \u201chouse of flesh.\u201d It is about 5 miles south of Jerusalem, standing at an elevation of about 2,550 feet above the sea, thus 100 feet higher than Jerusalem.\n\n There is a church still existing, built by Constantine the Great (A.D. 330), called the \u201cChurch of the Nativity,\u201d over a grotto or cave called the \u201choly crypt,\u201d and said to be the \u201cstable\u201d in which Jesus was born. This is perhaps the oldest existing Christian church in the world. Close to it is another grotto, where Jerome the Latin father is said to have spent thirty years of his life in translating the Scriptures into Latin."

According to some its original name was Baal-Gad ([Josh. 11:17](/josh#Josh.11.17)), or Baal-Hermon ([Judg. 3:3](/judg#Judg.3.3); [1 Chr. 5:23](/1chr#1Chr.5.23)), when it was a Canaanite sanctuary of Baal. It was afterwards called Panium or Paneas, from a deep cavern full of water near the town. This name was given to the cavern by the Greeks of the Macedonian kingdom of Antioch because of its likeness to the grottos of Greece, which were always associated with the worship of their god Pan. Its modern name is Banias. Here Herod built a temple, which he dedicated to Augustus Caesar. This town was afterwards enlarged and embellished by Herod Philip, the tetrarch of Trachonitis, of whose territory it formed a part, and was called by him Caesarea Philippi, partly after his own name, and partly after that of the emperor Tiberius Caesar. It is thus distinguished from the Caesarea of Palestine."

It is also mentioned as the birth-place of Nathanael (21:2). It is not mentioned in the Old Testament. It has been identified with the modern Kana el-Jelil, also called Khurbet Kana, a place 8 or 9 miles north of Nazareth. Others have identified it with Kefr Kenna, which lies on the direct road to the Sea of Galilee, about 5 miles north-east of Nazareth, and 12 in a direct course from Tiberias. It is called \u201cCana of Galilee,\u201d to distinguish it from Cana of Asher ([Josh. 19:28](/josh#Josh.19.28))."

                "Nahum\u2019s town, a Galilean city frequently mentioned in the history of our Lord. It is not mentioned in the Old Testament. After our Lord\u2019s expulsion from Nazareth ([Matt. 4:13-16](/matt#Matt.4.13); [Luke 4:16-31](/luke#Luke.4.16)), Capernaum became his \u201cown city.\u201d It was the scene of many acts and incidents of his life ([Matt. 8:5](/matt#Matt.8.5), [14](/matt#Matt.8.14), [15](/matt#Matt.8.15); 9:2-6, 10-17; 15:1-20; [Mark 1:32-34](/mark#Mark.1.32), etc.). The impenitence and unbelief of its inhabitants after the many evidences our Lord gave among them of the truth of his mission, brought down upon them a heavy denunciation of judgement ([Matt. 11:23](/matt#Matt.11.23)).\n\n It stood on the western shore of the Sea of Galilee. The \u201cland of Gennesaret,\u201d near, if not in, which it was situated, was one of the most prosperous and crowded districts of Palestine. This city lay on the great highway from Damascus to Acco and Tyre. It has been identified with Tell Hum, about two miles south-west of where the Jordan flows into the lake. Here are extensive ruins of walls and foundations, and also the remains of what must have been a beautiful synagogue, which it is conjectured may have been the one built by the centurion ([Luke 7:5](/luke#Luke.7.5)), in which our Lord frequently taught ([John 6:59](/john#John.6.59); [Mark 1:21](/mark#Mark.1.21); [Luke 4:33](/luke#Luke.4.33)). Others have conjectured that the ruins of the city are to be found at Khan Minyeh, some three miles further to the south on the shore of the lake. \u201cIf Tell Hum be Capernaum, the remains spoken of are without doubt the ruins of the synagogue built by the Roman centurion, and one of the most sacred places on earth. It was in this building that our Lord gave the well-known discourse in [John 6](/john#John.6); and it was not without a certain strange feeling that on turning over a large block we found the pot of manna engraved on its face, and remembered the words, \u2018I am that bread of life: your fathers did eat manna in the wilderness, and are dead.\u2019\u201d, (The Recovery of Jerusalem.)"

The name is found written in hieroglyphics in the temple of Kom Ombos in Upper Egypt. But the exact situation of Caphtor is unknown, though it is supposed to be Crete, since the Philistines seem to be meant by the \u201cCherethites\u201d in [1 Sam. 30:14](/1sam#1Sam.30.14) (see also [2 Sam. 8:18](/2sam#2Sam.8.18)). It may, however, have been a part of Egypt, the Caphtur in the north Delta, since the Caphtorim were of the same race as the Mizraite people ([Gen. 10:14](/gen#Gen.10.14); [1 Chr. 1:12](/1chr#1Chr.1.12))."

                "The southern portion of Babylonia, Lower Mesopotamia, lying chiefly on the right bank of the Euphrates, but commonly used of the whole of the Mesopotamian plain. The Hebrew name is Kasdim, which is usually rendered \u201cChaldeans\u201d ([Jer. 50:10](/jer#Jer.50.10); [51:24](/jer#Jer.51.24), [35](/jer#Jer.51.35)).\n\n The country so named is a vast plain formed by the deposits of the Euphrates and the Tigris, extending to about 400 miles along the course of these rivers, and about 100 miles in average breadth. \u201cIn former days the vast plains of Babylon were nourished by a complicated system of canals and water-courses, which spread over the surface of the country like a network. The wants of a teeming population were supplied by a rich soil, not less bountiful than that on the banks of the Egyptian Nile. Like islands rising from a golden sea of waving corn stood frequent groves of palm-trees and pleasant gardens, affording to the idler or traveller their grateful and highly-valued shade. Crowds of passengers hurried along the dusty roads to and from the busy city. The land was rich in corn and wine.\u201d\n\n Recent discoveries, more especially in Babylonia, have thrown much light on the history of the Hebrew patriarchs, and have illustrated or confirmed the Biblical narrative in many points. The ancestor of the Hebrew people, Abram, was, we are told, born at \u201cUr of the Chaldees.\u201d \u201cChaldees\u201d is a mistranslation of the Hebrew Kasdim, Kasdim being the Old Testament name of the Babylonians, while the Chaldees were a tribe who lived on the shores of the Persian Gulf, and did not become a part of the Babylonian population till the time of Hezekiah. Ur was one of the oldest and most famous of the Babylonian cities. Its site is now called Mugheir, or Mugayyar, on the western bank of the Euphrates, in Southern Babylonia. About a century before the birth of Abram it was ruled by a powerful dynasty of kings. Their conquests extended to Elam on the one side, and to the Lebanon on the other. They were followed by a dynasty of princes whose capital was Babylon, and who seem to have been of South Arabian origin. The founder of the dynasty was Sumu-abi (\u201cShem is my father\u201d). But soon afterwards Babylonia fell under Elamite dominion. The kings of Babylon were compelled to acknowledge the supremacy of Elam, and a rival kingdom to that of Babylon, and governed by Elamites, sprang up at Larsa, not far from Ur, but on the opposite bank of the river. In the time of Abram the king of Larsa was Eri-Aku, the son of an Elamite prince, and Eri-Aku, as has long been recognized, is the Biblical \u201cArioch king of Ellasar\u201d ([Gen. 14:1](/gen#Gen.14.1)). The contemporaneous king of Babylon in the north, in the country termed Shinar in Scripture, was Khammu-rabi."

It has been supposed to be identical with the river Habor, the Chaboras, or modern Khabour, which falls into the Euphrates at Circesium. To the banks of this river some of the Israelites were removed by the Assyrians ([2 Kings 17:6](/2kgs#2Kgs.17.6)). An opinion that has much to support it is that the \u201cChebar\u201d was the royal canal of Nebuchadnezzar, the Nahr Malcha, the greatest in Mesopotamia, which connected the Tigris with the Euphrates, in the excavation of which the Jewish captives were probably employed."

It has by some been identified as the Wady el-Kelt behind Jericho, which is formed by the junction of many streams flowing from the mountains west of Jericho. It is dry in summer. Travellers have described it as one of the wildest ravines of this wild region, and peculiarly fitted to afford a secure asylum to the persecuted. But if the prophet\u2019s interview with Ahab was in Samaria, and he thence journeyed toward the east, it is probable that he crossed Jordan and found refuge in some of the ravines of Gilead. The \u201cbrook\u201d is said to have been \u201cbefore Jordan,\u201d which probably means that it opened toward that river, into which it flowed. This description would apply to the east as well as to the west of Jordan. Thus Elijah\u2019s hiding-place may have been the Jermuk, in the territory of the half-tribe of Manasseh."

                "Plural cherubim, the name of certain symbolical figures frequently mentioned in Scripture. They are first mentioned in connection with the expulsion of our first parents from Eden ([Gen. 3:24](/gen#Gen.3.24)). There is no intimation given of their shape or form. They are next mentioned when Moses was commanded to provide furniture for the tabernacle ([Ex. 25:17-20](/exod#Exod.25.17); [26:1](/exod#Exod.26.1), [31](/exod#Exod.26.31)). God promised to commune with Moses \u201cfrom between the cherubim\u201d (25:22). This expression was afterwards used to denote the Divine abode and presence ([Num. 7:89](/num#Num.7.89); [1 Sam. 4:4](/1sam#1Sam.4.4); [Isa. 37:16](/isa#Isa.37.16); [Ps. 80:1](/ps#Ps.80.1); [99:1](/ps#Ps.99.1)). In Ezekiel\u2019s vision (10:1-20) they appear as living creatures supporting the throne of God. From Ezekiel\u2019s description of them (1;10; 41:18, 19), they appear to have been compound figures, unlike any real object in nature; artificial images possessing the features and properties of several animals. Two cherubim were placed on the mercy-seat of the ark; two of colossal size overshadowed it in Solomon\u2019s temple. Ezekiel (1:4-14) speaks of four; and this number of \u201cliving creatures\u201d is mentioned in [Rev. 4:6](/rev#Rev.4.6). Those on the ark are called the \u201ccherubim of glory\u201d ([Heb. 9:5](/heb#Heb.9.5)), i.e., of the Shechinah, or cloud of glory, for on them the visible glory of God rested. They were placed one at each end of the mercy-seat, with wings stretched upward, and their faces \u201ctoward each other and toward the mercy-seat.\u201d They were anointed with holy oil, like the ark itself and the other sacred furniture.\n\n The cherubim were symbolical. They were intended to represent spiritual existences in immediate contact with Jehovah. Some have regarded them as symbolical of the chief ruling power by which God carries on his operations in providence ([Ps. 18:10](/ps#Ps.18.10)). Others interpret them as having reference to the redemption of men, and as symbolizing the great rulers or ministers of the church. Many other opinions have been held regarding them which need not be referred to here. On the whole, it seems to be most satisfactory to regard the interpretation of the symbol to be variable, as is the symbol itself.\n\n Their office was, (1) on the expulsion of our first parents from Eden, to prevent all access to the tree of life; and (2) to form the throne and chariot of Jehovah in his manifestation of himself on earth. He dwelleth between and sitteth on the cherubim ([1 Sam. 4:4](/1sam#1Sam.4.4); [Ps. 80:1](/ps#Ps.80.1); [Ezek. 1:26](/ezek#Ezek.1.26), [28](/ezek#Ezek.1.28))."

It does not appear that Paul had visited this city when he wrote his letter to the church there ([Col. 1:2](/col#Col.1.2)). He expresses in his letter to Philemon (ver. 1:22) his hope to visit it on being delivered from his imprisonment. From [Col. 1:7](/col#Col.1.7); [4:12](/col#Col.4.12) it has been concluded that Epaphras was the founder of the Colossian church.

                "A son, probably the eldest, of Ham, and the father of Nimrod ([Gen. 10:8](/gen#Gen.10.8); [1 Chr. 1:10](/1chr#1Chr.1.10)). From him the land of Cush seems to have derived its name. The question of the precise locality of the land of Cush has given rise to not a little controversy. The second river of Paradise surrounded the whole land of Cush ([Gen. 2:13](/gen#Gen.2.13), R.V.). The term Cush is in the Old Testament generally applied to the countries south of the Israelites. It was the southern limit of Egypt ([Ezek. 29:10](/ezek#Ezek.29.10), A.V. \u201cEthiopia,\u201d Heb. Cush), with which it is generally associated ([Ps. 68:31](/ps#Ps.68.31); [Isa. 18:1](/isa#Isa.18.1); [Jer. 46:9](/jer#Jer.46.9), etc.). It stands also associated with Elam ([Isa. 11:11](/isa#Isa.11.11)), with Persia ([Ezek. 38:5](/ezek#Ezek.38.5)), and with the Sabeans ([Isa. 45:14](/isa#Isa.45.14)). From these facts it has been inferred that Cush included Arabia and the country on the west coast of the Red Sea. Rawlinson takes it to be the country still known as Khuzi-stan, on the east side of the Lower Tigris. But there are intimations which warrant the conclusion that there was also a Cush in Africa, the Ethiopia (so called by the Greeks) of Africa. Ezekiel speaks (29:10; comp. 30:4-6) of it as lying south of Egypt. It was the country now known to us as Nubia and Abyssinia ([Isa. 18:1](/isa#Isa.18.1); [Zeph. 3:10](/zeph#Zeph.3.10), Heb. Cush). In ancient Egyptian inscriptions Ethiopia is termed Kesh. The Cushites appear to have spread along extensive tracts, stretching from the Upper Nile to the Euphrates and Tigris. At an early period there was a stream of migration of Cushites \u201cfrom Ethiopia, properly so called, through Arabia, Babylonia, and Persia, to Western India.\u201d The Hamite races, soon after their arrival in Africa, began to spread north, east, and west. Three branches of the Cushite or Ethiopian stock, moving from Western Asia, settled in the regions contiguous to the Persian Gulf. One branch, called the Cossaeans, settled in the mountainous district on the east of the Tigris, known afterwards as Susiana; another occupied the lower regions of the Euphrates and the Tigris; while a third colonized the southern shores and islands of the gulf, whence they afterwards emigrated to the Mediterranean and settled on the coast of Palestine as the Phoenicians. Nimrod was a great Cushite chief. He conquered the Accadians, a Tauranian race, already settled in Mesopotamia, and founded his kingdom, the Cushites mingling with the Accads, and so forming the Chaldean nation."

                "The fifth son of Jacob. His mother was Bilhah, Rachel\u2019s maid ([Gen. 30:6](/gen#Gen.30.6), \u201cGod hath judged me\u201d, Heb. dananni). The blessing pronounced on him by his father was, \u201cDan shall judge his people\u201d (49:16), probably in allusion to the judgeship of Samson, who was of the tribe of Dan.\n\n The tribe of Dan had their place in the march through the wilderness on the north side of the tabernacle ([Num. 2:25](/num#Num.2.25), [31](/num#Num.2.31); 10:25). It was the last of the tribes to receive a portion in the Land of Promise. Its position and extent are described in [Josh. 19:40-48](/josh#Josh.19.40).\n\n The territory of Dan extended from the west of that of Ephraim and Benjamin to the sea. It was a small territory, but was very fertile. It included in it, among others, the cities of Lydda, Ekron, and Joppa, which formed its northern boundary. But this district was too limited. \u201cSqueezed into the narrow strip between the mountains and the sea, its energies were great beyond its numbers.\u201d Being pressed by the Amorites and the Philistines, whom they were unable to conquer, they longed for a wider space. They accordingly sent out five spies from two of their towns, who went north to the sources of the Jordan, and brought back a favourable report regarding that region. \u201cArise,\u201d they said, \u201cbe not slothful to go, and to possess the land,\u201d for it is \u201ca place where there is no want of any thing that is in the earth\u201d ([Judg. 18:10](/judg#Judg.18.10)). On receiving this report, 600 Danites girded on their weapons of war, and taking with them their wives and their children, marched to the foot of Hermon, and fought against Leshem, and took it from the Sidonians, and dwelt therein, and changed the name of the conquered town to Dan ([Josh. 19:47](/josh#Josh.19.47)). This new city of Dan became to them a new home, and was wont to be spoken of as the northern limit of Palestine, the length of which came to be denoted by the expression \u201cfrom Dan to Beersheba\u201d, i.e., about 144 miles.\n\n \u201cBut like Lot under a similar temptation, they seem to have succumbed to the evil influences around them, and to have sunk down into a condition of semi-heathenism from which they never emerged. The mounds of ruins which mark the site of the city show that it covered a considerable extent of ground. But there remains no record of any noble deed wrought by the degenerate tribe. Their name disappears from the roll-book of the natural and the spiritual Israel.\u201d, Manning\u2019s Those Holy Fields.\n\n This old border city was originally called Laish. Its modern name is Tell el-Kady, \u201cHill of the Judge.\u201d It stands about four miles below Caesarea Philippi, in the midst of a region of surpassing richness and beauty."

                "A small town on the eastern part of the upland plain of Lycaonia, about 20 miles from Lystra. Paul passed through Derbe on his route from Cilicia to Iconium, on his second missionary journey ([Acts 16:1](/acts#Acts.16.1)), and probably also on his third journey (18:23; 19:1). On his first journey (14:20, 21) he came to Derbe from the other side; i.e., from Iconium. It was the native place of Gaius, one of Paul\u2019s companions (20:4). He did not here suffer persecution ([2 Tim. 3:11](/2tim#2Tim.3.11))."

On this very battle-field, twenty years before, the Philistines routed the Israelites, \u201cand slew of the army in the field about four thousand men\u201d (4:1, 2; here, and at 5:1, called \u201cEben-ezer\u201d by anticipation). In this extremity the Israelites fetched the ark out of Shiloh and carried it into their camp. The Philistines a second time immediately attacked them, and smote them with a very great slaughter, \u201cfor there fell of Israel thirty thousand footmen. And the ark of God was taken\u201d ([1 Sam. 4:10](/1sam#1Sam.4.10)). And now in the same place the Philistines are vanquished, and the memorial stone is erected by Samuel (q.v.). The spot where the stone was erected was somewhere \u201cbetween Mizpeh and Shen.\u201d Some have identified it with the modern Beit Iksa, a conspicuous and prominent position, apparently answering all the necessary conditions; others with Dier Aban, 3 miles east of \u2018Ain Shems."

It has been placed in Armenia, in the region west of the Caspian Sea, in Media, near Damascus, in Palestine, in Southern Arabia, and in Babylonia. The site must undoubtedly be sought for somewhere along the course of the great streams the Tigris and the Euphrates of Western Asia, in \u201cthe land of Shinar\u201d or Babylonia. The region from about lat. 33 degrees 30\u2019 to lat. 31 degrees, which is a very rich and fertile tract, has been by the most competent authorities agreed on as the probable site of Eden. \u201cIt is a region where streams abound, where they divide and re-unite, where alone in the Mesopotamian tract can be found the phenomenon of a single river parting into four arms, each of which is or has been a river of consequence.\u201d\n\n Among almost all nations there are traditions of the primitive innocence of our race in the garden of Eden. This was the \u201cgolden age\u201d to which the Greeks looked back. Men then lived a \u201clife free from care, and without labour and sorrow. Old age was unknown; the body never lost its vigour; existence was a perpetual feast without a taint of evil. The earth brought forth spontaneously all things that were good in profuse abundance.\u201d"

It was called the land, or \u201cthe mountain of Seir,\u201d the rough hills on the east side of the Arabah. It extended from the head of the Gulf of Akabah, the Elanitic gulf, to the foot of the Dead Sea ([1 Kings 9:26](/1kgs#1Kgs.9.26)), and contained, among other cities, the rock-hewn Sela (q.v.), generally known by the Greek name Petra ([2 Kings 14:7](/2kgs#2Kgs.14.7)). It is a wild and rugged region, traversed by fruitful valleys. Its old capital was Bozrah ([Isa. 63:1](/isa#Isa.63.1)). The early inhabitants of the land were Horites. They were destroyed by the Edomites ([Deut. 2:12](/deut#Deut.2.12)), between whom and the kings of Israel and Judah there was frequent war ([2 Kings 8:20](/2kgs#2Kgs.8.20); [2 Chr. 28:17](/2chr#2Chr.28.17)).\n\n At the time of the Exodus they churlishly refused permission to the Israelites to pass through their land ([Num. 20:14-21](/num#Num.20.14)), and ever afterwards maintained an attitude of hostility toward them. They were conquered by David ([2 Sam. 8:14](/2sam#2Sam.8.14); comp. [1 Kings 9:26](/1kgs#1Kgs.9.26)), and afterwards by Amaziah ([2 Chr. 25:11](/2chr#2Chr.25.11), [12](/2chr#2Chr.25.12)). But they regained again their independence, and in later years, during the decline of the Jewish kingdom ([2 Kings 16:6](/2kgs#2Kgs.16.6); R.V. marg., \u201cEdomites\u201d), made war against Israel. They took part with the Chaldeans when Nebuchadnezzar captured Jerusalem, and afterwards they invaded and held possession of the south of Palestine as far as Hebron. At length, however, Edom fell under the growing Chaldean power ([Jer. 27:3](/jer#Jer.27.3), [6](/jer#Jer.27.6)).\n\n There are many prophecies concerning Edom ([Isa. 34:5](/isa#Isa.34.5), [6](/isa#Isa.34.6); [Jer. 49:7-18](/jer#Jer.49.7); [Ezek. 25:13](/ezek#Ezek.25.13); [35:1-15](/ezek#Ezek.35.1); [Joel 3:19](/joel#Joel.3.19); [Amos 1:11](/amos#Amos.1.11); Obad.; [Mal. 1:3](/mal#Mal.1.3), [4](/mal#Mal.1.4)) which have been remarkably fulfilled. The present desolate condition of that land is a standing testimony to the inspiration of these prophecies. After an existence as a people for above seventeen hundred years, they have utterly disappeared, and their language even is forgotten for ever. In Petra, \u201cwhere kings kept their court, and where nobles assembled, there no man dwells; it is given by lot to birds, and beasts, and reptiles.\u201d\n\n The Edomites were Semites, closely related in blood and in language to the Israelites. They dispossessed the Horites of Mount Seir; though it is clear, from [Gen. 36](/gen#Gen.36), that they afterwards intermarried with the conquered population. Edomite tribes settled also in the south of Judah, like the Kenizzites ([Gen. 36:11](/gen#Gen.36.11)), to whom Caleb and Othniel belonged ([Josh. 15:17](/josh#Josh.15.17)). The southern part of Edom was known as Teman."

                "One of the chief towns of the kingdom of Bashan ([Josh. 12:4](/josh#Josh.12.4), [5](/josh#Josh.12.5)). Here Og was defeated by the Israelites, and the strength of the Amorites broken ([Num. 21:33-35](/num#Num.21.33)). It subsequently belonged to Manasseh, for a short time apparently, and afterwards became the abode of banditti and outlaws ([Josh. 13:31](/josh#Josh.13.31)). It has been identified with the modern Edr\u2019a, which stands on a rocky promontory on the south-west edge of the Lejah (the Argob of the Hebrews, and Trachonitis of the Greeks). The ruins of Edr\u2019a are the most extensive in the Hauran. They are 3 miles in circumference. A number of the ancient houses still remain; the walls, roofs, and doors being all of stone. The wild region of which Edrei was the capital is thus described in its modern aspect: \u201cElevated about 20 feet above the plain, it is a labyrinth of clefts and crevasses in the rock, formed by volcanic action; and owing to its impenetrable condition, it has become a refuge for outlaws and turbulent characters, who make it a sort of Cave of Adullam...It is, in fact, an impregnable natural fortress, about 20 miles in length and 15 in breadth\u201d (Porter\u2019s Syria, etc.). Beneath this wonderful city there is also a subterranean city, hollowed out probably as a refuge for the population of the upper city in times of danger."

                "The land of the Nile and the pyramids, the oldest kingdom of which we have any record, holds a place of great significance in Scripture.\n\n The Egyptians belonged to the white race, and their original home is still a matter of dispute. Many scholars believe that it was in Southern Arabia, and recent excavations have shown that the valley of the Nile was originally inhabited by a low-class population, perhaps belonging to the Nigritian stock, before the Egyptians of history entered it. The ancient Egyptian language, of which the latest form is Coptic, is distantly connected with the Semitic family of speech.\n\n Egypt consists geographically of two halves, the northern being the Delta, and the southern Upper Egypt, between Cairo and the First Cataract. In the Old Testament, Northern or Lower Egypt is called Mazor, \u201cthe fortified land\u201d ([Isa. 19:6](/isa#Isa.19.6); [37](/isa#Isa.37): 25, where the A.V. mistranslates \u201cdefence\u201d and \u201cbesieged places\u201d); while Southern or Upper Egypt is Pathros, the Egyptian Pa-to-Res, or \u201cthe land of the south\u201d ([Isa. 11:11](/isa#Isa.11.11)). But the whole country is generally mentioned under the dual name of Mizraim, \u201cthe two Mazors.\u201d\n\n The civilization of Egypt goes back to a very remote antiquity. The two kingdoms of the north and south were united by Menes, the founder of the first historical dynasty of kings. The first six dynasties constitute what is known as the Old Empire, which had its capital at Memphis, south of Cairo, called in the Old Testament Moph ([Hos. 9:6](/hos#Hos.9.6)) and Noph. The native name was Mennofer, \u201cthe good place.\u201d\n\n The Pyramids were tombs of the monarchs of the Old Empire, those of Gizeh being erected in the time of the Fourth Dynasty. After the fall of the Old Empire came a period of decline and obscurity. This was followed by the Middle Empire, the most powerful dynasty of which was the Twelfth. The Fayyum was rescued for agriculture by the kings of the Twelfth Dynasty; and two obelisks were erected in front of the temple of the sun-god at On or Heliopolis (near Cairo), one of which is still standing. The capital of the Middle Empire was Thebes, in Upper Egypt.\n\n The Middle Empire was overthrown by the invasion of the Hyksos, or shepherd princes from Asia, who ruled over Egypt, more especially in the north, for several centuries, and of whom there were three dynasties of kings. They had their capital at Zoan or Tanis (now San), in the north-eastern part of the Delta. It was in the time of the Hyksos that Abraham, Jacob, and Joseph entered Egypt. The Hyksos were finally expelled about B.C. 1600, by the hereditary princes of Thebes, who founded the Eighteenth Dynasty, and carried the war into Asia. Canaan and Syria were subdued, as well as Cyprus, and the boundaries of the Egyptian Empire were fixed at the Euphrates. The Soudan, which had been conquered by the kings of the Twelfth Dynasty, was again annexed to Egypt, and the eldest son of the Pharaoh took the title of \u201cPrince of Cush.\u201d\n\n One of the later kings of the dynasty, Amenophis IV., or Khu-n-Aten, endeavoured to supplant the ancient state religion of Egypt by a new faith derived from Asia, which was a sort of pantheistic monotheism, the one supreme god being adored under the image of the solar disk. The attempt led to religious and civil war, and the Pharaoh retreated from Thebes to Central Egypt, where he built a new capital, on the site of the present Tell-el-Amarna. The cuneiform tablets that have been found there represent his foreign correspondence (about B.C. 1400). He surrounded himself with officials and courtiers of Asiatic, and more especially Canaanitish, extraction; but the native party succeeded eventually in overthrowing the government, the capital of Khu-n-Aten was destroyed, and the foreigners were driven out of the country, those that remained being reduced to serfdom.\n\n The national triumph was marked by the rise of the Nineteenth Dynasty, in the founder of which, Rameses I., we must see the \u201cnew king, who knew not Joseph.\u201d His grandson, Rameses II., reigned sixty-seven years (B.C. 1348-1281), and was an indefatigable builder. As Pithom, excavated by Dr. Naville in 1883, was one of the cities he built, he must have been the Pharaoh of the Oppression. The Pharaoh of the Exodus may have been one of his immediate successors, whose reigns were short. Under them Egypt lost its empire in Asia, and was itself attacked by barbarians from Libya and the north.\n\n The Nineteenth Dynasty soon afterwards came to an end; Egypt was distracted by civil war; and for a short time a Canaanite, Arisu, ruled over it.\n\n Then came the Twentieth Dynasty, the second Pharaoh of which, Rameses III., restored the power of his country. In one of his campaigns he overran the southern part of Palestine, where the Israelites had not yet settled. They must at the time have been still in the wilderness. But it was during the reign of Rameses III. that Egypt finally lost Gaza and the adjoining cities, which were seized by the Pulista, or Philistines.\n\n After Rameses III., Egypt fell into decay. Solomon married the daughter of one of the last kings of the Twenty-first Dynasty, which was overthrown by Shishak I., the general of the Libyan mercenaries, who founded the Twenty-second Dynasty ([1 Kings 11:40](/1kgs#1Kgs.11.40); [14:25](/1kgs#1Kgs.14.25), [26](/1kgs#1Kgs.14.26)). A list of the places he captured in Palestine is engraved on the outside of the south wall of the temple of Karnak.\n\n In the time of Hezekiah, Egypt was conquered by Ethiopians from the Soudan, who constituted the Twenty-fifth Dynasty. The third of them was Tirhakah ([2 Kings 19:9](/2kgs#2Kgs.19.9)). In B.C. 674 it was conquered by the Assyrians, who divided it into twenty satrapies, and Tirhakah was driven back to his ancestral dominions. Fourteen years later it successfully revolted under Psammetichus I. of Sais, the founder of the Twenty-sixth Dynasty. Among his successors were Necho ([2 Kings 23:29](/2kgs#2Kgs.23.29)) and Hophra, or Apries ([Jer. 37:5](/jer#Jer.37.5), [7](/jer#Jer.37.7), [11](/jer#Jer.37.11)). The dynasty came to an end in B.C. 525, when the country was subjugated by Cambyses. Soon afterwards it was organized into a Persian satrapy.\n\n The title of Pharaoh, given to the Egyptian kings, is the Egyptian Per-aa, or \u201cGreat House,\u201d which may be compared to that of \u201cSublime Porte.\u201d It is found in very early Egyptian texts.\n\n The Egyptian religion was a strange mixture of pantheism and animal worship, the gods being adored in the form of animals. While the educated classes resolved their manifold deities into manifestations of one omnipresent and omnipotent divine power, the lower classes regarded the animals as incarnations of the gods.\n\n Under the Old Empire, Ptah, the Creator, the god of Memphis, was at the head of the Pantheon; afterwards Amon, the god of Thebes, took his place. Amon, like most of the other gods, was identified with Ra, the sun-god of Heliopolis.\n\n The Egyptians believed in a resurrection and future life, as well as in a state of rewards and punishments dependent on our conduct in this world. The judge of the dead was Osiris, who had been slain by Set, the representative of evil, and afterwards restored to life. His death was avenged by his son Horus, whom the Egyptians invoked as their \u201cRedeemer.\u201d Osiris and Horus, along with Isis, formed a trinity, who were regarded as representing the sun-god under different forms.\n\n Even in the time of Abraham, Egypt was a flourishing and settled monarchy. Its oldest capital, within the historic period, was Memphis, the ruins of which may still be seen near the Pyramids and the Sphinx. When the Old Empire of Menes came to an end, the seat of empire was shifted to Thebes, some 300 miles farther up the Nile. A short time after that, the Delta was conquered by the Hyksos, or shepherd kings, who fixed their capital at Zoan, the Greek Tanis, now San, on the Tanic arm of the Nile. All this occurred before the time of the new king \u201cwhich knew not Joseph\u201d ([Ex. 1:8](/exod#Exod.1.8)). In later times Egypt was conquered by the Persians (B.C. 525), and by the Greeks under Alexander the Great (B.C. 332), after whom the Ptolemies ruled the country for three centuries. Subsequently it was for a time a province of the Roman Empire; and at last, in A.D. 1517, it fell into the hands of the Turks, of whose empire it still forms nominally a part. Abraham and Sarah went to Egypt in the time of the shepherd kings. The exile of Joseph and the migration of Jacob to \u201cthe land of Goshen\u201d occurred about 200 years later. On the death of Solomon, Shishak, king of Egypt, invaded Palestine ([1 Kings 14:25](/1kgs#1Kgs.14.25)). He left a list of the cities he conquered.\n\n A number of remarkable clay tablets, discovered at Tell-el-Amarna in Upper Egypt, are the most important historical records ever found in connection with the Bible. They most fully confirm the historical statements of the Book of Joshua, and prove the antiquity of civilization in Syria and Palestine. As the clay in different parts of Palestine differs, it has been found possible by the clay alone to decide where the tablets come from when the name of the writer is lost. The inscriptions are cuneiform, and in the Aramaic language, resembling Assyrian. The writers are Phoenicians, Amorites, and Philistines, but in no instance Hittites, though Hittites are mentioned. The tablets consist of official dispatches and letters, dating from B.C. 1480, addressed to the two Pharaohs, Amenophis III. and IV., the last of this dynasty, from the kings and governors of Phoenicia and Palestine. There occur the names of three kings killed by Joshua, Adoni-zedec, king of Jerusalem, Japhia, king of Lachish ([Josh. 10:3](/josh#Josh.10.3)), and Jabin, king of Hazor (11:1); also the Hebrews (Abiri) are said to have come from the desert.\n\n The principal prophecies of Scripture regarding Egypt are these, [Isa. 19](/isa#Isa.19); [Jer. 43](/jer#Jer.43): 8-13; 44:30; 46; [Ezek. 29](/ezek#Ezek.29)-32; and it might be easily shown that they have all been remarkably fulfilled. For example, the singular disappearance of Noph (i.e., Memphis) is a fulfilment of [Jer. 46:19](/jer#Jer.46.19), [Ezek. 30:13](/ezek#Ezek.30.13)."

Many scholars believe that it was in Southern Arabia, and recent excavations have shown that the valley of the Nile was originally inhabited by a low-class population, perhaps belonging to the Nigritian stock, before the Egyptians of history entered it. The ancient Egyptian language, of which the latest form is Coptic, is distantly connected with the Semitic family of speech.   Egypt consists geographically of two halves, the northern being the Delta, and the southern Upper Egypt, between Cairo and the First Cataract. In the Old Testament, Northern or Lower Egypt is called Mazor, \"the fortified land\" ( Isaiah 19:6  ;  37:  :  25  , where the A.V. mistranslates \"defence\" and \"besieged places\"); while Southern or Upper Egypt is Pathros, the Egyptian Pa-to-Res, or \"the land of the south\" ( Isaiah 11:11  ). But the whole country is generally mentioned under the dual name of Mizraim, \"the two Mazors.\"    The civilization of Egypt goes back to a very remote antiquity. The two kingdoms of the north and south were united by Menes, the founder of the first historical dynasty of kings. The first six dynasties constitute what is known as the Old Empire, which had its capital at Memphis, south of Cairo, called in the Old Testament Moph ( Hosea 9:6  ) and Noph. The native name was Mennofer, \"the good place.\"    The Pyramids were tombs of the monarchs of the Old Empire, those of Gizeh being erected in the time of the Fourth Dynasty. After the fall of the Old Empire came a period of decline and obscurity. This was followed by the Middle Empire, the most powerful dynasty of which was the Twelfth. The Fayyum was rescued for agriculture by the kings of the Twelfth Dynasty; and two obelisks were erected in front of the temple of the sun-god at On or Heliopolis (near Cairo), one of which is still standing. The capital of the Middle Empire was Thebes, in Upper Egypt.   The Middle Empire was overthrown by the invasion of the Hyksos, or shepherd princes from Asia, who ruled over Egypt, more especially in the north, for several centuries, and of whom there were three dynasties of kings. They had their capital at Zoan or Tanis (now San), in the north-eastern part of the Delta. It was in the time of the Hyksos that Abraham, Jacob, and Joseph entered Egypt. The Hyksos were finally expelled about B.C. 1600, by the hereditary princes of Thebes, who founded the Eighteenth Dynasty, and carried the war into Asia. Canaan and Syria were subdued, as well as Cyprus, and the boundaries of the Egyptian Empire were fixed at the Euphrates. The Soudan, which had been conquered by the kings of the Twelfth Dynasty, was again annexed to Egypt, and the eldest son of the Pharaoh took the title of \"Prince of Cush.\"    One of the later kings of the dynasty, Amenophis IV., or Khu-n-Aten, endeavoured to supplant the ancient state religion of Egypt by a new faith derived from Asia, which was a sort of pantheistic monotheism, the one supreme god being adored under the image of the solar disk. The attempt led to religious and civil war, and the Pharaoh retreated from Thebes to Central Egypt, where he built a new capital, on the site of the present Tell-el-Amarna. The cuneiform tablets that have been found there represent his foreign correspondence (about B.C. 1400). He surrounded himself with officials and courtiers of Asiatic, and more especially Canaanitish, extraction; but the native party succeeded eventually in overthrowing the government, the capital of Khu-n-Aten was destroyed, and the foreigners were driven out of the country, those that remained being reduced to serfdom.    The national triumph was marked by the rise of the Nineteenth Dynasty, in the founder of which, Rameses I., we must see the \"new king, who knew not Joseph.\" His grandson, Rameses II., reigned sixty-seven years (B.C. 1348-1281), and was an indefatigable builder. As Pithom, excavated by Dr. Naville in 1883, was one of the cities he built, he must have been the Pharaoh of the Oppression. The Pharaoh of the Exodus may have been one of his immediate successors, whose reigns were short. Under them Egypt lost its empire in Asia, and was itself attacked by barbarians from Libya and the north.    The Nineteenth Dynasty soon afterwards came to an end; Egypt was distracted by civil war; and for a short time a Canaanite, Arisu, ruled over it.   Then came the Twentieth Dynasty, the second Pharaoh of which, Rameses III., restored the power of his country. In one of his campaigns he overran the southern part of Palestine, where the Israelites had not yet settled. They must at the time have been still in the wilderness. But it was during the reign of Rameses III. that Egypt finally lost Gaza and the adjoining cities, which were seized by the Pulista, or Philistines.   After Rameses III., Egypt fell into decay. Solomon married the daughter of one of the last kings of the Twenty-first Dynasty, which was overthrown by Shishak I., the general of the Libyan mercenaries, who founded the Twenty-second Dynasty ( 1 Kings 11:40  ;  1 Kings 14:25  1 Kings 14:26  ). A list of the places he captured in Palestine is engraved on the outside of the south wall of the temple of Karnak.    In the time of Hezekiah, Egypt was conquered by Ethiopians from the Soudan, who constituted the Twenty-fifth Dynasty. The third of them was Tirhakah ( 2 Kings 19:9  ). In B.C. 674 it was conquered by the Assyrians, who divided it into twenty satrapies, and Tirhakah was driven back to his ancestral dominions. Fourteen years later it successfully revolted under Psammetichus I. of Sais, the founder of the Twenty-sixth Dynasty. Among his successors were Necho ( 2 Kings 23:29  ) and Hophra, or Apries ( Jeremiah 37:5  Jeremiah 37:7  Jeremiah 37:11  ). The dynasty came to an end in B.C. 525, when the country was subjugated by Cambyses. Soon afterwards it was organized into a Persian satrapy.    The title of Pharaoh, given to the Egyptian kings, is the Egyptian Per-aa, or \"Great House,\" which may be compared to that of \"Sublime Porte.\" It is found in very early Egyptian texts.   The Egyptian religion was a strange mixture of pantheism and animal worship, the gods being adored in the form of animals. While the educated classes resolved their manifold deities into manifestations of one omnipresent and omnipotent divine power, the lower classes regarded the animals as incarnations of the gods.   Under the Old Empire, Ptah, the Creator, the god of Memphis, was at the head of the Pantheon; afterwards Amon, the god of Thebes, took his place. Amon, like most of the other gods, was identified with Ra, the sun-god of Heliopolis.   The Egyptians believed in a resurrection and future life, as well as in a state of rewards and punishments dependent on our conduct in this world. The judge of the dead was Osiris, who had been slain by Set, the representative of evil, and afterwards restored to life. His death was avenged by his son Horus, whom the Egyptians invoked as their \"Redeemer.\" Osiris and Horus, along with Isis, formed a trinity, who were regarded as representing the sun-god under different forms.   Even in the time of Abraham, Egypt was a flourishing and settled monarchy. Its oldest capital, within the historic period, was Memphis, the ruins of which may still be seen near the Pyramids and the Sphinx. When the Old Empire of Menes came to an end, the seat of empire was shifted to Thebes, some 300 miles farther up the Nile. A short time after that, the Delta was conquered by the Hyksos, or shepherd kings, who fixed their capital at Zoan, the Greek Tanis, now San, on the Tanic arm of the Nile. All this occurred before the time of the new king \"which knew not Joseph\" ( Exodus 1:8  ). In later times Egypt was conquered by the Persians (B.C. 525), and by the Greeks under Alexander the Great (B.C. 332), after whom the Ptolemies ruled the country for three centuries. Subsequently it was for a time a province of the Roman Empire; and at last, in A.D. 1517, it fell into the hands of the Turks, of whose empire it still forms nominally a part. Abraham and Sarah went to Egypt in the time of the shepherd kings. The exile of Joseph and the migration of Jacob to \"the land of Goshen\" occurred about 200 years later. On the death of Solomon, Shishak, king of Egypt, invaded Palestine ( 1 Kings 14:25  ). He left a list of the cities he conquered.    A number of remarkable clay tablets, discovered at Tell-el-Amarna in Upper Egypt, are the most important historical records ever found in connection with the Bible. They most fully confirm the historical statements of the Book of Joshua, and prove the antiquity of civilization in Syria and Palestine. As the clay in different parts of Palestine differs, it has been found possible by the clay alone to decide where the tablets come from when the name of the writer is lost. The inscriptions are cuneiform, and in the Aramaic language, resembling Assyrian. The writers are Phoenicians, Amorites, and Philistines, but in no instance Hittites, though Hittites are mentioned. The tablets consist of official dispatches and letters, dating from B.C. 1480, addressed to the two Pharaohs, Amenophis III. and IV., the last of this dynasty, from the kings and governors of Phoenicia and Palestine. There occur the names of three kings killed by Joshua, Adoni-zedec, king of Jerusalem, Japhia, king of Lachish ( Joshua 10:3  ), and Jabin, king of Hazor ( 11:1  ); also the Hebrews (Abiri) are said to have come from the desert.    The principal prophecies of Scripture regarding Egypt are these,  Isaiah 19  ;  Jeremiah 43:  :   813  -13;  44:30  ;  46  ; Ezek. 29-32; and it might be easily shown that they have all been remarkably fulfilled. For example, the singular disappearance of Noph (i.e., Memphis) is a fulfilment of  Jeremiah 46:19  ,  Ezekiel 30:13  . ",

                "The land of the Nile and the pyramids, the oldest kingdom of which we have any record, holds a place of great significance in Scripture.\n\n The Egyptians belonged to the white race, and their original home is still a matter of dispute. Many scholars believe that it was in Southern Arabia, and recent excavations have shown that the valley of the Nile was originally inhabited by a low-class population, perhaps belonging to the Nigritian stock, before the Egyptians of history entered it. The ancient Egyptian language, of which the latest form is Coptic, is distantly connected with the Semitic family of speech.\n\n Egypt consists geographically of two halves, the northern being the Delta, and the southern Upper Egypt, between Cairo and the First Cataract. In the Old Testament, Northern or Lower Egypt is called Mazor, \u201cthe fortified land\u201d ([Isa. 19:6](/isa#Isa.19.6); [37](/isa#Isa.37): 25, where the A.V. mistranslates \u201cdefence\u201d and \u201cbesieged places\u201d); while Southern or Upper Egypt is Pathros, the Egyptian Pa-to-Res, or \u201cthe land of the south\u201d ([Isa. 11:11](/isa#Isa.11.11)). But the whole country is generally mentioned under the dual name of Mizraim, \u201cthe two Mazors.\u201d\n\n The civilization of Egypt goes back to a very remote antiquity. The two kingdoms of the north and south were united by Menes, the founder of the first historical dynasty of kings. The first six dynasties constitute what is known as the Old Empire, which had its capital at Memphis, south of Cairo, called in the Old Testament Moph ([Hos. 9:6](/hos#Hos.9.6)) and Noph. The native name was Mennofer, \u201cthe good place.\u201d\n\n The Pyramids were tombs of the monarchs of the Old Empire, those of Gizeh being erected in the time of the Fourth Dynasty. After the fall of the Old Empire came a period of decline and obscurity. This was followed by the Middle Empire, the most powerful dynasty of which was the Twelfth. The Fayyum was rescued for agriculture by the kings of the Twelfth Dynasty; and two obelisks were erected in front of the temple of the sun-god at On or Heliopolis (near Cairo), one of which is still standing. The capital of the Middle Empire was Thebes, in Upper Egypt.\n\n The Middle Empire was overthrown by the invasion of the Hyksos, or shepherd princes from Asia, who ruled over Egypt, more especially in the north, for several centuries, and of whom there were three dynasties of kings. They had their capital at Zoan or Tanis (now San), in the north-eastern part of the Delta. It was in the time of the Hyksos that Abraham, Jacob, and Joseph entered Egypt. The Hyksos were finally expelled about B.C. 1600, by the hereditary princes of Thebes, who founded the Eighteenth Dynasty, and carried the war into Asia. Canaan and Syria were subdued, as well as Cyprus, and the boundaries of the Egyptian Empire were fixed at the Euphrates. The Soudan, which had been conquered by the kings of the Twelfth Dynasty, was again annexed to Egypt, and the eldest son of the Pharaoh took the title of \u201cPrince of Cush.\u201d\n\n One of the later kings of the dynasty, Amenophis IV., or Khu-n-Aten, endeavoured to supplant the ancient state religion of Egypt by a new faith derived from Asia, which was a sort of pantheistic monotheism, the one supreme god being adored under the image of the solar disk. The attempt led to religious and civil war, and the Pharaoh retreated from Thebes to Central Egypt, where he built a new capital, on the site of the present Tell-el-Amarna. The cuneiform tablets that have been found there represent his foreign correspondence (about B.C. 1400). He surrounded himself with officials and courtiers of Asiatic, and more especially Canaanitish, extraction; but the native party succeeded eventually in overthrowing the government, the capital of Khu-n-Aten was destroyed, and the foreigners were driven out of the country, those that remained being reduced to serfdom.\n\n The national triumph was marked by the rise of the Nineteenth Dynasty, in the founder of which, Rameses I., we must see the \u201cnew king, who knew not Joseph.\u201d His grandson, Rameses II., reigned sixty-seven years (B.C. 1348-1281), and was an indefatigable builder. As Pithom, excavated by Dr. Naville in 1883, was one of the cities he built, he must have been the Pharaoh of the Oppression. The Pharaoh of the Exodus may have been one of his immediate successors, whose reigns were short. Under them Egypt lost its empire in Asia, and was itself attacked by barbarians from Libya and the north.\n\n The Nineteenth Dynasty soon afterwards came to an end; Egypt was distracted by civil war; and for a short time a Canaanite, Arisu, ruled over it.\n\n Then came the Twentieth Dynasty, the second Pharaoh of which, Rameses III., restored the power of his country. In one of his campaigns he overran the southern part of Palestine, where the Israelites had not yet settled. They must at the time have been still in the wilderness. But it was during the reign of Rameses III. that Egypt finally lost Gaza and the adjoining cities, which were seized by the Pulista, or Philistines.\n\n After Rameses III., Egypt fell into decay. Solomon married the daughter of one of the last kings of the Twenty-first Dynasty, which was overthrown by Shishak I., the general of the Libyan mercenaries, who founded the Twenty-second Dynasty ([1 Kings 11:40](/1kgs#1Kgs.11.40); [14:25](/1kgs#1Kgs.14.25), [26](/1kgs#1Kgs.14.26)). A list of the places he captured in Palestine is engraved on the outside of the south wall of the temple of Karnak.\n\n In the time of Hezekiah, Egypt was conquered by Ethiopians from the Soudan, who constituted the Twenty-fifth Dynasty. The third of them was Tirhakah ([2 Kings 19:9](/2kgs#2Kgs.19.9)). In B.C. 674 it was conquered by the Assyrians, who divided it into twenty satrapies, and Tirhakah was driven back to his ancestral dominions. Fourteen years later it successfully revolted under Psammetichus I. of Sais, the founder of the Twenty-sixth Dynasty. Among his successors were Necho ([2 Kings 23:29](/2kgs#2Kgs.23.29)) and Hophra, or Apries ([Jer. 37:5](/jer#Jer.37.5), [7](/jer#Jer.37.7), [11](/jer#Jer.37.11)). The dynasty came to an end in B.C. 525, when the country was subjugated by Cambyses. Soon afterwards it was organized into a Persian satrapy.\n\n The title of Pharaoh, given to the Egyptian kings, is the Egyptian Per-aa, or \u201cGreat House,\u201d which may be compared to that of \u201cSublime Porte.\u201d It is found in very early Egyptian texts.\n\n The Egyptian religion was a strange mixture of pantheism and animal worship, the gods being adored in the form of animals. While the educated classes resolved their manifold deities into manifestations of one omnipresent and omnipotent divine power, the lower classes regarded the animals as incarnations of the gods.\n\n Under the Old Empire, Ptah, the Creator, the god of Memphis, was at the head of the Pantheon; afterwards Amon, the god of Thebes, took his place. Amon, like most of the other gods, was identified with Ra, the sun-god of Heliopolis.\n\n The Egyptians believed in a resurrection and future life, as well as in a state of rewards and punishments dependent on our conduct in this world. The judge of the dead was Osiris, who had been slain by Set, the representative of evil, and afterwards restored to life. His death was avenged by his son Horus, whom the Egyptians invoked as their \u201cRedeemer.\u201d Osiris and Horus, along with Isis, formed a trinity, who were regarded as representing the sun-god under different forms.\n\n Even in the time of Abraham, Egypt was a flourishing and settled monarchy. Its oldest capital, within the historic period, was Memphis, the ruins of which may still be seen near the Pyramids and the Sphinx. When the Old Empire of Menes came to an end, the seat of empire was shifted to Thebes, some 300 miles farther up the Nile. A short time after that, the Delta was conquered by the Hyksos, or shepherd kings, who fixed their capital at Zoan, the Greek Tanis, now San, on the Tanic arm of the Nile. All this occurred before the time of the new king \u201cwhich knew not Joseph\u201d ([Ex. 1:8](/exod#Exod.1.8)). In later times Egypt was conquered by the Persians (B.C. 525), and by the Greeks under Alexander the Great (B.C. 332), after whom the Ptolemies ruled the country for three centuries. Subsequently it was for a time a province of the Roman Empire; and at last, in A.D. 1517, it fell into the hands of the Turks, of whose empire it still forms nominally a part. Abraham and Sarah went to Egypt in the time of the shepherd kings. The exile of Joseph and the migration of Jacob to \u201cthe land of Goshen\u201d occurred about 200 years later. On the death of Solomon, Shishak, king of Egypt, invaded Palestine ([1 Kings 14:25](/1kgs#1Kgs.14.25)). He left a list of the cities he conquered.\n\n A number of remarkable clay tablets, discovered at Tell-el-Amarna in Upper Egypt, are the most important historical records ever found in connection with the Bible. They most fully confirm the historical statements of the Book of Joshua, and prove the antiquity of civilization in Syria and Palestine. As the clay in different parts of Palestine differs, it has been found possible by the clay alone to decide where the tablets come from when the name of the writer is lost. The inscriptions are cuneiform, and in the Aramaic language, resembling Assyrian. The writers are Phoenicians, Amorites, and Philistines, but in no instance Hittites, though Hittites are mentioned. The tablets consist of official dispatches and letters, dating from B.C. 1480, addressed to the two Pharaohs, Amenophis III. and IV., the last of this dynasty, from the kings and governors of Phoenicia and Palestine. There occur the names of three kings killed by Joshua, Adoni-zedec, king of Jerusalem, Japhia, king of Lachish ([Josh. 10:3](/josh#Josh.10.3)), and Jabin, king of Hazor (11:1); also the Hebrews (Abiri) are said to have come from the desert.\n\n The principal prophecies of Scripture regarding Egypt are these, [Isa. 19](/isa#Isa.19); [Jer. 43](/jer#Jer.43): 8-13; 44:30; 46; [Ezek. 29](/ezek#Ezek.29)-32; and it might be easily shown that they have all been remarkably fulfilled. For example, the singular disappearance of Noph (i.e., Memphis) is a fulfilment of [Jer. 46:19](/jer#Jer.46.19), [Ezek. 30:13](/ezek#Ezek.30.13)."

The name Elam is an Assyrian word meaning \u201chigh.\u201d\n\n \u201cThe inhabitants of Elam, or \u2018the Highlands,\u2019 to the east of Babylon, were called Elamites. They were divided into several branches, speaking different dialects of the same agglutinative language. The race to which they belonged was brachycephalic, or short-headed, like the pre-Semitic Sumerians of Babylonia.\n\n \u201cThe earliest Elamite kingdom seems to have been that of Anzan, the exact site of which is uncertain; but in the time of Abraham, Shushan or Susa appears to have already become the capital of the country. Babylonia was frequently invaded by the Elamite kings, who at times asserted their supremacy over it (as in the case of Chedorlaomer, the Kudur-Lagamar, or \u2018servant of the goddess Lagamar,\u2019 of the cuneiform texts).\n\n \u201cThe later Assyrian monarchs made several campaigns against Elam, and finally Assur-bani-pal (about B.C. 650) succeeded in conquering the country, which was ravaged with fire and sword. On the fall of the Assyrian Empire, Elam passed into the hands of the Persians\u201d (A.H. Sayce).\n\n This country was called by the Greeks Cissia or Susiana."

Here they probably remained some considerable time. The form of expression in [Ex. 16:1](/exod#Exod.16.1) seems to imply that the people proceeded in detachments or companies from Elim, and only for the first time were assembled as a complete host when they reached the wilderness of Sin (q.v.)."

The \u201cfountain\u201d from which it derives its name rises on the mountain side about 600 feet above the sea, and in its rapid descent spreads luxuriance all around it. Along its banks the osher grows abundantly. That shrub is thus described by Porter: \u201cThe stem is stout, measuring sometimes nearly a foot in diameter, and the plant grows to the height of 15 feet or more. It has a grayish bark and long oval leaves, which when broken off discharge a milky fluid. The fruit resembles an apple, and hangs in clusters of two or three. When ripe it is of a rich yellow colour, but on being pressed it explodes like a puff-ball. It is chiefly filled with air...This is the so-called \u2018apple of Sodom.\u2019\u201d Through Samaria, etc."

In the time of the Romans it bore the title of \"the first and greatest metropolis of Asia.\" It was distinguished for the Temple of Diana (q.v.), who there had her chief shrine; and for its theatre, which was the largest in the world, capable of containing 50,000 spectators. It was, like all ancient theatres, open to the sky. Here were exhibited the fights of wild beasts and of men with beasts. (Compare  1 Corinthians 4:9  ;  1 Corinthians 9:24  1 Corinthians 9:25  ;  15:32  .)    Many Jews took up their residence in this city, and here the seeds of the gospel were sown immediately after Pentecost ( Acts 2:9  ;  6:9  ). At the close of his second missionary journey (about A.D. 51), when Paul was returning from Greece to Syria ( 18:18-21  ), he first visited this city. He remained, however, for only a short time, as he was hastening to keep the feast, probably of Pentecost, at Jerusalem; but he left Aquila and Priscilla behind him to carry on the work of spreading the gospel.    During his third missionary journey Paul reached Ephesus from the \"upper coasts\" ( Acts 19:1  ), i.e., from the inland parts of Asia Minor, and tarried here for about three years; and so successful and abundant were his labours that \"all they which dwelt in Asia heard the word of the Lord Jesus, both Jews and Greeks\" ( 19:10  ). Probably during this period the seven churches of the Apocalypse were founded, not by Paul's personal labours, but by missionaries whom he may have sent out from Ephesus, and by the influence of converts returning to their homes.    On his return from his journey, Paul touched at Miletus, some 30 miles south of Ephesus ( Acts 20:15  ), and sending for the presbyters of Ephesus to meet him there, he delivered to them that touching farewell charge which is recorded in  Acts 20:18-35  . Ephesus is not again mentioned till near the close of Paul's life, when he writes to Timothy exhorting him to \"abide still at Ephesus\" ( 1 Timothy 1:3  ).    Two of Paul's companions, Trophimus and Tychicus, were probably natives of Ephesus ( Acts 20:4  ;  21:29  ;  2  Tim  4:12  ). In his second epistle to Timothy, Paul speaks of Onesiphorus as having served him in many things at Ephesus ( 2 Timothy 1:18  ). He also \"sent Tychicus to Ephesus\" ( 4:12  ), probably to attend to the interests of the church there. Ephesus is twice mentioned in the Apocalypse ( 1:11  ;  2:1  ).    The apostle John, according to tradition, spent many years in Ephesus, where he died and was buried.   A part of the site of this once famous city is now occupied by a small Turkish village, Ayasaluk, which is regarded as a corruption of the two Greek words, hagios theologos; i.e., \"the holy divine.\" ",

It was probably the city of the Archevites, who were transplanted to Samaria by Asnapper ([Ezra 4:9](/ezra#Ezra.4.9)). It lay on the left bank of the Euphrates, about 120 miles south-east of Babylon, and is now represented by the mounds and ruins of Warka. It appears to have been the necropolis of the Assyrian kings, as the whole region is strewed with bricks and the remains of coffins. \u201cStanding on the summit of the principal edifice, called the Buwarizza, a tower 200 feet square in the centre of the ruins, the beholder is struck with astonishment at the enormous accumulation of mounds and ancient relics at his feet.

                "Hairy, Rebekah\u2019s first-born twin son ([Gen. 25:25](/gen#Gen.25.25)). The name of Edom, \u201cred\u201d, was also given to him from his conduct in connection with the red lentil \u201cpottage\u201d for which he sold his birthright (30, 31). The circumstances connected with his birth foreshadowed the enmity which afterwards subsisted between the twin brothers and the nations they founded (25:22, 23, 26). In process of time Jacob, following his natural bent, became a shepherd; while Esau, a \u201cson of the desert,\u201d devoted himself to the perilous and toilsome life of a huntsman. On a certain occasion, on returning from the chase, urged by the cravings of hunger, Esau sold his birthright to his brother, Jacob, who thereby obtained the covenant blessing ([Gen. 27:28](/gen#Gen.27.28), [29](/gen#Gen.27.29), [36](/gen#Gen.27.36); [Heb. 12:16](/heb#Heb.12.16), [17](/heb#Heb.12.17)). He afterwards tried to regain what he had so recklessly parted with, but was defeated in his attempts through the stealth of his brother ([Gen. 27:4](/gen#Gen.27.4), [34](/gen#Gen.27.34), [38](/gen#Gen.27.38)).\n\n At the age of forty years, to the great grief of his parents, he married ([Gen. 26:34](/gen#Gen.26.34), [35](/gen#Gen.26.35)) two Canaanitish maidens, Judith, the daughter of Beeri, and Bashemath, the daughter of Elon. When Jacob was sent away to Padan-aram, Esau tried to conciliate his parents ([Gen. 28:8](/gen#Gen.28.8), [9](/gen#Gen.28.9)) by marrying his cousin Mahalath, the daughter of Ishmael. This led him to cast in his lot with the Ishmaelite tribes; and driving the Horites out of Mount Seir, he settled in that region. After some thirty years\u2019 sojourn in Padan-aram Jacob returned to Canaan, and was reconciled to Esau, who went forth to meet him (33:4). Twenty years after this, Isaac their father died, when the two brothers met, probably for the last time, beside his grave (35:29). Esau now permanently left Canaan, and established himself as a powerful and wealthy chief in the land of Edom (q.v.).\n\n Long after this, when the descendants of Jacob came out of Egypt, the Edomites remembered the old quarrel between the brothers, and with fierce hatred they warred against Israel."

                "Hebrew, Perath; Assyrian, Purat; Persian cuneiform, Ufratush, whence Greek Euphrates, meaning \u201csweet water.\u201d The Assyrian name means \u201cthe stream,\u201d or \u201cthe great stream.\u201d It is generally called in the Bible simply \u201cthe river\u201d ([Ex. 23:31](/exod#Exod.23.31)), or \u201cthe great river\u201d ([Deut. 1:7](/deut#Deut.1.7)).\n\n The Euphrates is first mentioned in [Gen. 2:14](/gen#Gen.2.14) as one of the rivers of Paradise. It is next mentioned in connection with the covenant which God entered into with Abraham (15:18), when he promised to his descendants the land from the river of Egypt to the river Euphrates (comp. [Deut. 11:24](/deut#Deut.11.24); [Josh. 1:4](/josh#Josh.1.4)), a covenant promise afterwards fulfilled in the extended conquests of David ([2 Sam. 8:2-14](/2sam#2Sam.8.2); [1 Chr. 18:3](/1chr#1Chr.18.3); [1 Kings 4:24](/1kgs#1Kgs.4.24)). It was then the boundary of the kingdom to the north-east. In the ancient history of Assyria, and Babylon, and Egypt many events are recorded in which mention is made of the \u201cgreat river.\u201d Just as the Nile represented in prophecy the power of Egypt, so the Euphrates represented the Assyrian power ([Isa. 8:7](/isa#Isa.8.7); [Jer. 2:18](/jer#Jer.2.18)).\n\n It is by far the largest and most important of all the rivers of Western Asia. From its source in the Armenian mountains to the Persian Gulf, into which it empties itself, it has a course of about 1,700 miles. It has two sources, (1) the Frat or Kara-su (i.e., \u201cthe black river\u201d), which rises 25 miles north-east of Erzeroum; and (2) the Muradchai (i.e., \u201cthe river of desire\u201d), which rises near Ararat, on the northern slope of Ala-tagh. At Kebban Maden, 400 miles from the source of the former, and 270 from that of the latter, they meet and form the majestic stream, which is at length joined by the Tigris at Koornah, after which it is called Shat-el-Arab, which runs in a deep and broad stream for above 140 miles to the sea. It is estimated that the alluvium brought down by these rivers encroaches on the sea at the rate of about one mile in thirty years."

Out of Galilee ariseth no prophet.\u201d This saying of theirs was \u201cnot historically true, for two prophets at least had arisen from Galilee, Jonah of Gath-hepher, and the greatest of all the prophets, Elijah of Thisbe, and perhaps also Nahum and Hosea. Their contempt for Galilee made them lose sight of historical accuracy\u201d (Alford, Com.).\n\n The Galilean accent differed from that of Jerusalem in being broader and more guttural ([Mark 14:70](/mark#Mark.14.70))."

It was famous also as being the birthplace or residence of Goliath ([1 Sam. 17:4](/1sam#1Sam.17.4)). David fled from Saul to Achish, king of Gath ([1 Sam. 21:10](/1sam#1Sam.21.10); [27:2-4](/1sam#1Sam.27.2); [Ps. 56](/ps#Ps.56)), and his connection with it will account for the words in [2 Sam. 1:20](/2sam#2Sam.1.20). It was afterwards conquered by David ([2 Sam. 8:1](/2sam#2Sam.8.1)). It occupied a strong position on the borders of Judah and Philistia ([1 Sam. 21:10](/1sam#1Sam.21.10); [1 Chr. 18:1](/1chr#1Chr.18.1)). Its site has been identified with the hill called Tell esSafieh, the Alba Specula of the Middle Ages, which rises 695 feet above the plain on its east edge. It is noticed on monuments about B.C. 1500."

It is one of the oldest cities of the world ( Genesis 10:19  ;  Joshua 15:47  ). Its earliest inhabitants were the Avims, who were conquered and displaced by the Caphtorims ( Deuteronomy 2:23  ;  Joshua 13:2  Joshua 13:3  ), a Philistine tribe. In the division of the land it fell to the lot of Judah ( Joshua 15:47  ;  Judges 1:18  ). It was the southernmost of the five great Philistine cities which gave each a golden emerod as a trespass-offering unto the Lord ( 1 Samuel 6:17  ). Its gates were carried away by Samson ( Judges 16:1-3  ). Here he was afterwards a prisoner, and \"did grind in the prison house.\" Here he also pulled down the temple of Dagon, and slew \"all the lords of the Philistines,\" himself also perishing in the ruin (Judg.  16:21-30  ). The prophets denounce the judgments of God against it ( Jeremiah 25:20  ;  47:5  ;  Amos 1:6  Amos 1:7  ;  Zephaniah 2:4  ). It is referred to in  Acts 8:26  . Philip is here told to take the road from Jerusalem to Gaza (about 6 miles south-west of Jerusalem), \"which is desert\", i.e., the \"desert road,\" probably by Hebron, through the desert hills of Southern Judea. (See SAMSON  .)   It is noticed on monuments as early as B.C. 1600. Its small port is now called el-Mineh.",

Its earliest inhabitants were the Avims, who were conquered and displaced by the Caphtorims ([Deut. 2:23](/deut#Deut.2.23); [Josh. 13:2](/josh#Josh.13.2), [3](/josh#Josh.13.3)), a Philistine tribe. In the division of the land it fell to the lot of Judah ([Josh. 15:47](/josh#Josh.15.47); [Judg. 1:18](/judg#Judg.1.18)). It was the southernmost of the five great Philistine cities which gave each a golden emerod as a trespass-offering unto the Lord ([1 Sam. 6:17](/1sam#1Sam.6.17)). Its gates were carried away by Samson ([Judg. 16:1-3](/judg#Judg.16.1)). Here he was afterwards a prisoner, and \u201cdid grind in the prison house.\u201d Here he also pulled down the temple of Dagon, and slew \u201call the lords of the Philistines,\u201d himself also perishing in the ruin ([Judg. 16:21-30](/judg#Judg.16.21)). The prophets denounce the judgments of God against it ([Jer. 25:20](/jer#Jer.25.20); [47:5](/jer#Jer.47.5); [Amos 1:6](/amos#Amos.1.6), [7](/amos#Amos.1.7); [Zeph. 2:4](/zeph#Zeph.2.4)). It is referred to in [Acts 8:26](/acts#Acts.8.26). Philip is here told to take the road from Jerusalem to Gaza (about 6 miles south-west of Jerusalem), \u201cwhich is desert\u201d, i.e., the \u201cdesert road,\u201d probably by Hebron, through the desert hills of Southern Judea.\n\n It is noticed on monuments as early as B.C. 1600. Its small port is now called el-Mineh."

Abraham sojourned here, and perhaps Isaac was born in this place. Both of these patriarchs were guilty of the sin of here denying their wives, and both of them entered into a treaty with the king before they departed to Beersheba (21:23-34; 26). It seems to have been a rich pastoral country ([2 Chr. 14:12-18](/2chr#2Chr.14.12)). Isaac here reaped an hundred-fold, and was blessed of God ([Gen. 26:12](/gen#Gen.26.12)).

                "Oil-press, the name of an olive-yard at the foot of the Mount of Olives, to which Jesus was wont to retire ([Luke 22:39](/luke#Luke.22.39)) with his disciples, and which is specially memorable as being the scene of his agony ([Mark 14:32](/mark#Mark.14.32); [John 18:1](/john#John.18.1); [Luke 22:44](/luke#Luke.22.44)). The plot of ground pointed out as Gethsemane is now surrounded by a wall, and is laid out as a modern European flower-garden. It contains eight venerable olive-trees, the age of which cannot, however, be determined. The exact site of Gethsemane is still in question. Dr. Thomson (The Land and the Book) says: \u201cWhen I first came to Jerusalem, and for many years afterward, this plot of ground was open to all whenever they chose to come and meditate beneath its very old olivetrees. The Latins, however, have within the last few years succeeded in gaining sole possession, and have built a high wall around it...The Greeks have invented another site a little to the north of it...My own impression is that both are wrong. The position is too near the city, and so close to what must have always been the great thoroughfare eastward, that our Lord would scarcely have selected it for retirement on that dangerous and dismal night...I am inclined to place the garden in the secluded vale several hundred yards to the north-east of the present Gethsemane.\u201d"

It stood between the lower Beth-horon and the sea ([Josh. 16:3](/josh#Josh.16.3); [1 Kings 9:17](/1kgs#1Kgs.9.17)). It was the last point to which David pursued the Philistines ([2 Sam. 5:25](/2sam#2Sam.5.25); [1 Chr. 14:16](/1chr#1Chr.14.16)) after the battle of Baal-perazim. The Canaanites retained possession of it till the time of Solomon, when the king of Egypt took it and gave it to Solomon as a part of the dowry of the Egyptian princess whom he married ([1 Kings 9:15-17](/1kgs#1Kgs.9.15)). It is identified with Tell el-Jezer, about 10 miles south-west of Beth-horon. It is mentioned in the Amarna tablets."

                "Hill-city, \u201cone of the royal cities, greater than Ai, and all the men thereof were mighty\u201d ([Josh. 10:2](/josh#Josh.10.2)). Its inhabitants were Hivites (11:19). It lay within the territory of Benjamin, and became a priest-city (18:25; 21:17). Here the tabernacle was set up after the destruction of Nob, and here it remained many years till the temple was built by Solomon. It is represented by the modern el-Jib, to the south-west of Ai, and about 5 1/2 miles north-north-west of Jerusalem.\n\n A deputation of the Gibeonites, with their allies from three other cities ([Josh. 9](/josh#Josh.9);[17](/josh#Josh.17)), visited the camp at Gilgal, and by false representations induced Joshua to enter into a league with them, although the Israelites had been specially warned against any league with the inhabitants of Canaan ([Ex. 23:32](/exod#Exod.23.32); [34:12](/exod#Exod.34.12); [Num. 33:55](/num#Num.33.55); [Deut. 7:2](/deut#Deut.7.2)). The deception practised on Joshua was detected three days later; but the oath rashly sworn \u201cby Jehovah God of Israel\u201d was kept, and the lives of the Gibeonites were spared. They were, however, made \u201cbondmen\u201d to the sanctuary ([Josh. 9:23](/josh#Josh.9.23)).\n\n The most remarkable incident connected with this city was the victory Joshua gained over the kings of Palestine ([Josh. 10:16-27](/josh#Josh.10.16)). The battle here fought has been regarded as \u201cone of the most important in the history of the world.\u201d The kings of southern Canaan entered into a confederacy against Gibeon (because it had entered into a league with Joshua) under the leadership of Adoni-zedec, king of Jerusalem, and marched upon Gibeon with the view of taking possession of it. The Gibeonites entreated Joshua to come to their aid with the utmost speed. His army came suddenly upon that of the Amorite kings as it lay encamped before the city. It was completely routed, and only broken remnants of their great host found refuge in the fenced cities. The five confederate kings who led the army were taken prisoners, and put to death at Makkedah (q.v.). This eventful battle of Beth-horon sealed the fate of all the cities of Southern Palestine. Among the Amarna tablets is a letter from Adoni-zedec (q.v.) to the king of Egypt, written probably at Makkedah after the defeat, showing that the kings contemplated flight into Egypt.\n\n This place is again brought into notice as the scene of a battle between the army of Ish-bosheth under Abner and that of David led by Joab. At the suggestion of Abner, to spare the effusion of blood twelve men on either side were chosen to decide the battle. The issue was unexpected; for each of the men slew his fellow, and thus they all perished. The two armies then engaged in battle, in which Abner and his host were routed and put to flight ([2 Sam. 2:12-17](/2sam#2Sam.2.12)). This battle led to a virtual truce between Judah and Israel, Judah, under David, increasing in power; and Israel, under Ish-bosheth, continually losing ground.\n\n Soon after the death of Absalom and David\u2019s restoration to his throne his kingdom was visited by a grievous famine, which was found to be a punishment for Saul\u2019s violation ([2 Sam. 21:2](/2sam#2Sam.21.2), [5](/2sam#2Sam.21.5)) of the covenant with the Gibeonites ([Josh. 9:3-27](/josh#Josh.9.3)). The Gibeonites demanded blood for the wrong that had been done to them, and accordingly David gave up to them the two sons of Rizpah (q.v.) and the five sons of Michal, and these the Gibeonites took and hanged or crucified \u201cin the hill before the Lord\u201d ([2 Sam. 21:9](/2sam#2Sam.21.9)); and there the bodies hung for six months (21:10), and all the while Rizpah watched over the blackening corpses and \u201csuffered neither the birds of the air to rest on them by day, nor the beasts of the field by night.\u201d David afterwards removed the bones of Saul and Jonathan at Jabeshgilead (21:12, 13).\n\n Here, \u201cat the great stone,\u201d Amasa was put to death by Joab ([2 Sam. 20:5-10](/2sam#2Sam.20.5)). To the altar of burnt-offering which was at Gibeon, Joab ([1 Kings 2:28-34](/1kgs#1Kgs.2.28)), who had taken the side of Adonijah, fled for sanctuary in the beginning of Solomon\u2019s reign, and was there also slain by the hand of Benaiah.\n\n Soon after he came to the throne, Solomon paid a visit of state to Gibeon, there to offer sacrifices ([1 Kings 3:4](/1kgs#1Kgs.3.4); [2 Chr. 1:3](/2chr#2Chr.1.3)). On this occasion the Lord appeared to him in a memorable dream, recorded in [1 Kings 3:5-15](/1kgs#1Kgs.3.5); [2 Chr. 1:7-12](/2chr#2Chr.1.7). When the temple was built \u201call the men of Israel assembled themselves\u201d to king Solomon, and brought up from Gibeon the tabernacle and \u201call the holy vessels that were in the tabernacle\u201d to Jerusalem, where they remained till they were carried away by Nebuchadnezzar ([2 Kings 24:13](/2kgs#2Kgs.24.13))."

                "The only natural spring of water in or near Jerusalem is the \u201cFountain of the Virgin\u201d (q.v.), which rises outside the city walls on the west bank of the Kidron valley. On the occasion of the approach of the Assyrian army under Sennacherib, Hezekiah, in order to prevent the besiegers from finding water, \u201cstopped the upper water course of Gihon, and brought it straight down to the west side of the city of David\u201d ([2 Chr. 32:30](/2chr#2Chr.32.30); [33:14](/2chr#2Chr.33.14)). This \u201cfountain\u201d or spring is therefore to be regarded as the \u201cupper water course of Gihon.\u201d From this \u201cfountain\u201d a tunnel cut through the ridge which forms the south part of the temple hill conveys the water to the Pool of Siloam, which lies on the opposite side of this ridge at the head of the Tyropoeon (\u201ccheesemakers\u2019\u201d) valley, or valley of the son of Hinnom, now filled up by rubbish. The length of this tunnel is about 1,750 feet. In 1880 an inscription was accidentally discovered on the wall of the tunnel about nineteen feet from where it opens into the Pool of Siloam. This inscription was executed in all probability by Hezekiah\u2019s workmen. It briefly narrates the history of the excavation. It may, however, be possible that this tunnel was executed in the time of Solomon. If the \u201cwaters of Shiloah that go softly\u201d ([Isa. 8:6](/isa#Isa.8.6)) refers to the gentle stream that still flows through the tunnel into the Pool of Siloam, then this excavation must have existed before the time of Hezekiah.\n\n In the upper part of the Tyropoeoan valley there are two pools still existing, the first, called Birket el-Mamilla, to the west of the Jaffa gate; the second, to the south of the first, called Birket es-Sultan. It is the opinion of some that the former was the \u201cupper\u201d and the latter the \u201clower\u201d Pool of Gihon ([2 Kings 18:17](/2kgs#2Kgs.18.17); [Isa. 7:3](/isa#Isa.7.3); [36:2](/isa#Isa.36.2); [22:9](/isa#Isa.22.9))."

It is called also \u201cthe land of Gilead\u201d ([Num. 32:1](/num#Num.32.1)), and sometimes simply \u201cGilead\u201d ([Ps. 60:7](/ps#Ps.60.7); [Gen. 37:25](/gen#Gen.37.25)). It comprised the possessions of the tribes of Gad and Reuben and the south part of Manasseh ([Deut. 3:13](/deut#Deut.3.13); [Num. 32:40](/num#Num.32.40)). It was bounded on the north by Bashan, and on the south by Moab and Ammon ([Gen. 31:21](/gen#Gen.31.21); [Deut. 3:12-17](/deut#Deut.3.12)). \u201cHalf Gilead\u201d was possessed by Sihon, and the other half, separated from it by the river Jabbok, by Og, king of Bashan. The deep ravine of the river Hieromax (the modern Sheriat el-Mandhur) separated Bashan from Gilead, which was about 60 miles in length and 20 in breadth, extending from near the south end of the Lake of Gennesaret to the north end of the Dead Sea. Abarim, Pisgah, Nebo, and Peor are its mountains mentioned in Scripture."

It was \u201cbeside the oaks of Moreh,\u201d near which Abraham erected his first altar ([Gen. 12:6](/gen#Gen.12.6), [7](/gen#Gen.12.7)). This was one of the three towns to which Samuel resorted for the administration of justice ([1 Sam. 7:16](/1sam#1Sam.7.16)), and here also he offered sacrifices when the ark was no longer in the tabernacle at Shiloh ([1 Sam. 10:8](/1sam#1Sam.10.8); [13:7-9](/1sam#1Sam.13.7)). To this place, as to a central sanctuary, all Israel gathered to renew their allegiance to Saul (11:14). At a later period it became the scene of idolatrous worship ([Hos. 4:15](/hos#Hos.4.15); [9:15](/hos#Hos.9.15)). It has been identified with the ruins of Jiljilieh, about 5 miles south-west of Shiloh and about the same distance from Bethel."

                "The name of the leader of the hostile party described in [Ezek. 38](/ezek#Ezek.38), [39](/ezek#Ezek.39), as coming from the \u201cnorth country\u201d and assailing the people of Israel to their own destruction. This prophecy has been regarded as fulfilled in the conflicts of the Maccabees with Antiochus, the invasion and overthrow of the Chaldeans, and the temporary successes and destined overthrow of the Turks. But \u201call these interpretations are unsatisfactory and inadequate. The vision respecting Gog and Magog in the Apocalypse ([Rev. 20:8](/rev#Rev.20.8)) is in substance a reannouncement of this prophecy of Ezekiel. But while Ezekiel contemplates the great conflict in a more general light as what was certainly to be connected with the times of the Messiah, and should come then to its last decisive issues, John, on the other hand, writing from the commencement of the Messiah\u2019s times, describes there the last struggles and victories of the cause of Christ. In both cases alike the vision describes the final workings of the world\u2019s evil and its results in connection with the kingdom of God, only the starting-point is placed further in advance in the one case than in the other.\u201d\n\n It has been supposed to be the name of a district in the wild north-east steppes of Central Asia, north of the Hindu-Kush, now a part of Turkestan, a region about 2,000 miles north-east of Nineveh."

It was a little knoll rounded like a bare skull. It is obvious from the evangelists that it was some well-known spot outside the gate (comp. [Heb. 13:12](/heb#Heb.13.12)), and near the city ([Luke 23:26](/luke#Luke.23.26)), containing a \u201cgarden\u201d ([John 19:41](/john#John.19.41)), and on a thoroughfare leading into the country. Hence it is an untenable idea that it is embraced within the present \u201cChurch of the Holy Sepulchre.\u201d The hillock above Jeremiah\u2019s Grotto, to the north of the city, is in all probability the true site of Calvary. The skull-like appearance of the rock in the southern precipice of the hillock is very remarkable."

Their destruction is mentioned as an \u201censample unto those that after should live ungodly\u201d (2 Pet. 2:6; [Jude 1](/jude#Jude.1.1):4-7). Their wickedness became proverbial ([Deut. 32:32](/deut#Deut.32.32); [Isa. 1:9](/isa#Isa.1.9), [10](/isa#Isa.1.10); [Jer. 23:14](/jer#Jer.23.14)).

After his reconciliation with Saul at Engedi (24:1-8), David returned to Hachilah, where he had fixed his quarters. The Ziphites treacherously informed Saul of this, and he immediately (26:1-4) renewed his pursuit of David, and \u201cpitched in the hill of Hachilah.\u201d David and his nephew Abishai stole at night into the midst of Saul\u2019s camp, when they were all asleep, and noiselessly removed the royal spear and the cruse from the side of the king, and then, crossing the intervening valley to the height on the other side, David cried to the people, and thus awoke the sleepers. He then addressed Saul, who recognized his voice, and expostulated with him. Saul professed to be penitent; but David could not put confidence in him, and he now sought refuge at Ziklag. David and Saul never afterwards met. ([1 Sam. 26:13-25](/1sam#1Sam.26.13))."

                "Fortress, the capital of one of the kingdoms of Upper Syria of the same name, on the Orontes, in the valley of Lebanon, at the northern boundary of Palestine ([Num. 13:21](/num#Num.13.21); [34:8](/num#Num.34.8)), at the foot of Hermon ([Josh. 13:5](/josh#Josh.13.5)) towards Damascus ([Zech. 9:2](/zech#Zech.9.2); [Jer. 49:23](/jer#Jer.49.23)). It is called \u201cHamath the great\u201d in [Amos 6:2](/amos#Amos.6.2), and \u201cHamath-zobah\u201d in [2 Chr. 8:3](/2chr#2Chr.8.3).\n\n Hamath, now Hamah, had an Aramaean population, but Hittite monuments discovered there show that it must have been at one time occupied by the Hittites. It was among the conquests of the Pharaoh Thothmes III. Its king, Tou or Toi, made alliance with David ([2 Sam. 8:10](/2sam#2Sam.8.10)), and in B.C. 740 Azariah formed a league with it against Assyria. It was, however, conquered by the Assyrians, and its nineteen districts placed under Assyrian governors. In B.C. 720 it revolted under a certain Yahu-bihdi, whose name, compounded with that of the God of Israel (Yahu), perhaps shows that he was of Jewish origin. But the revolt was suppressed, and the people of Hamath were transported to Samaria ([2 Kings 17:24](/2kgs#2Kgs.17.24), [30](/2kgs#2Kgs.17.30)), where they continued to worship their god Ashima. Hamah is beautifully situated on the Orontes, 32 miles north of Emesa, and 36 south of the ruins of Assamea.\n\n The kingdom of Hamath comprehended the great plain lying on both banks of the Orontes from the fountain near Riblah to Assamea on the north, and from Lebanon on the west to the desert on the east. The \u201centrance of Hamath\u201d ([Num. 34:8](/num#Num.34.8)), which was the north boundary of Palestine, led from the west between the north end of Lebanon and the Nusairiyeh mountains."

It stood on the river Belik, an affluent of the Euphrates, about 70 miles above where it joins that river in Upper Mesopotamia or Padan-aram, and about 600 miles northwest of Ur in a direct line. It was on the caravan route between the east and west. It is afterwards mentioned among the towns taken by the king of Assyria ([2 Kings 19:12](/2kgs#2Kgs.19.12); [Isa. 37:12](/isa#Isa.37.12)).

Such like enclosures abound in the wilderness of Paran, which the Israelites entered after leaving Sinai ([Num. 11:35](/num#Num.11.35); [12:16](/num#Num.12.16); [33:17](/num#Num.33.17), [18](/num#Num.33.18)). This third encampment of the Israelites has been identified with the modern \u2018Ain el-Hudhera, some 40 miles north-east of Sinai. Here Miriam (q.v.), being displeased that Moses had married a Cushite wife ([Num. 12:1](/num#Num.12.1)), induced Aaron to join with her in rebelling against Moses. God vindicated the authority of his \u201cservant Moses,\u201d and Miriam was smitten with leprosy. Moses interceded for her, and she was healed ([Num. 12:4-16](/num#Num.12.4)). From this encampment the Israelites marched northward across the plateau of et-Tih, and at length reached KADESH."

                "A stronghold of the Canaanites in the mountains north of Lake Merom ([Josh. 11:1-5](/josh#Josh.11.1)). Jabin the king with his allied tribes here encountered Joshua in a great battle. Joshua gained a signal victory, which virtually completed his conquest of Canaan (11:10-13). This city was, however, afterwards rebuilt by the Canaanites, and was ruled by a king with the same hereditary name of Jabin. His army, under a noted leader of the name of Sisera, swept down upon the south, aiming at the complete subjugation of the country. This powerful army was met by the Israelites under Barak, who went forth by the advice of the prophetess Deborah. The result was one of the most remarkable victories for Israel recorded in the Old Testament ([Josh. 19:36](/josh#Josh.19.36); [Judg. 4:2](/judg#Judg.4.2); [1 Sam. 12:9](/1sam#1Sam.12.9)). The city of Hazor was taken and occupied by the Israelites. It was fortified by Solomon to defend the entrance into the kingdom from Syria and Assyria. When Tiglath-pileser, the Assyrian king, invaded the land, this was one of the first cities he captured, carrying its inhabitants captive into Assyria ([2 Kings 15:29](/2kgs#2Kgs.15.29)). It has been identified with Khurbet Harrah, 2 1/2 miles south-east of Kedesh."

                "A city in the south end of the valley of Eshcol, about midway between Jerusalem and Beersheba, from which it is distant about 20 miles in a straight line. It was built \u201cseven years before Zoan in Egypt\u201d ([Gen. 13:18](/gen#Gen.13.18); [Num. 13:22](/num#Num.13.22)). It still exists under the same name, and is one of the most ancient cities in the world. Its earlier name was Kirjath-arba ([Gen. 23:2](/gen#Gen.23.2); [Josh. 14:15](/josh#Josh.14.15); [15:3](/josh#Josh.15.3)). But \u201cHebron would appear to have been the original name of the city, and it was not till after Abraham\u2019s stay there that it received the name Kirjath-arba, who [i.e., Arba] was not the founder but the conqueror of the city, having led thither the tribe of the Anakim, to which he belonged. It retained this name till it came into the possession of Caleb, when the Israelites restored the original name Hebron\u201d (Keil, Com.). The name of this city does not occur in any of the prophets or in the New Testament. It is found about forty times in the Old. It was the favorite home of Abraham. Here he pitched his tent under the oaks of Mamre, by which name it came afterwards to be known; and here Sarah died, and was buried in the cave of Machpelah ([Gen. 23:17-20](/gen#Gen.23.17)), which he bought from Ephron the Hittite. From this place the patriarch departed for Egypt by way of Beersheba (37:14; 46:1). It was taken by Joshua and given to Caleb ([Josh. 10:36](/josh#Josh.10.36), [37](/josh#Josh.10.37); 12:10; 14:13). It became a Levitical city and a city of refuge (20:7; 21:11). When David became king of Judah this was his royal residence, and he resided here for seven and a half years ([2 Sam. 5:5](/2sam#2Sam.5.5)); and here he was anointed as king over all Israel ([2 Sam. 2:1-4](/2sam#2Sam.2.1), [11](/2sam#2Sam.2.11); [1 Kings 2:11](/1kgs#1Kgs.2.11)). It became the residence also of the rebellious Absalom ([2 Sam. 15:10](/2sam#2Sam.15.10)), who probably expected to find his chief support in the tribe of Judah, now called el-Khulil.\n\n In one part of the modern city is a great mosque, which is built over the grave of Machpelah. The first European who was permitted to enter this mosque was the Prince of Wales in 1862. It was also visited by the Marquis of Bute in 1866, and by the late Emperor Frederick of Germany (then Crown-Prince of Prussia) in 1869.\n\n One of the largest oaks in Palestine is found in the valley of Eshcol, about 3 miles north of the town. It is supposed by some to be the tree under which Abraham pitched his tent, and is called \u201cAbraham\u2019s oak.\u201d"

                "Plot of the sharp blades, or the field of heroes, ([2 Sam. 2:16](/2sam#2Sam.2.16)). After the battle of Gilboa, so fatal to Saul and his house, David, as divinely directed, took up his residence in Hebron, and was there anointed king over Judah. Among the fugitives from Gilboa was Ish-bosheth, the only surviving son of Saul, whom Abner, Saul\u2019s uncle, took across the Jordan to Mahanaim, and there had him proclaimed king. Abner gathered all the forces at his command and marched to Gibeon, with the object of wresting Judah from David. Joab had the command of David\u2019s army of trained men, who encamped on the south of the pool, which was on the east of the hill on which the town of Gibeon was built, while Abner\u2019s army lay on the north of the pool. Abner proposed that the conflict should be decided by twelve young men engaging in personal combat on either side. So fiercely did they encounter each other that \u201cthey caught every man his fellow by the head, and thrust his sword in his fellow\u2019s side; so they fell down together: wherefore that place was called Helkath-hazzurim.\u201d The combat of the champions was thus indecisive, and there followed a severe general engagement between the two armies, ending in the total rout of the Israelites under Abner. The general result of this battle was that \u201cDavid waxed stronger and stronger, and the house of Saul waxed weaker and weaker\u201d ([2 Sam. 3:1](/2sam#2Sam.3.1))."

It is about 40 miles north of the Sea of Galilee. It is called \u201cthe Hermonites\u201d ([Ps. 42:6](/ps#Ps.42.6)) because it has more than one summit. The Sidonians called it Sirion, and the Amorites Shenir ([Deut. 3:9](/deut#Deut.3.9); [Cant. 4:8](/song#Song.4.8)). It is also called Baal-hermon ([Judg. 3:3](/judg#Judg.3.3); [1 Chr. 5:23](/1chr#1Chr.5.23)) and Sion ([Deut. 4:48](/deut#Deut.4.48)). There is every probability that one of its three summits was the scene of the transfiguration (q.v.). The \u201cdew of Hermon\u201d is referred to ([Ps. 89](/ps#Ps.89): 12). Its modern name is Jebel-esh-Sheikh, \u201cthe chief mountain.\u201d It is one of the most conspicuous mountains in Palestine or Syria. \u201cIn whatever part of Palestine the Israelite turned his eye northward, Hermon was there, terminating the view. From the plain along the coast, from the Jordan valley, from the heights of Moab and Gilead, from the plateau of Bashan, the pale, blue, snow-capped cone forms the one feature in the northern horizon.\u201d\n\n Our Lord and his disciples climbed this \u201chigh mountain apart\u201d one day, and remained on its summit all night, \u201cweary after their long and toilsome ascent.\u201d During the night \u201che was transfigured before them; and his face did shine as the sun.\u201d The next day they descended to Caesarea Philippi."

                "Banning; i.e., placing under a \u201cban,\u201d or devoting to utter destruction. After the manifestation of God\u2019s anger against the Israelites, on account of their rebellion and their murmurings when the spies returned to the camp at Kadesh, in the wilderness of Paran, with an evil report of the land, they quickly repented of their conduct, and presumed to go up \u201cto the head of the mountain,\u201d seeking to enter the Promised Land, but without the presence of the Lord, without the ark of the convenant, and without Moses. The Amalekites and the Canaanites came down and \u201csmote and discomfited them even unto Hormah\u201d ([Num. 14:45](/num#Num.14.45)). This place, or perhaps the watch-tower commanding it, was originally called Zephath ([Judg. 1:17](/judg#Judg.1.17)), the modern Sebaiteh. Afterwards ([Num. 21:1-3](/num#Num.21.1)) Arad, the king of the Canaanites, at the close of the wanderings, when the Israelites were a second time encamped at Kadesh, \u201cfought against them, and took some of them prisoners.\u201d But Israel vowed a vow unto the Lord utterly to destroy the cities of the Canaanites; they \u201cbanned\u201d them, and hence the place was now called Hormah. But this \u201cban\u201d was not fully executed till the time of Joshua, who finally conquered the king of this district, so that the ancient name Zephath became \u201cHormah\u201d ([Josh. 12:14](/josh#Josh.12.14); [Judg. 1:17](/judg#Judg.1.17))."

It rises on the eastern side of the mountains of Gilead, and runs a course of about 65 miles in a wild and deep ravine. It was the boundary between the territory of the Ammonites and that of Og, king of Bashan ([Josh. 12:1-5](/josh#Josh.12.1); [Num. 21:24](/num#Num.21.24)); also between the tribe of Reuben and the half tribe of Manasseh (21:24; [Deut. 3:16](/deut#Deut.3.16)). In its course westward across the plains it passes more than once underground. \u201cThe scenery along its banks is probably the most picturesque in Palestine; and the ruins of town and village and fortress which stud the surrounding mountain-side render the country as interesting as it is beautiful.\u201d This river is now called the Zerka, or blue river."

                "A town on the east of Jordan, on the top of one of the green hills of Gilead, within the limits of the half tribe of Manasseh, and in full view of Beth-shan. It is first mentioned in connection with the vengeance taken on its inhabitants because they had refused to come up to Mizpeh to take part with Israel against the tribe of Benjamin ([Judg. 21:8-14](/judg#Judg.21.8)). After the battles at Gibeah, that tribe was almost extinguished, only six hundred men remaining. An expedition went against Jabesh-Gilead, the whole of whose inhabitants were put to the sword, except four hundred maidens, whom they brought as prisoners and sent to \u201cproclaim peace\u201d to the Benjamites who had fled to the crag Rimmon. These captives were given to them as wives, that the tribe might be saved from extinction ([Judg. 21](/judg#Judg.21)).\n\n This city was afterwards taken by Nahash, king of the Ammonites, but was delivered by Saul, the newly-elected king of Israel. In gratitude for this deliverance, forty years after this, the men of Jabesh-Gilead took down the bodies of Saul and of his three sons from the walls of Beth-shan, and after burning them, buried the bones under a tree near the city ([1 Sam. 31:11-13](/1sam#1Sam.31.11)). David thanked them for this act of piety ([2 Sam. 2:4-6](/2sam#2Sam.2.4)), and afterwards transferred the remains to the royal sepulchre (21:14). It is identified with the ruins of ed-Deir, about 6 miles south of Pella, on the north of the Wady Yabis."

It was the key to Western Palestine.\n\n This city was taken in a very remarkable manner by the Israelites ([Josh. 6](/josh#Josh.6)). God gave it into their hands. The city was \u201caccursed\u201d (Heb. herem, \u201cdevoted\u201d to Jehovah), and accordingly ([Josh. 6:17](/josh#Josh.6.17); comp. [Lev. 27:28](/lev#Lev.27.28), [29](/lev#Lev.27.29); [Deut. 13:16](/deut#Deut.13.16)) all the inhabitants and all the spoil of the city were to be destroyed, \u201conly the silver, and the gold, and the vessels of brass and of iron\u201d were reserved and \u201cput into the treasury of the house of Jehovah\u201d ([Josh. 6:24](/josh#Josh.6.24); comp. [Num. 31:22](/num#Num.31.22), [23](/num#Num.31.23), [50](/num#Num.31.50)-54). Only Rahab \u201cand her father\u2019s household, and all that she had,\u201d were preserved from destruction, according to the promise of the spies ([Josh. 2:14](/josh#Josh.2.14)). In one of the Amarna tablets Adoni-zedec (q.v.) writes to the king of Egypt informing him that the \u2018Abiri (Hebrews) had prevailed, and had taken the fortress of Jericho, and were plundering \u201call the king\u2019s lands.\u201d It would seem that the Egyptian troops had before this been withdrawn from Palestine.\n\n This city was given to the tribe of Benjamin ([Josh. 18:21](/josh#Josh.18.21)), and it was inhabited in the time of the Judges ([Judg. 3:13](/judg#Judg.3.13); [2 Sam. 10:5](/2sam#2Sam.10.5)). It is not again mentioned till the time of David ([2 Sam. 10:5](/2sam#2Sam.10.5)). \u201cChildren of Jericho\u201d were among the captives who returned under Zerubbabel [Ezra 2:34](/ezra#Ezra.2.34); [Neh. 7:36](/neh#Neh.7.36)). Hiel (q.v.) the Bethelite attempted to make it once more a fortified city ([1 Kings 16:34](/1kgs#1Kgs.16.34)). Between the beginning and the end of his undertaking all his children were cut off.\n\n In New Testament times Jericho stood some distance to the south-east of the ancient one, and near the opening of the valley of Achor. It was a rich and flourishing town, having a considerable trade, and celebrated for the palm trees which adorned the plain around. It was visited by our Lord on his last journey to Jerusalem. Here he gave sight to two blind men ([Matt. 20:29-34](/matt#Matt.20.29); [Mark 10:46-52](/mark#Mark.10.46)), and brought salvation to the house of Zacchaeus the publican ([Luke 19:2-10](/luke#Luke.19.2)).\n\n The poor hamlet of er-Riha, the representative of modern Jericho, is situated some two miles farther to the east. It is in a ruinous condition, having been destroyed by the Turks in 1840. \u201cThe soil of the plain,\u201d about the middle of which the ancient city stood, \u201cis unsurpassed in fertility; there is abundance of water for irrigation, and many of the old aqueducts are almost perfect; yet nearly the whole plain is waste and desolate...The climate of Jericho is exceedingly hot and unhealthy. This is accounted for by the depression of the plain, which is about 1,200 feet below the level of the sea.\u201d\n\n There were three different Jerichos, on three different sites, the Jericho of Joshua, the Jericho of Herod, and the Jericho of the Crusades. Er-Riha, the modern Jericho, dates from the time of the Crusades. Dr. Bliss has found in a hollow scooped out for some purpose or other near the foot of the biggest mound above the Sultan\u2019s Spring specimens of Amorite or pre-Israelitish pottery precisely identical with what he had discovered on the site of ancient Lachish. He also traced in this place for a short distance a mud brick wall in situ, which he supposes to be the very wall that fell before the trumpets of Joshua. The wall is not far from the foot of the great precipice of Quarantania and its numerous caverns, and the spies of Joshua could easily have fled from the city and been speedily hidden in these fastnesses."

            "dictionaryText": " called also Salem, Ariel, Jebus, the \"city of God,\" the \"holy city;\" by the modern Arabs el-Khuds, meaning \"the holy;\" once \"the city of Judah\" ( 2 Chronicles 25:28  ). This name is in the original in the dual form, and means \"possession of peace,\" or \"foundation of peace.\" The dual form probably refers to the two mountains on which it was built, viz., Zion and Moriah; or, as some suppose, to the two parts of the city, the \"upper\" and the \"lower city.\" Jerusalem is a \"mountain city enthroned on a mountain fastness\" (Compare  Psalms 68:15  Psalms 68:16  ;  87:1  ;  125:2  ;  Psalms 76:1  Psalms 76:2  ;  122:3  ). It stands on the edge of one of the highest table-lands in Palestine, and is surrounded on the south-eastern, the southern, and the western sides by deep and precipitous ravines.    It is first mentioned in Scripture under the name Salem ( Genesis 14:18  ; Compare  Psalms 76:2  ). When first mentioned under the name Jerusalem, Adonizedek was its king ( Joshua 10:1  ). It is afterwards named among the cities of Benjamin ( Judges 19:10  ;  1 Chronicles 11:4  ); but in the time of David it was divided between Benjamin and Judah. After the death of Joshua the city was taken and set on fire by the men of Judah ( Judges 1:1-8  ); but the Jebusites were not wholly driven out of it. The city is not again mentioned till we are told that David brought the head of Goliath thither ( 1 Samuel 17:54  ). David afterwards led his forces against the Jebusites still residing within its walls, and drove them out, fixing his own dwelling on Zion, which he called \"the city of David\" ( 2 Samuel 5:5-9  ;  1 Chronicles 11:4-8  ). Here he built an altar to the Lord on the threshing-floor of Araunah the Jebusite ( 2 Samuel 24:15-25  ), and thither he brought up the ark of the covenant and placed it in the new tabernacle which he had prepared for it. Jerusalem now became the capital of the kingdom.    After the death of David, Solomon built the temple, a house for the name of the Lord, on Mount Moriah (B.C. 1010). He also greatly strengthened and adorned the city, and it became the great centre of all the civil and religious affairs of the nation ( Deuteronomy 12:5  ; comp  12:14  ;  14:23  ;  16:11-16  ;  Psalms 122  ).    After the disruption of the kingdom on the accession to the throne of Rehoboam, the son of Solomon, Jerusalem became the capital of the kingdom of the two tribes. It was subsequently often taken and retaken by the Egyptians, the Assyrians, and by the kings of Israel ( 2 Kings 14:13  2 Kings 14:14  ;  2 Kings 18:15  2 Kings 18:16  ;  23:33-35  ;  24:14  ;  2  Chr  12:9  ;   26:9  ;   2 Kings 27:3   2 Kings 27:4  ;   29:3  ;   32:30  ;   33:11  ), till finally, for the abounding iniquities of the nation, after a siege of three years, it was taken and utterly destroyed, its walls razed to the ground, and its temple and palaces consumed by fire, by Nebuchadnezzar, the king of Babylon ( 2 Kings 25  ;  2  Chr.   36  ;  Jeremiah 39  ), B.C. 588. The desolation of the city and the land was completed by the retreat of the principal Jews into Egypt (  Jeremiah 4044  -44), and by the final carrying captive into Babylon of all that still remained in the land ( 52:3  ), so that it was left without an inhabitant (B.C. 582). Compare the predictions,  Deuteronomy 28  ;  Leviticus 26:14-39  .    But the streets and walls of Jerusalem were again to be built, in troublous times ( Daniel 9:16  Daniel 9:19  Daniel 9:25  ), after a captivity of seventy years. This restoration was begun B.C. 536, \"in the first year of Cyrus\" ( Ezra 1:2  Ezra 1:3  Ezra 1:5-11  ). The Books of Ezra and Nehemiah contain the history of the re-building of the city and temple, and the restoration of the kingdom of the Jews, consisting of a portion of all the tribes. The kingdom thus constituted was for two centuries under the dominion of Persia, till B.C. 331; and thereafter, for about a century and a half, under the rulers of the Greek empire in Asia, till B.C. 167. For a century the Jews maintained their independence under native rulers, the Asmonean princes. At the close of this period they fell under the rule of Herod and of members of his family, but practically under Rome, till the time of the destruction of Jerusalem, A.D. 70. The city was then laid in ruins.    The modern Jerusalem by-and-by began to be built over the immense beds of rubbish resulting from the overthrow of the ancient city; and whilst it occupies certainly the same site, there are no evidences that even the lines of its streets are now what they were in the ancient city. Till A.D. 131 the Jews who still lingered about Jerusalem quietly submitted to the Roman sway. But in that year the emperor (Hadrian), in order to hold them in subjection, rebuilt and fortified the city. The Jews, however, took possession of it, having risen under the leadership of one Bar-Chohaba (i.e., \"the son of the star\") in revolt against the Romans. Some four years afterwards (A.D. 135), however, they were driven out of it with great slaughter, and the city was again destroyed; and over its ruins was built a Roman city called Aelia Capitolina, a name which it retained till it fell under the dominion of the Mohammedans, when it was called el-Khuds, i.e., \"the holy.\"    In A.D. 326 Helena, mother of the emperor Constantine, made a pilgrimage to Jerusalem with the view of discovering the places mentioned in the life of our Lord. She caused a church to be built on what was then supposed to be the place of the nativity at Bethlehem. Constantine, animated by her example, searched for the holy sepulchre, and built over the supposed site a magnificent church, which was completed and dedicated A.D. 335. He relaxed the laws against the Jews till this time in force, and permitted them once a year to visit the city and wail over the desolation of \"the holy and beautiful house.\"    In A.D. 614 the Persians, after defeating the Roman forces of the emperor Heraclius, took Jerusalem by storm, and retained it till A.D. 637, when it was taken by the Arabians under the Khalif Omar. It remained in their possession till it passed, in A.D. 960, under the dominion of the Fatimite khalifs of Egypt, and in A.D. 1073 under the Turcomans. In A.D. 1099 the crusader Godfrey of Bouillon took the city from the Moslems with great slaughter, and was elected king of Jerusalem. He converted the Mosque of Omar into a Christian cathedral. During the eighty-eight years which followed, many churches and convents were erected in the holy city. The Church of the Holy Sepulchre was rebuilt during this period, and it alone remains to this day. In A.D. 1187 the sultan Saladin wrested the city from the Christians. From that time to the present day, with few intervals, Jerusalem has remained in the hands of the Moslems. It has, however, during that period been again and again taken and retaken, demolished in great part and rebuilt, no city in the world having passed through so many vicissitudes.    In the year 1850 the Greek and Latin monks residing in Jerusalem had a fierce dispute about the guardianship of what are called the \"holy places.\" In this dispute the emperor Nicholas of Russia sided with the Greeks, and Louis Napoleon, the emperor of the French, with the Latins. This led the Turkish authorities to settle the question in a way unsatisfactory to Russia. Out of this there sprang the Crimean War, which was protracted and sanguinary, but which had important consequences in the way of breaking down the barriers of Turkish exclusiveness.    Modern Jerusalem \"lies near the summit of a broad mountain-ridge, which extends without interruption from the plain of Esdraelon to a line drawn between the southern end of the Dead Sea and the southeastern corner of the Mediterranean.\" This high, uneven table-land is everywhere from 20 to 25 geographical miles in breadth. It was anciently known as the mountains of Ephraim and Judah.    \"Jerusalem is a city of contrasts, and differs widely from Damascus, not merely because it is a stone town in mountains, whilst the latter is a mud city in a plain, but because while in Damascus Moslem religion and Oriental custom are unmixed with any foreign element, in Jerusalem every form of religion, every nationality of East and West, is represented at one time.\"   Jerusalem is first mentioned under that name in the Book of Joshua, and the Tell-el-Amarna collection of tablets includes six letters from its Amorite king to Egypt, recording the attack of the Abiri about B.C. 1480. The name is there spelt Uru-Salim (\"city of peace\"). Another monumental record in which the Holy City is named is that of Sennacherib's attack in B.C. 702. The \"camp of the Assyrians\" was still shown about A.D. 70, on the flat ground to the north-west, included in the new quarter of the city.    The city of David included both the upper city and Millo, and was surrounded by a wall built by David and Solomon, who appear to have restored the original Jebusite fortifications. The name Zion (or Sion) appears to have been, like Ariel (\"the hearth of God\"), a poetical term for Jerusalem, but in the Greek age was more specially used of the Temple hill. The priests' quarter grew up on Ophel, south of the Temple, where also was Solomon's Palace outside the original city of David. The walls of the city were extended by Jotham and Manasseh to include this suburb and the Temple ( 2 Chronicles 27:3  ;  33:14  ).    Jerusalem is now a town of some 50,000 inhabitants, with ancient mediaeval walls, partly on the old lines, but extending less far to the south. The traditional sites, as a rule, were first shown in the 4th and later centuries A.D., and have no authority. The results of excavation have, however, settled most of the disputed questions, the limits of the Temple area, and the course of the old walls having been traced. ",

                "Called also Salem, Ariel, Jebus, the \u201ccity of God,\u201d the \u201choly city;\u201d by the modern Arabs el-Khuds, meaning \u201cthe holy;\u201d once \u201cthe city of Judah\u201d ([2 Chr. 25:28](/2chr#2Chr.25.28)). This name is in the original in the dual form, and means \u201cpossession of peace,\u201d or \u201cfoundation of peace.\u201d The dual form probably refers to the two mountains on which it was built, viz., Zion and Moriah; or, as some suppose, to the two parts of the city, the \u201cupper\u201d and the \u201clower city.\u201d Jerusalem is a \u201cmountain city enthroned on a mountain fastness\u201d (comp. [Ps. 68:15](/ps#Ps.68.15), [16](/ps#Ps.68.16); 87:1; 125:2; 76:1, 2; 122:3). It stands on the edge of one of the highest table-lands in Palestine, and is surrounded on the south-eastern, the southern, and the western sides by deep and precipitous ravines.\n\n It is first mentioned in Scripture under the name Salem ([Gen. 14:18](/gen#Gen.14.18); comp. [Ps. 76:2](/ps#Ps.76.2)). When first mentioned under the name Jerusalem, Adonizedek was its king ([Josh. 10:1](/josh#Josh.10.1)). It is afterwards named among the cities of Benjamin ([Judg. 19:10](/judg#Judg.19.10); [1 Chr. 11:4](/1chr#1Chr.11.4)); but in the time of David it was divided between Benjamin and Judah. After the death of Joshua the city was taken and set on fire by the men of Judah ([Judg. 1:1-8](/judg#Judg.1.1)); but the Jebusites were not wholly driven out of it. The city is not again mentioned till we are told that David brought the head of Goliath thither ([1 Sam. 17:54](/1sam#1Sam.17.54)). David afterwards led his forces against the Jebusites still residing within its walls, and drove them out, fixing his own dwelling on Zion, which he called \u201cthe city of David\u201d ([2 Sam. 5:5-9](/2sam#2Sam.5.5); [1 Chr. 11:4-8](/1chr#1Chr.11.4)). Here he built an altar to the Lord on the threshing-floor of Araunah the Jebusite ([2 Sam. 24:15-25](/2sam#2Sam.24.15)), and thither he brought up the ark of the covenant and placed it in the new tabernacle which he had prepared for it. Jerusalem now became the capital of the kingdom.\n\n After the death of David, Solomon built the temple, a house for the name of the Lord, on Mount Moriah (B.C. 1010). He also greatly strengthened and adorned the city, and it became the great centre of all the civil and religious affairs of the nation ([Deut. 12:5](/deut#Deut.12.5); comp. 12:14; 14:23; 16:11-16; [Ps. 122](/ps#Ps.122)).\n\n After the disruption of the kingdom on the accession to the throne of Rehoboam, the son of Solomon, Jerusalem became the capital of the kingdom of the two tribes. It was subsequently often taken and retaken by the Egyptians, the Assyrians, and by the kings of Israel ([2 Kings 14:13](/2kgs#2Kgs.14.13), [14](/2kgs#2Kgs.14.14); 18:15, 16; 23:33-35; 24:14; [2 Chr. 12:9](/2chr#2Chr.12.9); [26:9](/2chr#2Chr.26.9); [27:3](/2chr#2Chr.27.3), [4](/2chr#2Chr.27.4); [29:3](/2chr#2Chr.29.3); [32:30](/2chr#2Chr.32.30); [33:11](/2chr#2Chr.33.11)), till finally, for the abounding iniquities of the nation, after a siege of three years, it was taken and utterly destroyed, its walls razed to the ground, and its temple and palaces consumed by fire, by Nebuchadnezzar, the king of Babylon ([2 Kings 25](/2kgs#2Kgs.25); [2 Chr. 36](/2chr#2Chr.36); [Jer. 39](/jer#Jer.39)), B.C. 588. The desolation of the city and the land was completed by the retreat of the principal Jews into Egypt ([Jer. 40](/jer#Jer.40)-44), and by the final carrying captive into Babylon of all that still remained in the land (52:3), so that it was left without an inhabitant (B.C. 582). Compare the predictions, [Deut. 28](/deut#Deut.28); [Lev. 26:14-39](/lev#Lev.26.14).\n\n But the streets and walls of Jerusalem were again to be built, in troublous times ([Dan. 9:16](/dan#Dan.9.16), [19](/dan#Dan.9.19), [25](/dan#Dan.9.25)), after a captivity of seventy years. This restoration was begun B.C. 536, \u201cin the first year of Cyrus\u201d ([Ezra 1:2](/ezra#Ezra.1.2), [3](/ezra#Ezra.1.3), [5](/ezra#Ezra.1.5)-11). The Books of Ezra and Nehemiah contain the history of the re-building of the city and temple, and the restoration of the kingdom of the Jews, consisting of a portion of all the tribes. The kingdom thus constituted was for two centuries under the dominion of Persia, till B.C. 331; and thereafter, for about a century and a half, under the rulers of the Greek empire in Asia, till B.C. 167. For a century the Jews maintained their independence under native rulers, the Asmonean princes. At the close of this period they fell under the rule of Herod and of members of his family, but practically under Rome, till the time of the destruction of Jerusalem, A.D. 70. The city was then laid in ruins.\n\n The modern Jerusalem by-and-by began to be built over the immense beds of rubbish resulting from the overthrow of the ancient city; and whilst it occupies certainly the same site, there are no evidences that even the lines of its streets are now what they were in the ancient city. Till A.D. 131 the Jews who still lingered about Jerusalem quietly submitted to the Roman sway. But in that year the emperor (Hadrian), in order to hold them in subjection, rebuilt and fortified the city. The Jews, however, took possession of it, having risen under the leadership of one Bar-Chohaba (i.e., \u201cthe son of the star\u201d) in revolt against the Romans. Some four years afterwards (A.D. 135), however, they were driven out of it with great slaughter, and the city was again destroyed; and over its ruins was built a Roman city called Aelia Capitolina, a name which it retained till it fell under the dominion of the Mohammedans, when it was called el-Khuds, i.e., \u201cthe holy.\u201d\n\n In A.D. 326 Helena, mother of the emperor Constantine, made a pilgrimage to Jerusalem with the view of discovering the places mentioned in the life of our Lord. She caused a church to be built on what was then supposed to be the place of the nativity at Bethlehem. Constantine, animated by her example, searched for the holy sepulchre, and built over the supposed site a magnificent church, which was completed and dedicated A.D. 335. He relaxed the laws against the Jews till this time in force, and permitted them once a year to visit the city and wail over the desolation of \u201cthe holy and beautiful house.\u201d\n\n In A.D. 614 the Persians, after defeating the Roman forces of the emperor Heraclius, took Jerusalem by storm, and retained it till A.D. 637, when it was taken by the Arabians under the Khalif Omar. It remained in their possession till it passed, in A.D. 960, under the dominion of the Fatimite khalifs of Egypt, and in A.D. 1073 under the Turcomans. In A.D. 1099 the crusader Godfrey of Bouillon took the city from the Moslems with great slaughter, and was elected king of Jerusalem. He converted the Mosque of Omar into a Christian cathedral. During the eighty-eight years which followed, many churches and convents were erected in the holy city. The Church of the Holy Sepulchre was rebuilt during this period, and it alone remains to this day. In A.D. 1187 the sultan Saladin wrested the city from the Christians. From that time to the present day, with few intervals, Jerusalem has remained in the hands of the Moslems. It has, however, during that period been again and again taken and retaken, demolished in great part and rebuilt, no city in the world having passed through so many vicissitudes.\n\n In the year 1850 the Greek and Latin monks residing in Jerusalem had a fierce dispute about the guardianship of what are called the \u201choly places.\u201d In this dispute the emperor Nicholas of Russia sided with the Greeks, and Louis Napoleon, the emperor of the French, with the Latins. This led the Turkish authorities to settle the question in a way unsatisfactory to Russia. Out of this there sprang the Crimean War, which was protracted and sanguinary, but which had important consequences in the way of breaking down the barriers of Turkish exclusiveness.\n\n Modern Jerusalem \u201clies near the summit of a broad mountain-ridge, which extends without interruption from the plain of Esdraelon to a line drawn between the southern end of the Dead Sea and the southeastern corner of the Mediterranean.\u201d This high, uneven table-land is everywhere from 20 to 25 geographical miles in breadth. It was anciently known as the mountains of Ephraim and Judah.\n\n \u201cJerusalem is a city of contrasts, and differs widely from Damascus, not merely because it is a stone town in mountains, whilst the latter is a mud city in a plain, but because while in Damascus Moslem religion and Oriental custom are unmixed with any foreign element, in Jerusalem every form of religion, every nationality of East and West, is represented at one time.\u201d\n\n Jerusalem is first mentioned under that name in the Book of Joshua, and the Tell-el-Amarna collection of tablets includes six letters from its Amorite king to Egypt, recording the attack of the Abiri about B.C. 1480. The name is there spelt Uru-Salim (\u201ccity of peace\u201d). Another monumental record in which the Holy City is named is that of Sennacherib\u2019s attack in B.C. 702. The \u201ccamp of the Assyrians\u201d was still shown about A.D. 70, on the flat ground to the north-west, included in the new quarter of the city.\n\n The city of David included both the upper city and Millo, and was surrounded by a wall built by David and Solomon, who appear to have restored the original Jebusite fortifications. The name Zion (or Sion) appears to have been, like Ariel (\u201cthe hearth of God\u201d), a poetical term for Jerusalem, but in the Greek age was more specially used of the Temple hill. The priests\u2019 quarter grew up on Ophel, south of the Temple, where also was Solomon\u2019s Palace outside the original city of David. The walls of the city were extended by Jotham and Manasseh to include this suburb and the Temple ([2 Chr. 27:3](/2chr#2Chr.27.3); [33:14](/2chr#2Chr.33.14)).\n\n Jerusalem is now a town of some 50,000 inhabitants, with ancient mediaeval walls, partly on the old lines, but extending less far to the south. The traditional sites, as a rule, were first shown in the 4th and later centuries A.D., and have no authority. The results of excavation have, however, settled most of the disputed questions, the limits of the Temple area, and the course of the old walls having been traced."

                "But besides these two historical fountains there is a third, called the Hasbany, which rises in the bottom of a valley at the western base of Hermon, 12 miles north of Tell-el-Kady. It joins the main stream about a mile below the junction of the Leddan and the Banias. The river thus formed is at this point about 45 feet wide, and flows in a channel from 12 to 20 feet below the plain. After this it flows, \u201cwith a swift current and a much-twisted course,\u201d through a marshy plain for some 6 miles, when it falls into the Lake Huleh, \u201cthe waters of Merom\u201d (q.v.).\n\n During this part of its course the Jordan has descended about 1,100 feet. At Banias it is 1,080 feet above sea-level. Flowing from the southern extremity of Lake Huleh, here almost on a level with the sea, it flows for 2 miles \u201cthrough a waste of islets and papyrus,\u201d and then for 9 miles through a narrow gorge in a foaming torrent onward to the Sea of Galilee (q.v.).\n\n \u201cIn the whole valley of the Jordan from the Lake Huleh to the Sea of Galilee there is not a single settled inhabitant. Along the whole eastern bank of the river and the lakes, from the base of Hermon to the ravine of Hieromax, a region of great fertility, 30 miles long by 7 or 8 wide, there are only some three inhabited villages. The western bank is almost as desolate. Ruins are numerous enough. Every mile or two is an old site of town or village, now well nigh hid beneath a dense jungle of thorns and thistles. The words of Scripture here recur to us with peculiar force: \u2018I will make your cities waste, and bring your sanctuaries unto desolation...And I will bring the land into desolation: and your enemies which dwell therein shall be astonished at it...And your land shall be desolate, and your cities waste. Then shall the land enjoy her sabbaths, as long as it lieth desolate\u2019 ([Lev. 26:31-34](/lev#Lev.26.31)).\u201d, Dr. Porter\u2019s Handbook.\n\n From the Sea of Galilee, at the level of 682 feet below the Mediterranean, the river flows through a long, low plain called \u201cthe region of Jordan\u201d ([Matt. 3:5](/matt#Matt.3.5)), and by the modern Arabs the Ghor, or \u201csunken plain.\u201d This section is properly the Jordan of Scripture. Down through the midst of the \u201cplain of Jordan\u201d there winds a ravine varying in breadth from 200 yards to half a mile, and in depth from 40 to 150 feet. Through it the Jordan flows in a rapid, rugged, tortuous course down to the Dead Sea. The whole distance from the southern extremity of the Sea of Galilee to the Dead Sea is in a straight line about 65 miles, but following the windings of the river about 200 miles, during which it falls 618 feet. The total length of the Jordan from Banias is about 104 miles in a straight line, during which it falls 2,380 feet.\n\n There are two considerable affluents which enter the river between the Sea of Galilee and the Dead Sea, both from the east."

                "Holy, or Kadesh-Barnea, sacred desert of wandering, a place on the south-eastern border of Palestine, about 165 miles from Horeb. It lay in the \u201cwilderness\u201d or \u201cdesert of Zin\u201d ([Gen. 14:7](/gen#Gen.14.7); [Num. 13:3-26](/num#Num.13.3); [14:29-33](/num#Num.14.29); [20:1](/num#Num.20.1); [27:14](/num#Num.27.14)), on the border of Edom (20:16). From this place, in compliance with the desire of the people, Moses sent forth \u201ctwelve spies\u201d to spy the land. After examining it in all its districts, the spies brought back an evil report, Joshua and Caleb alone giving a good report of the land (13:18-31). Influenced by the discouraging report, the people abandoned all hope of entering into the Promised Land. They remained a considerable time at Kadesh. Because of their unbelief, they were condemned by God to wander for thirty-eight years in the wilderness. They took their journey from Kadesh into the deserts of Paran, \u201cby way of the Red Sea\u201d ([Deut. 2:1](/deut#Deut.2.1)). (One theory is that during these thirty-eight years they remained in and about Kadesh.)\n\n At the end of these years of wanderings, the tribes were a second time gathered together at Kadesh. During their stay here at this time Miriam died and was buried. Here the people murmured for want of water, as their forefathers had done formerly at Rephidim; and Moses, irritated by their chidings, \u201cwith his rod smote the rock twice,\u201d instead of \u201cspeaking to the rock before their eyes,\u201d as the Lord had commanded him (comp. [Num. 27:14](/num#Num.27.14); [Deut. 9:23](/deut#Deut.9.23); [Ps. 106:32](/ps#Ps.106.32), [33](/ps#Ps.106.33)). Because of this act of his, in which Aaron too was involved, neither of them was to be permitted to set foot within the Promised Land ([Num. 20:12](/num#Num.20.12), [24](/num#Num.20.24)). The king of Edom would not permit them to pass on through his territory, and therefore they commenced an eastward march, and \u201ccame unto Mount Hor\u201d (20:22).\n\n This place has been identified with \u2018Ain el-Kadeis, about 12 miles east-south-east of Beersheba."

                "Holy, or Kadesh-Barnea, sacred desert of wandering, a place on the south-eastern border of Palestine, about 165 miles from Horeb. It lay in the \u201cwilderness\u201d or \u201cdesert of Zin\u201d ([Gen. 14:7](/gen#Gen.14.7); [Num. 13:3-26](/num#Num.13.3); [14:29-33](/num#Num.14.29); [20:1](/num#Num.20.1); [27:14](/num#Num.27.14)), on the border of Edom (20:16). From this place, in compliance with the desire of the people, Moses sent forth \u201ctwelve spies\u201d to spy the land. After examining it in all its districts, the spies brought back an evil report, Joshua and Caleb alone giving a good report of the land (13:18-31). Influenced by the discouraging report, the people abandoned all hope of entering into the Promised Land. They remained a considerable time at Kadesh. Because of their unbelief, they were condemned by God to wander for thirty-eight years in the wilderness. They took their journey from Kadesh into the deserts of Paran, \u201cby way of the Red Sea\u201d ([Deut. 2:1](/deut#Deut.2.1)). (One theory is that during these thirty-eight years they remained in and about Kadesh.)\n\n At the end of these years of wanderings, the tribes were a second time gathered together at Kadesh. During their stay here at this time Miriam died and was buried. Here the people murmured for want of water, as their forefathers had done formerly at Rephidim; and Moses, irritated by their chidings, \u201cwith his rod smote the rock twice,\u201d instead of \u201cspeaking to the rock before their eyes,\u201d as the Lord had commanded him (comp. [Num. 27:14](/num#Num.27.14); [Deut. 9:23](/deut#Deut.9.23); [Ps. 106:32](/ps#Ps.106.32), [33](/ps#Ps.106.33)). Because of this act of his, in which Aaron too was involved, neither of them was to be permitted to set foot within the Promised Land ([Num. 20:12](/num#Num.20.12), [24](/num#Num.20.24)). The king of Edom would not permit them to pass on through his territory, and therefore they commenced an eastward march, and \u201ccame unto Mount Hor\u201d (20:22).\n\n This place has been identified with \u2018Ain el-Kadeis, about 12 miles east-south-east of Beersheba."

It was probably in the Wady Murrah, and has been identified with the Erweis el-Ebeirig, where the remains of an ancient encampment have been found, about 30 miles north-east of Sinai, and exactly a day\u2019s journey from \u2018Ain Hudherah.\n\n \u201cHere began the troubles of the journey. First, complaints broke out among the people, probably at the heat, the toil, and the privations of the march; and then God at once punished them by lightning, which fell on the hinder part of the camp, and killed many persons, but ceased at the intercession of Moses ([Num. 11:1](/num#Num.11.1), [2](/num#Num.11.2)). Then a disgust fell on the multitude at having nothing to eat but the manna day after day, no change, no flesh, no fish, no high-flavoured vegetables, no luscious fruits...The people loathed the \u2018light food,\u2019 and cried out to Moses, \u2018Give us flesh, give us flesh, that we may eat.\u2019\u201d In this emergency Moses, in despair, cried unto God. An answer came. God sent \u201ca prodigious flight of quails, on which the people satiated their gluttonous appetite for a full month. Then punishment fell on them: they loathed the food which they had desired; it bred disease in them; the divine anger aggravated the disease into a plague, and a heavy mortality was the consequence. The dead were buried without the camp; and in memory of man\u2019s sin and of the divine wrath this name, Kibroth-hattaavah, the Graves of Lust, was given to the place of their sepulchre\u201d ([Num. 11:34](/num#Num.11.34), [35](/num#Num.11.35); 33:16, 17; [Deut. 9:22](/deut#Deut.9.22); comp. [Ps. 78:30](/ps#Ps.78.30), [31](/ps#Ps.78.31))., Rawlinson\u2019s Moses, p. 175. From this encampment they journeyed in a north-eastern direction to Hazeroth."

                "'= Kedron = Cedron, turbid, the winter torrent which flows through the Valley of Jehoshaphat, on the eastern side of Jerusalem, between the city and the Mount of Olives. This valley is known in Scripture only by the name \u201cthe brook Kidron.\u201d David crossed this brook bare-foot and weeping, when fleeing from Absalom ([2 Sam. 15:23](/2sam#2Sam.15.23), [30](/2sam#2Sam.15.30)), and it was frequently crossed by our Lord in his journeyings to and fro ([John 18:1](/john#John.18.1)). Here Asa burned the obscene idols of his mother ([1 Kings 15:13](/1kgs#1Kgs.15.13)), and here Athaliah was executed ([2 Kings 11:16](/2kgs#2Kgs.11.16)). It afterwards became the receptacle for all manner of impurities ([2 Chr. 29:16](/2chr#2Chr.29.16); [30:14](/2chr#2Chr.30.14)); and in the time of Josiah this valley was the common cemetery of the city ([2 Kings 23:6](/2kgs#2Kgs.23.6); comp. [Jer. 26:23](/jer#Jer.26.23)).\n\n Through this mountain ravine no water runs, except after heavy rains in the mountains round about Jerusalem. Its length from its head to en-Rogel is 2 3/4 miles. Its precipitous, rocky banks are filled with ancient tombs, especially the left bank opposite the temple area. The greatest desire of the Jews is to be buried there, from the idea that the Kidron is the \u201cvalley of Jehoshaphat\u201d mentioned in [Joel 3:2](/joel#Joel.3.2).\n\n Below en-Rogel the Kidron has no historical or sacred interest. It runs in a winding course through the wilderness of Judea to the north-western shore of the Dead Sea. Its whole length, in a straight line, is only some 20 miles, but in this space its descent is about 3,912 feet.\n\n Recent excavations have brought to light the fact that the old bed of the Kidron is about 40 feet lower than its present bed, and about 70 feet nearer the sanctuary wall."

After the death of Ahab, Mesha, king of Moab, threw off allegiance to the king of Israel, and fought successfully for the independence of his kingdom. After this Jehoram, king of Israel, in seeking to regain his supremacy over Moab, entered into an alliance with Jehoshaphat, king of Judah, and with the king of Edom. The three kings led their armies against Mesha, who was driven back to seek refuge in Kir-haraseth. The Moabites were driven to despair. Mesha then took his eldest son, who would have reigned in his stead, and offered him as a burnt-offering on the wall of the fortress in the sight of the allied armies. \u201cThere was great indignation against Israel: and they departed from him, and returned to their own land.\u201d The invaders evacuated the land of Moab, and Mesha achieved the independence of his country ([2 Kings 3:20-27](/2kgs#2Kgs.3.20))."

                "Impregnable, a royal Canaanitish city in the Shephelah, or maritime plain of Palestine ([Josh. 10:3](/josh#Josh.10.3), [5](/josh#Josh.10.5); 12:11). It was taken and destroyed by the Israelites ([Josh. 10:31-33](/josh#Josh.10.31)). It afterwards became, under Rehoboam, one of the strongest fortresses of Judah ([2 Chr. 10:9](/2chr#2Chr.10.9)). It was assaulted and probably taken by Sennacherib ([2 Kings 18:14](/2kgs#2Kgs.18.14), [17](/2kgs#2Kgs.18.17); 19:8; [Isa. 36:2](/isa#Isa.36.2)). An account of this siege is given on some slabs found in the chambers of the palace of Koyunjik, and now in the British Museum. The inscription has been deciphered as follows:, \u201cSennacherib, the mighty king, king of the country of Assyria, sitting on the throne of judgment before the city of Lachish: I gave permission for its slaughter.\u201d\n\n Lachish has been identified with Tell-el-Hesy, where a cuneiform tablet has been found, containing a letter supposed to be from Amenophis at Amarna in reply to one of the Amarna tablets sent by Zimrida from Lachish. This letter is from the chief of Atim (=Etam, [1 Chr. 4:32](/1chr#1Chr.4.32)) to the chief of Lachish, in which the writer expresses great alarm at the approach of marauders from the Hebron hills. \u201cThey have entered the land,\u201d he says, \u201cto lay waste...strong is he who has come down. He lays waste.\u201d This letter shows that \u201cthe communication by tablets in cuneiform script was not only usual in writing to Egypt, but in the internal correspondence of the country. The letter, though not so important in some ways as the Moabite stone and the Siloam text, is one of the most valuable discoveries ever made in Palestine\u201d (Conder\u2019s Tell Amarna Tablets, p. 134).\n\n Excavations at Lachish are still going on, and among other discoveries is that of an iron blast-furnace, with slag and ashes, which is supposed to have existed B.C. 1500. If the theories of experts are correct, the use of the hot-air blast instead of cold air (an improvement in iron manufacture patented by Neilson in 1828) was known fifteen hundred years before Christ."

It was originally called Diospolis and then Rhoas, but afterwards Laodicea, from Laodice, the wife of Antiochus II., king of Syria, who rebuilt it. It was one of the most important and flourishing cities of Asia Minor. At a very early period it became one of the chief seats of Christianity ([Col. 2:1](/col#Col.2.1); [4:15](/col#Col.4.15); [Rev. 1:11](/rev#Rev.1.11), etc.).

                "White, \u201cthe white mountain of Syria,\u201d is the loftiest and most celebrated mountain range in Syria. It is a branch running southward from the Caucasus, and at its lower end forking into two parallel ranges, the eastern or Anti-Lebanon, and the western or Lebanon proper. They enclose a long valley ([Josh. 11:17](/josh#Josh.11.17)) of from 5 to 8 miles in width, called by Roman writers Coele-Syria, now called el-Buka\u2019a, \u201cthe valley,\u201d a prolongation of the valley of the Jordan.\n\n Lebanon proper, Jebel es-Sharki, commences at its southern extremity in the gorge of the Leontes, the ancient Litany, and extends north-east, parallel to the Mediterranean coast, as far as the river Eleutherus, at the plain of Emesa, \u201cthe entering of Hamath\u201d ([Num. 34:8](/num#Num.34.8); [1 Kings 8:65](/1kgs#1Kgs.8.65)), in all about 90 geographical miles in extent. The average height of this range is from 6,000 to 8,000 feet; the peak of Jebel Mukhmel is about 10,200 feet, and the Sannin about 9,000. The highest peaks are covered with perpetual snow and ice. In the recesses of the range wild beasts as of old still abound ([2 Kings 14:9](/2kgs#2Kgs.14.9); [Cant. 4:8](/song#Song.4.8)). The scenes of the Lebanon are remarkable for their grandeur and beauty, and supplied the sacred writers with many expressive similes ([Ps. 29:5](/ps#Ps.29.5), [6](/ps#Ps.29.6); [72:16](/ps#Ps.72.16); [104:16-18](/ps#Ps.104.16); [Cant. 4:15](/song#Song.4.15); [Isa. 2:13](/isa#Isa.2.13); [35:2](/isa#Isa.35.2); [60:13](/isa#Isa.60.13); [Hos. 14:5](/hos#Hos.14.5)). It is famous for its cedars ([Cant. 5:15](/song#Song.5.15)), its wines ([Hos. 14:7](/hos#Hos.14.7)), and its cool waters ([Jer. 18:14](/jer#Jer.18.14)). The ancient inhabitants were Giblites and Hivites ([Josh. 13:5](/josh#Josh.13.5); [Judg. 3:3](/judg#Judg.3.3)). It was part of the Phoenician kingdom ([1 Kings 5:2-6](/1kgs#1Kgs.5.2)).\n\n The eastern range, or Anti-Lebanon, or \u201cLebanon towards the sunrising,\u201d runs nearly parallel with the western from the plain of Emesa till it connects with the hills of Galilee in the south. The height of this range is about 5,000 feet. Its highest peak is Hermon (q.v.), from which a number of lesser ranges radiate.\n\n Lebanon is first mentioned in the description of the boundary of Palestine ([Deut. 1:7](/deut#Deut.1.7); [11:24](/deut#Deut.11.24)). It was assigned to Israel, but was never conquered ([Josh. 13:2-6](/josh#Josh.13.2); [Judg. 3:1-3](/judg#Judg.3.1)).\n\n The Lebanon range is now inhabited by a population of about 300,000 Christians, Maronites, and Druses, and is ruled by a Christian governor. The Anti-Lebanon is inhabited by Mohammedans, and is under a Turkish ruler."

                "White, \u201cthe white mountain of Syria,\u201d is the loftiest and most celebrated mountain range in Syria. It is a branch running southward from the Caucasus, and at its lower end forking into two parallel ranges, the eastern or Anti-Lebanon, and the western or Lebanon proper. They enclose a long valley ([Josh. 11:17](/josh#Josh.11.17)) of from 5 to 8 miles in width, called by Roman writers Coele-Syria, now called el-Buka\u2019a, \u201cthe valley,\u201d a prolongation of the valley of the Jordan.\n\n Lebanon proper, Jebel es-Sharki, commences at its southern extremity in the gorge of the Leontes, the ancient Litany, and extends north-east, parallel to the Mediterranean coast, as far as the river Eleutherus, at the plain of Emesa, \u201cthe entering of Hamath\u201d ([Num. 34:8](/num#Num.34.8); [1 Kings 8:65](/1kgs#1Kgs.8.65)), in all about 90 geographical miles in extent. The average height of this range is from 6,000 to 8,000 feet; the peak of Jebel Mukhmel is about 10,200 feet, and the Sannin about 9,000. The highest peaks are covered with perpetual snow and ice. In the recesses of the range wild beasts as of old still abound ([2 Kings 14:9](/2kgs#2Kgs.14.9); [Cant. 4:8](/song#Song.4.8)). The scenes of the Lebanon are remarkable for their grandeur and beauty, and supplied the sacred writers with many expressive similes ([Ps. 29:5](/ps#Ps.29.5), [6](/ps#Ps.29.6); [72:16](/ps#Ps.72.16); [104:16-18](/ps#Ps.104.16); [Cant. 4:15](/song#Song.4.15); [Isa. 2:13](/isa#Isa.2.13); [35:2](/isa#Isa.35.2); [60:13](/isa#Isa.60.13); [Hos. 14:5](/hos#Hos.14.5)). It is famous for its cedars ([Cant. 5:15](/song#Song.5.15)), its wines ([Hos. 14:7](/hos#Hos.14.7)), and its cool waters ([Jer. 18:14](/jer#Jer.18.14)). The ancient inhabitants were Giblites and Hivites ([Josh. 13:5](/josh#Josh.13.5); [Judg. 3:3](/judg#Judg.3.3)). It was part of the Phoenician kingdom ([1 Kings 5:2-6](/1kgs#1Kgs.5.2)).\n\n The eastern range, or Anti-Lebanon, or \u201cLebanon towards the sunrising,\u201d runs nearly parallel with the western from the plain of Emesa till it connects with the hills of Galilee in the south. The height of this range is about 5,000 feet. Its highest peak is Hermon (q.v.), from which a number of lesser ranges radiate.\n\n Lebanon is first mentioned in the description of the boundary of Palestine ([Deut. 1:7](/deut#Deut.1.7); [11:24](/deut#Deut.11.24)). It was assigned to Israel, but was never conquered ([Josh. 13:2-6](/josh#Josh.13.2); [Judg. 3:1-3](/judg#Judg.3.1)).\n\n The Lebanon range is now inhabited by a population of about 300,000 Christians, Maronites, and Druses, and is ruled by a Christian governor. The Anti-Lebanon is inhabited by Mohammedans, and is under a Turkish ruler."

                "Portion; double cave, the cave which Abraham bought, together with the field in which it stood, from Ephron the Hittite, for a family burying-place ([Gen. 23](/gen#Gen.23)). It is one of those Bible localities about the identification of which there can be no doubt. It was on the slope of a hill on the east of Hebron, \u201cbefore Mamre.\u201d Here were laid the bodies of Abraham and Sarah, Isaac and Rebekah, Jacob and Leah ([Gen. 23:19](/gen#Gen.23.19); [25:9](/gen#Gen.25.9); [49:31](/gen#Gen.49.31); [50:13](/gen#Gen.50.13)). Over the cave an ancient Christian church was erected, probably in the time of Justinian, the Roman emperor. This church has been converted into a Mohammedan mosque. The whole is surrounded by the el-Haram i.e., \u201cthe sacred enclosure,\u201d about 200 feet long, 115 broad, and of an average height of about 50. This building, from the immense size of some of its stones, and the manner in which they are fitted together, is supposed by some to have been erected in the days of David or of Solomon, while others ascribe it to the time of Herod. It is looked upon as the most ancient and finest relic of Jewish architecture.\n\n On the floor of the mosque are erected six large cenotaphs as monuments to the dead who are buried in the cave beneath. Between the cenotaphs of Isaac and Rebekah there is a circular opening in the floor into the cavern below, the cave of Machpelah. Here it may be that the body of Jacob, which was embalmed in Egypt, is still preserved (much older embalmed bodies have recently been found in the cave of Deir el-Bahari in Egypt), though those of the others there buried may have long ago mouldered into dust. The interior of the mosque was visited by the Prince of Wales in 1862 by a special favour of the Mohammedan authorities. An interesting account of this visit is given in Dean Stanley\u2019s Lectures on the Jewish Church. It was also visited in 1866 by the Marquis of Bute, and in 1869 by the late Emperor (Frederick) of Germany, then the Crown Prince of Prussia. In 1881 it was visited by the two sons of the Prince of Wales, accompanied by Sir C. Wilson and others."

                "Two camps, a place near the Jabbok, beyond Jordan, where Jacob was met by the \u201cangels of God,\u201d and where he divided his retinue into \u201ctwo hosts\u201d on his return from Padan-aram ([Gen. 32:2](/gen#Gen.32.2)). This name was afterwards given to the town which was built at that place. It was the southern boundary of Bashan ([Josh. 13:26](/josh#Josh.13.26), [30](/josh#Josh.13.30)), and became a city of the Levites (21:38). Here Saul\u2019s son Ishbosheth reigned ([2 Sam. 2:8](/2sam#2Sam.2.8), [12](/2sam#2Sam.2.12)), while David reigned at Hebron. Here also, after a troubled reign, Ishbosheth was murdered by two of his own bodyguard ([2 Sam. 4:5-7](/2sam#2Sam.4.5)), who brought his head to David at Hebron, but were, instead of being rewarded, put to death by him for their cold-blooded murder. Many years after this, when he fled from Jerusalem on the rebellion of his son Absalom, David made Mahanaim, where Barzillai entertained him, his headquarters, and here he mustered his forces which were led against the army that had gathered around Absalom. It was while sitting at the gate of this town that tidings of the great and decisive battle between the two hosts and of the death of his son Absalom reached him, when he gave way to the most violent grief ([2 Sam. 17:24-27](/2sam#2Sam.17.24)).\n\n The only other reference to Mahanaim is as a station of one of Solomon\u2019s purveyors ([1 Kings 4:14](/1kgs#1Kgs.4.14)). It has been identified with the modern Mukhumah, a ruin found in a depressed plain called el-Bukie\u2019a, \u201cthe little vale,\u201d near Penuel, south of the Jabbok, and north-east of es-Salt."

Madai, which is rendered in the Authorized Version (1) \u201cMadai,\u201d [Gen. 10:2](/gen#Gen.10.2); ([2](/gen#Gen.2)) \u201cMedes,\u201d [2 Kings 17:6](/2kgs#2Kgs.17.6); [18:11](/2kgs#2Kgs.18.11); ([3](/2kgs#2Kgs.3)) \u201cMedia,\u201d [Esther 1:3](/esth#Esth.1.3); [10:2](/esth#Esth.10.2); [Isa. 21:2](/isa#Isa.21.2); [Dan. 8:20](/dan#Dan.8.20); ([4](/dan#Dan.4)) \u201cMede,\u201d only in [Dan. 11:1](/dan#Dan.11.1).\n\n We first hear of this people in the Assyrian cuneiform records, under the name of Amada, about B.C. 840. They appear to have been a branch of the Aryans, who came from the east bank of the Indus, and were probably the predominant race for a while in the Mesopotamian valley. They consisted for three or four centuries of a number of tribes, each ruled by its own chief, who at length were brought under the Assyrian yoke ([2 Kings 17:6](/2kgs#2Kgs.17.6)). From this subjection they achieved deliverance, and formed themselves into an empire under Cyaxares (B.C. 633). This monarch entered into an alliance with the king of Babylon, and invaded Assyria, capturing and destroying the city of Nineveh (B.C. 625), thus putting an end to the Assyrian monarchy ([Nah. 1:8](/nah#Nah.1.8); [2:5](/nah#Nah.2.5), [6](/nah#Nah.2.6); [3:13](/nah#Nah.3.13), [14](/nah#Nah.3.14)).\n\n Media now rose to a place of great power, vastly extending its boundaries. But it did not long exist as an independent kingdom. It rose with Cyaxares, its first king, and it passed away with him; for during the reign of his son and successor Astyages, the Persians waged war against the Medes and conquered them, the two nations being united under one monarch, Cyrus the Persian (B.C. 558).\n\n The \u201ccities of the Medes\u201d are first mentioned in connection with the deportation of the Israelites on the destruction of Samaria ([2 Kings 17:6](/2kgs#2Kgs.17.6); [18:11](/2kgs#2Kgs.18.11)). Soon afterwards Isaiah (13:17; 21:2) speaks of the part taken by the Medes in the destruction of Babylon (comp. [Jer. 51:11](/jer#Jer.51.11), [28](/jer#Jer.51.28)). Daniel gives an account of the reign of Darius the Mede, who was made viceroy by Cyrus ([Dan. 6:1-28](/dan#Dan.6.1)). The decree of Cyrus, Ezra informs us (6:2-5), was found in \u201cthe palace that is in the province of the Medes,\u201d Achmetha or Ecbatana of the Greeks, which is the only Median city mentioned in Scripture."

It was here Barak gained a notable victory over Jabin, the king of Hazor, whose general, Sisera, led on the hostile army. Barak rallied the warriors of the northern tribes, and under the encouragement of Deborah (q.v.), the prophetess, attacked the Canaanites in the great plain. The army of Sisera was thrown into complete confusion, and was engulfed in the waters of the Kishon, which had risen and overflowed its banks ([Judg. 4:5](/judg#Judg.4.5)).\n\n Many years after this (B.C. 610), Pharaohnecho II., on his march against the king of Assyria, passed through the plains of Philistia and Sharon; and King Josiah, attempting to bar his progress in the plain of Megiddo, was defeated by the Egyptians. He was wounded in battle, and died as they bore him away in his chariot towards Jerusalem ([2 Kings 23:29](/2kgs#2Kgs.23.29); [2 Chr. 35:22-24](/2chr#2Chr.35.22)), and all Israel mourned for him. So general and bitter was this mourning that it became a proverb, to which Zechariah (12:11, 12) alludes. Megiddo has been identified with the modern el-Lejjun, at the head of the Kishon, under the north-eastern brow of Carmel, on the south-western edge of the plain of Esdraelon, and 9 miles west of Jezreel. Others identify it with Mujedd\u2019a, 4 miles south-west of Bethshean, but the question of its site is still undetermined."

It is said to have been founded by Menes, the first king of Egypt, and to have been in circumference about 19 miles. \u201cThere are few remains above ground,\u201d says Manning (The Land of the Pharaohs), \u201cof the splendour of ancient Memphis. The city has utterly disappeared. If any traces yet exist, they are buried beneath the vast mounds of crumbling bricks and broken pottery which meet the eye in every direction. Near the village of Mitraheny is a colossal statue of Rameses the Great. It is apparently one of the two described by Herodotus and Diodorus as standing in front of the temple of Ptah. They were originally 50 feet in height. The one which remains, though mutilated, measures 48 feet. It is finely carved in limestone, which takes a high polish, and is evidently a portrait. It lies in a pit, which, during the inundation, is filled with water. As we gaze on this fallen and battered statue of the mighty conqueror who was probably contemporaneous with Moses, it is impossible not to remember the words of the prophet Isaiah, 19:13; 44:16-19, and Jeremiah, 46:19.\u201d"

                "Holy, or Kadesh-Barnea, sacred desert of wandering, a place on the south-eastern border of Palestine, about 165 miles from Horeb. It lay in the \u201cwilderness\u201d or \u201cdesert of Zin\u201d ([Gen. 14:7](/gen#Gen.14.7); [Num. 13:3-26](/num#Num.13.3); [14:29-33](/num#Num.14.29); [20:1](/num#Num.20.1); [27:14](/num#Num.27.14)), on the border of Edom (20:16). From this place, in compliance with the desire of the people, Moses sent forth \u201ctwelve spies\u201d to spy the land. After examining it in all its districts, the spies brought back an evil report, Joshua and Caleb alone giving a good report of the land (13:18-31). Influenced by the discouraging report, the people abandoned all hope of entering into the Promised Land. They remained a considerable time at Kadesh. Because of their unbelief, they were condemned by God to wander for thirty-eight years in the wilderness. They took their journey from Kadesh into the deserts of Paran, \u201cby way of the Red Sea\u201d ([Deut. 2:1](/deut#Deut.2.1)). (One theory is that during these thirty-eight years they remained in and about Kadesh.)\n\n At the end of these years of wanderings, the tribes were a second time gathered together at Kadesh. During their stay here at this time Miriam died and was buried. Here the people murmured for want of water, as their forefathers had done formerly at Rephidim; and Moses, irritated by their chidings, \u201cwith his rod smote the rock twice,\u201d instead of \u201cspeaking to the rock before their eyes,\u201d as the Lord had commanded him (comp. [Num. 27:14](/num#Num.27.14); [Deut. 9:23](/deut#Deut.9.23); [Ps. 106:32](/ps#Ps.106.32), [33](/ps#Ps.106.33)). Because of this act of his, in which Aaron too was involved, neither of them was to be permitted to set foot within the Promised Land ([Num. 20:12](/num#Num.20.12), [24](/num#Num.20.24)). The king of Edom would not permit them to pass on through his territory, and therefore they commenced an eastward march, and \u201ccame unto Mount Hor\u201d (20:22).\n\n This place has been identified with \u2018Ain el-Kadeis, about 12 miles east-south-east of Beersheba."

It was the scene of the third and last great victory gained by Joshua over the Canaanites ([Josh. 11:5-7](/josh#Josh.11.5)). It is not again mentioned in Scripture. Its modern name is Bakrat el-Huleh. \u201cThe Ard el-Huleh, the centre of which the lake occupies, is a nearly level plain of 16 miles in length from north to south, and its breadth from east to west is from 7 to 8 miles. On the west it is walled in by the steep and lofty range of the hills of Kedesh-Naphtali; on the east it is bounded by the lower and more gradually ascending slopes of Bashan; on the north it is shut in by a line of hills hummocky and irregular in shape and of no great height, and stretching across from the mountains of Naphtali to the roots of Mount Hermon, which towers up at the north-eastern angle of the plain to a height of 10,000 feet. At its southern extremity the plain is similarly traversed by elevated and broken ground, through which, by deep and narrow clefts, the Jordan, after passing through Lake Huleh, makes its rapid descent to the Sea of Galilee.\u201d\n\n The lake is triangular in form, about 4 1/2 miles in length by 3 1/2 at its greatest breadth. Its surface is 7 feet above that of the Mediterranean. It is surrounded by a morass, which is thickly covered with canes and papyrus reeds, which are impenetrable. Macgregor with his canoe, the Rob Roy, was the first that ever, in modern times, sailed on its waters."

                "An Arabian tribe descended from Midian. They inhabited principally the desert north of the peninsula of Arabia. The peninsula of Sinai was the pasture-ground for their flocks. They were virtually the rulers of Arabia, being the dominant tribe. Like all Arabians, they were a nomad people. They early engaged in commercial pursuits. It was to one of their caravans that Joseph was sold ([Gen. 37:28](/gen#Gen.37.28), [36](/gen#Gen.37.36)). The next notice of them is in connection with Moses\u2019 flight from Egypt ([Ex. 2:15-21](/exod#Exod.2.15)). Here in Midian Moses became the servant and afterwards the son-in-law of Reuel or Jethro, the priest. After the Exodus, the Midianites were friendly to the Israelites so long as they traversed only their outlying pasture-ground on the west of the Arabah; but when, having passed the southern end of Edom, they entered into the land of Midian proper, they joined with Balak, the king of Moab, in a conspiracy against them ([Num. 22:4-7](/num#Num.22.4)). Balaam, who had been sent for to curse Israel, having utterly failed to do so, was dismissed by the king of Moab; nevertheless he still tarried among the Midianites, and induced them to enter into correspondence with the Israelites, so as to bring them into association with them in the licentious orgies connected with the worship of Baal-Peor. This crafty counsel prevailed. The Israelites took part in the heathen festival, and so brought upon themselves a curse indeed. Their apostasy brought upon them a severe punishment. A plague broke out amongst them, and more than twenty-four thousand of the people perished ([Num. 25:9](/num#Num.25.9)). But the Midianites were not to be left unpunished. A terrible vengeance was denounced against them. A thousand warriors from each tribe, under the leadership of Phinehas, went forth against them. The Midianites were utterly routed. Their cities were consumed by fire, five of their kings were put to death, and the whole nation was destroyed ([Josh. 13:21](/josh#Josh.13.21), [22](/josh#Josh.13.22)). Balaam also perished by the sword, receiving the \u201cwages of his unrighteousness\u201d ([Num. 31:8](/num#Num.31.8); 2 Pet. 2:15). The whole of the country on the east of Jordan, now conquered by the Israelites (see SIHON;  OG), was divided between the two tribes of Reuben and Gad and the half tribe of Manasseh.\n\n Some two hundred and fifty years after this the Midianites had regained their ancient power, and in confederation with the Amalekites and the \u201cchildren of the east\u201d they made war against their old enemies the Israelites, whom for seven years they oppressed and held in subjection. They were at length assailed by Gideon in that ever-memorable battle in the great plain of Esdraelon, and utterly destroyed ([Judg. 6:1](/judg#Judg.6.1)-ch. 7). Frequent allusions are afterwards made to this great victory ([Ps. 83:10](/ps#Ps.83.10), [12](/ps#Ps.83.12); [Isa. 9:4](/isa#Isa.9.4); [10:6](/isa#Isa.10.6)). They now wholly pass away from the page of history both sacred and profane."

                "A city of Benjamin, \u201cthe watch-tower\u201d, where the people were accustomed to meet in great national emergencies ([Josh. 18:26](/josh#Josh.18.26); [Judg. 20:1](/judg#Judg.20.1), [3](/judg#Judg.20.3); 21:1, 5; [1 Sam. 7:5-16](/1sam#1Sam.7.5)). It has been supposed to be the same as Nob ([1 Sam. 21:1](/1sam#1Sam.21.1); [22:9-19](/1sam#1Sam.22.9)). It was some 4 miles north-west of Jerusalem, and was situated on the loftiest hill in the neighbourhood, some 600 feet above the plain of Gibeon. This village has the modern name of Neby Samwil, i.e., the prophet Samuel, from a tradition that Samuel\u2019s tomb is here.\n\n Samuel inaugurated the reformation that characterized his time by convening a great assembly of all Israel at Mizpeh, now the politico-religious centre of the nation. There, in deep humiliation on account of their sins, they renewed their vows and entered again into covenant with the God of their fathers. It was a period of great religious awakening and of revived national life. The Philistines heard of this assembly, and came up against Israel. The Hebrews charged the Philistine host with great fury, and they were totally routed. Samuel commemorated this signal victory by erecting a memorial-stone, which he called \u201cEbenezer\u201d (q.v.), saying, \u201cHitherto hath the Lord helped us\u201d ([1 Sam. 7:7-12](/1sam#1Sam.7.7))."

It was at that time in the possession of the Amorites ([Num. 21:22](/num#Num.21.22)). \u201cMoses went up from the plains of Moab unto the mountain of Nebo, to the top of Pisgah,\u201d and \u201cdied there in the land of Moab, according to the word of the Lord\u201d ([Deut. 34:5](/deut#Deut.34.5), [6](/deut#Deut.34.6)). \u201cSurely if we had nothing else to interest us in the land of Moab, the fact that it was from the top of Pisgah, its noblest height, this mightiest of the prophets looked out with eye undimmed upon the Promised Land; that it was here on Nebo, its loftiest mountain, that he died his solitary death; that it was here, in the valley over against Beth-peor, he found his mysterious sepulchre, we have enough to enshrine the memory in our hearts.\u201d"

Here Solomon\u2019s temple was built, on the spot that had been the threshing-floor of Ornan the Jebusite ([2 Sam. 24:24](/2sam#2Sam.24.24), [25](/2sam#2Sam.24.25); [2 Chr. 3:1](/2chr#2Chr.3.1)). It is usually included in Zion, to the north-east of which it lay, and from which it was separated by the Tyropoean valley. This was \u201cthe land of Moriah\u201d to which Abraham went to offer up his son Isaac ([Gen. 22:2](/gen#Gen.22.2)). It has been supposed that the highest point of the temple hill, which is now covered by the Mohammedan Kubbetes-Sakhrah, or \u201cDome of the Rock,\u201d is the actual site of Araunah\u2019s threshing-floor. Here also, one thousand years after Abraham, David built an altar and offered sacrifices to God."

                "A mountain of Samaria, about 3,000 feet above the Mediterranean. It was on the left of the valley containing the ancient town of Shechem (q.v.), on the way to Jerusalem. It stood over against Mount Ebal, the summits of these mountains being distant from each other about 2 miles ([Deut. 27](/deut#Deut.27); [Josh. 8:30-35](/josh#Josh.8.30)). On the slopes of this mountain the tribes descended from the handmaids of Leah and Rachel, together with the tribe of Reuben, were gathered together, and gave the responses to the blessing pronounced as the reward of obedience, when Joshua in the valley below read the whole law in the hearing of all the people; as those gathered on Ebal responded with a loud Amen to the rehearsal of the curses pronounced on the disobedient. It was probably at this time that the coffin containing the embalmed body of Joseph was laid in the \u201cparcel of ground which Jacob bought of the sons of Hamor\u201d ([Gen. 33:19](/gen#Gen.33.19); [50:25](/gen#Gen.50.25)).\n\n Josephus relates (Ant. 11:8, 2-4) that Sanballat built a temple for the Samaritans on this mountain, and instituted a priesthood, as rivals to those of the Jews at Jerusalem. This temple was destroyed after it had stood two hundred years. It was afterwards rebuilt by Herod the Great. There is a Samaritan tradition that it was the scene of the incident recorded in [Gen. 22](/gen#Gen.22). There are many ruins on this mountain, some of which are evidently of Christian buildings. To this mountain the woman of Sychar referred in [John 4:20](/john#John.4.20). For centuries Gerizim was the centre of political outbreaks. The Samaritans (q.v.), a small but united body, still linger here, and keep up their ancient ceremonial worship."

It was one of the stations of the Israelites in the wilderness (33:37), which they reached in the circuitous route they were obliged to take because the Edomites refused them a passage through their territory. It was during the encampment here that Aaron died ([Num. 33:37-41](/num#Num.33.37)). The Israelites passed this mountain several times in their wanderings. It bears the modern name of Jebel Harun, and is the highest and most conspicious of the whole range. It stands about midway between the Dead Sea and the Elanitic gulf. It has two summits, in the hallow between which it is supposed that Aaron died. Others, however, suppose that this mountain is the modern Jebel Madurah, on the opposite, i.e., the western, side of the Arabah."

It is first mentioned in connection with David\u2019s flight from Jerusalem through the rebellion of Absalom ([2 Sam. 15:30](/2sam#2Sam.15.30)), and is only once again mentioned in the Old Testament, in [Zech. 14:4](/zech#Zech.14.4). It is, however, frequently alluded to ([1 Kings 11:7](/1kgs#1Kgs.11.7); [2 Kings 23:13](/2kgs#2Kgs.23.13); [Neh. 8:15](/neh#Neh.8.15); [Ezek. 11:23](/ezek#Ezek.11.23)).\n\n It is frequently mentioned in the New Testament ([Matt. 21:1](/matt#Matt.21.1); [26:30](/matt#Matt.26.30), etc.). It now bears the name of Jebel et-Tur, i.e., \u201cMount of the Summit;\u201d also sometimes called Jebel ez-Zeitun, i.e., \u201cMount of Olives.\u201d It is about 200 feet above the level of the city. The road from Jerusalem to Bethany runs as of old over this mount. It was on this mount that Jesus stood when he wept over Jerusalem. \u201cNo name in Scripture,\u201d says Dr. Porter, \u201ccalls up associations at once so sacred and so pleasing as that of Olivet. The \u2018mount\u2019 is so intimately connected with the private, the devotional life of the Saviour, that we read of it and look at it with feelings of deepest interest and affection. Here he often sat with his disciples, telling them of wondrous events yet to come, of the destruction of the Holy City; of the sufferings, the persecution, and the final triumph of his followers ([Matt. 24](/matt#Matt.24)). Here he gave them the beautiful parables of the ten virgins and the five talents (25); here he was wont to retire on each evening for meditation, and prayer, and rest of body, when weary and harassed by the labours and trials of the day ([Luke 21:37](/luke#Luke.21.37)); and here he came on the night of his betrayal to utter that wonderful prayer, \u2018O my Father, if it be possible, let this cup pass from me: nevertheless not as I will, but as thou wilt\u2019 ([Matt. 26:39](/matt#Matt.26.39)). And when the cup of God\u2019s wrath had been drunk, and death and the grave conquered, he led his disciples out again over Olivet as far as to Bethany, and after a parting blessing ascended to heaven ([Luke 24:50](/luke#Luke.24.50), [51](/luke#Luke.24.51); [Acts 1:12](/acts#Acts.1.12)).\u201d\n\n This mount, or rather mountain range, has four summits or peaks: (1) the \u201cGalilee\u201d peak, so called from a tradition that the angels stood here when they spoke to the disciples ([Acts 1:11](/acts#Acts.1.11)); (2) the \u201cMount of Ascension,\u201d the supposed site of that event, which was, however, somewhere probably nearer Bethany ([Luke 24:51](/luke#Luke.24.51), [52](/luke#Luke.24.52)); (3) the \u201cProphets,\u201d from the catacombs on its side, called \u201cthe prophets\u2019 tombs;\u201d and (4) the \u201cMount of Corruption,\u201d so called because of the \u201chigh places\u201d erected there by Solomon for the idolatrous worship of his foreign wives ([1 Kings 11:7](/1kgs#1Kgs.11.7); [2 Kings 23:13](/2kgs#2Kgs.23.13); Vulg., \u201cMount of Offence\u201d)."

The last twenty-two chapters of Exodus, together with the whole of Leviticus and Nu ch. 1-11, contain a record of all the transactions which occurred while they were here. From Rephidim ( Exodus 17:8-13  ) the Israelites journeyed forward through the Wady Solaf and Wady esh-Sheikh into the plain of er-Rahah, \"the desert of Sinai,\" about 2 miles long and half a mile broad, and encamped there \"before the mountain.\" The part of the mountain range, a protruding lower bluff, known as the Ras Sasafeh (Sufsafeh), rises almost perpendicularly from this plain, and is in all probability the Sinai of history. Dean Stanley thus describes the scene:, \"The plain itself is not broken and uneven and narrowly shut in, like almost all others in the range, but presents a long retiring sweep, within which the people could remove and stand afar off. The cliff, rising like a huge altar in front of the whole congregation, and visible against the sky in lonely grandeur from end to end of the whole plain, is the very image of the 'mount that might be touched,' and from which the voice of God might be heard far and wide over the plain below.\" This was the scene of the giving of the law. From the Ras Sufsafeh the law was proclaimed to the people encamped below in the plain of er-Rahah.

They are now an organized nation, bound by covenant engagement to serve the Lord their God, their ever-present divine Leader and Protector. At length, in the second month of the second year of the Exodus, they move their camp and march forward according to a prescribed order. After three days they reach the \"wilderness of Paran,\" the \"et-Tih\", i.e., \"the desert\", and here they make their first encampment. At this time a spirit of discontent broke out amongst them, and the Lord manifested his displeasure by a fire which fell on the encampment and inflicted injury on them. Moses called the place Taberah (q.v.),  Numbers 11:1-3  . The journey between Sinai and the southern boundary of the Promised Land (about 150 miles) at Kadesh was accomplished in about a year.

The reference, however, of the psalm is probably to [Josh. 11](/josh#Josh.11) and 12.

It was surrounded on all sides, except the north, by deep valleys, that of the Tyropoeon (q.v.) separating it from Moriah (q.v.), which it surpasses in height by 105 feet. It was the south-eastern hill of Jerusalem.\n\n When David took it from the Jebusites ([Josh. 15:63](/josh#Josh.15.63); [2 Sam. 5:7](/2sam#2Sam.5.7)) he built on it a citadel and a palace, and it became \u201cthe city of David\u201d ([1 Kings 8:1](/1kgs#1Kgs.8.1); [2 Kings 19:21](/2kgs#2Kgs.19.21), [31](/2kgs#2Kgs.19.31); [1 Chr. 11:5](/1chr#1Chr.11.5)). In the later books of the Old Testament this name was sometimes used ([Ps. 87:2](/ps#Ps.87.2); [149:2](/ps#Ps.149.2); [Isa. 33:14](/isa#Isa.33.14); [Joel 2:1](/joel#Joel.2.1)) to denote Jerusalem in general, and sometimes God\u2019s chosen Israel ([Ps. 51:18](/ps#Ps.51.18); [87:5](/ps#Ps.87.5)).\n\n In the New Testament it is used sometimes to denote the Church of God ([Heb. 12:22](/heb#Heb.12.22)), and sometimes the heavenly city ([Rev. 14:1](/rev#Rev.14.1))."

            "dictionaryText": " separated, generally supposed to be the Greek form of the Hebrew <i> netser</i> , a \"shoot\" or \"sprout.\" Some, however, think that the name of the city must be connected with the name of the hill behind it, from which one of the finest prospects in Palestine is obtained, and accordingly they derive it from the Hebrew <i> notserah</i> , i.e., one guarding or watching, thus designating the hill which overlooks and thus guards an extensive region.   This city is not mentioned in the Old Testament. It was the home of Joseph and Mary ( Luke 2:39  ), and here the angel announced to the Virgin the birth of the Messiah ( 1:26-28  ). Here Jesus grew up from his infancy to manhood ( 4:16  ); and here he began his public ministry in the synagogue ( Matthew 13:54  ), at which the people were so offended that they sought to cast him down from the precipice whereon their city was built ( Luke 4:29  ). Twice they expelled him from their borders ( 4:16-29  ;  Matthew 13:54-58  ); and he finally retired from the city, where he did not many mighty works because of their unbelief ( Matthew 13:58  ), and took up his residence in Capernaum.    Nazareth is situated among the southern ridges of Lebanon, on the steep slope of a hill, about 14 miles from the Sea of Galilee and about 6 west from Mount Tabor. It is identified with the modern village en-Nazirah, of six or ten thousand inhabitants. It lies \"as in a hollow cup\" lower down upon the hill than the ancient city. The main road for traffic between Egypt and the interior of Asia passed by Nazareth near the foot of Tabor, and thence northward to Damascus.    It is supposed from the words of Nathanael in  John 1:46   that the city of Nazareth was held in great disrepute, either because, it is said, the people of Galilee were a rude and less cultivated class, and were largely influenced by the Gentiles who mingled with them, or because of their lower type of moral and religious character. But there seems to be no sufficient reason for these suppositions. The Jews believed that, according to  Micah 5:2  , the birth of the Messiah would take place at Bethlehem, and nowhere else. Nathanael held the same opinion as his countrymen, and believed that the great \"good\" which they were all expecting could not come from Nazareth. This is probably what Nathanael meant. Moreover, there does not seem to be any evidence that the inhabitants of Galilee were in any respect inferior, or that a Galilean was held in contempt, in the time of our Lord. (See Dr. Merrill's Galilee in the Time of Christ.)    The population of this city (now about 10,000) in the time of Christ probably amounted to 15,000 or 20,000 souls.    \"The so-called 'Holy House' is a cave under the Latin church, which appears to have been originally a tank. The 'brow of the hill', site of the attempted precipitation, is probably the northern cliff: the traditional site has been shown since the middle ages at some distance to the south. None of the traditional sites are traceable very early, and they have no authority. The name Nazareth perhaps means 'a watch tower' (now en-Nasrah), but is connected in the New Testament with Netzer, 'a branch' ( Isaiah 4:2  ;  Jeremiah 23:5  ;  Zechariah 3:8  ;  6:12  ;  Matthew 2:23  ), Nazarene being quite a different word from Nazarite.\"",

                "Separated, generally supposed to be the Greek form of the Hebrew netser, a \u201cshoot\u201d or \u201csprout.\u201d Some, however, think that the name of the city must be connected with the name of the hill behind it, from which one of the finest prospects in Palestine is obtained, and accordingly they derive it from the Hebrew notserah, i.e., one guarding or watching, thus designating the hill which overlooks and thus guards an extensive region.\n\n This city is not mentioned in the Old Testament. It was the home of Joseph and Mary ([Luke 2:39](/luke#Luke.2.39)), and here the angel announced to the Virgin the birth of the Messiah (1:26-28). Here Jesus grew up from his infancy to manhood (4:16); and here he began his public ministry in the synagogue ([Matt. 13:54](/matt#Matt.13.54)), at which the people were so offended that they sought to cast him down from the precipice whereon their city was built ([Luke 4:29](/luke#Luke.4.29)). Twice they expelled him from their borders (4:16-29; [Matt. 13:54-58](/matt#Matt.13.54)); and he finally retired from the city, where he did not many mighty works because of their unbelief ([Matt. 13:58](/matt#Matt.13.58)), and took up his residence in Capernaum.\n\n Nazareth is situated among the southern ridges of Lebanon, on the steep slope of a hill, about 14 miles from the Sea of Galilee and about 6 west from Mount Tabor. It is identified with the modern village en-Nazirah, of six or ten thousand inhabitants. It lies \u201cas in a hollow cup\u201d lower down upon the hill than the ancient city. The main road for traffic between Egypt and the interior of Asia passed by Nazareth near the foot of Tabor, and thence northward to Damascus.\n\n It is supposed from the words of Nathanael in [John 1:46](/john#John.1.46) that the city of Nazareth was held in great disrepute, either because, it is said, the people of Galilee were a rude and less cultivated class, and were largely influenced by the Gentiles who mingled with them, or because of their lower type of moral and religious character. But there seems to be no sufficient reason for these suppositions. The Jews believed that, according to [Micah 5:2](/mic#Mic.5.2), the birth of the Messiah would take place at Bethlehem, and nowhere else. Nathanael held the same opinion as his countrymen, and believed that the great \u201cgood\u201d which they were all expecting could not come from Nazareth. This is probably what Nathanael meant. Moreover, there does not seem to be any evidence that the inhabitants of Galilee were in any respect inferior, or that a Galilean was held in contempt, in the time of our Lord.\n\n The population of this city (now about 10,000) in the time of Christ probably amounted to 15,000 or 20,000 souls.\n\n \u201cThe so-called \u2018Holy House\u2019 is a cave under the Latin church, which appears to have been originally a tank. The \u2018brow of the hill\u2019, site of the attempted precipitation, is probably the northern cliff: the traditional site has been shown since the middle ages at some distance to the south. None of the traditional sites are traceable very early, and they have no authority. The name Nazareth perhaps means \u2018a watch tower\u2019 (now en-Nasrah), but is connected in the New Testament with Netzer, \u2019a branch\u2019 ([Isa. 4:2](/isa#Isa.4.2); [Jer. 23:5](/jer#Jer.23.5); [Zech. 3:8](/zech#Zech.3.8); [6:12](/zech#Zech.6.12); [Matt. 2:23](/matt#Matt.2.23)), Nazarene being quite a different word from Nazarite.\u201d"

                "First mentioned in [Gen. 10:11](/gen#Gen.10.11), which is rendered in the Revised Version, \u201cHe [i.e., Nimrod] went forth into Assyria and builded Nineveh.\u201d It is not again noticed till the days of Jonah, when it is described ([Jonah 3:3](/jonah#Jonah.3.3); [4:11](/jonah#Jonah.4.11)) as a great and populous city, the flourishing capital of the Assyrian empire ([2 Kings 19:36](/2kgs#2Kgs.19.36); [Isa. 37:37](/isa#Isa.37.37)). The book of the prophet Nahum is almost exclusively taken up with prophetic denunciations against this city. Its ruin and utter desolation are foretold ([Nah. 1:14](/nah#Nah.1.14); [3:19](/nah#Nah.3.19), etc.). Zephaniah also (2:13-15) predicts its destruction along with the fall of the empire of which it was the capital. From this time there is no mention of it in Scripture till it is named in gospel history ([Matt. 12:41](/matt#Matt.12.41); [Luke 11:32](/luke#Luke.11.32)).\n\n This \u201cexceeding great city\u201d lay on the eastern or left bank of the river Tigris, along which it stretched for some 30 miles, having an average breadth of 10 miles or more from the river back toward the eastern hills. This whole extensive space is now one immense area of ruins. Occupying a central position on the great highway between the Mediterranean and the Indian Ocean, thus uniting the East and the West, wealth flowed into it from many sources, so that it became the greatest of all ancient cities.\n\n About B.C. 633 the Assyrian empire began to show signs of weakness, and Nineveh was attacked by the Medes, who subsequently, about B.C. 625, being joined by the Babylonians and Susianians, again attacked it, when it fell, and was razed to the ground. The Assyrian empire then came to an end, the Medes and Babylonians dividing its provinces between them. \u201cAfter having ruled for more than six hundred years with hideous tyranny and violence, from the Caucasus and the Caspian to the Persian Gulf, and from beyond the Tigris to Asia Minor and Egypt, it vanished like a dream\u201d ([Nah. 2:6-11](/nah#Nah.2.6)). Its end was strange, sudden, tragic. It was God\u2019s doing, his judgement on Assyria\u2019s pride ([Isa. 10:5-19](/isa#Isa.10.5)).\n\n Forty years ago our knowledge of the great Assyrian empire and of its magnificent capital was almost wholly a blank. Vague memories had indeed survived of its power and greatness, but very little was definitely known about it. Other cities which had perished, as Palmyra, Persepolis, and Thebes, had left ruins to mark their sites and tell of their former greatness; but of this city, imperial Nineveh, not a single vestige seemed to remain, and the very place on which it had stood was only matter of conjecture. In fulfilment of prophecy, God made \u201can utter end of the place.\u201d It became a \u201cdesolation.\u201d\n\n In the days of the Greek historian Herodotus, B.C. 400, it had become a thing of the past; and when Xenophon the historian passed the place in the \u201cRetreat of the Ten Thousand,\u201d the very memory of its name had been lost. It was buried out of sight, and no one knew its grave. It is never again to rise from its ruins.\n\n At length, after being lost for more than two thousand years, the city was disentombed. A little more than forty years ago the French consul at Mosul began to search the vast mounds that lay along the opposite bank of the river. The Arabs whom he employed in these excavations, to their great surprise, came upon the ruins of a building at the mound of Khorsabad, which, on further exploration, turned out to be the royal palace of Sargon, one of the Assyrian kings. They found their way into its extensive courts and chambers, and brought forth form its hidded depths many wonderful sculptures and other relics of those ancient times.\n\n The work of exploration has been carried on almost continuously by M. Botta, Sir Henry Layard, George Smith, and others, in the mounds of Nebi-Yunus, Nimrud, Koyunjik, and Khorsabad, and a vast treasury of specimens of old Assyrian art has been exhumed. Palace after palace has been discovered, with their decorations and their sculptured slabs, revealing the life and manners of this ancient people, their arts of war and peace, the forms of their religion, the style of their architecture, and the magnificence of their monarchs. The streets of the city have been explored, the inscriptions on the bricks and tablets and sculptured figures have been read, and now the secrets of their history have been brought to light.\n\n One of the most remarkable of recent discoveries is that of the library of King Assur-bani-pal, or, as the Greek historians call him, Sardanapalos, the grandson of Sennacherib (q.v.). This library consists of about ten thousand flat bricks or tablets, all written over with Assyrian characters. They contain a record of the history, the laws, and the religion of Assyria, of the greatest value. These strange clay leaves found in the royal library form the most valuable of all the treasuries of the literature of the old world. The library contains also old Accadian documents, which are the oldest extant documents in the world, dating as far back as probably about the time of Abraham.\n\n \u201cThe Assyrian royalty is, perhaps, the most luxurious of our century [reign of Assur-bani-pa]...Its victories and conquests, uninterrupted for one hundred years, have enriched it with the spoil of twenty peoples. Sargon has taken what remained to the Hittites; Sennacherib overcame Chaldea, and the treasures of Babylon were transferred to his coffers; Esarhaddon and Assur-bani-pal himself have pillaged Egypt and her great cities, Sais, Memphis, and Thebes of the hundred gates...Now foreign merchants flock into Nineveh, bringing with them the most valuable productions from all countries, gold and perfume from South Arabia and the Chaldean Sea, Egyptian linen and glass-work, carved enamels, goldsmiths\u2019 work, tin, silver, Phoenician purple; cedar wood from Lebanon, unassailable by worms; furs and iron from Asia Minor and Armenia\u201d (Ancient Egypt and Assyria, by G. Maspero, page 271).\n\n The bas-reliefs, alabaster slabs, and sculptured monuments found in these recovered palaces serve in a remarkable manner to confirm the Old Testament history of the kings of Israel. The appearance of the ruins shows that the destruction of the city was due not only to the assailing foe but also to the flood and the fire, thus confirming the ancient prophecies concerning it. \u201cThe recent excavations,\u201d says Rawlinson, \u201chave shown that fire was a great instrument in the destruction of the Nineveh palaces. Calcined alabaster, charred wood, and charcoal, colossal statues split through with heat, are met with in parts of the Nineveh mounds, and attest the veracity of prophecy.\u201d\n\n Nineveh in its glory was ([Jonah 3:4](/jonah#Jonah.3.4)) an \u201cexceeding great city of three days\u2019 journey\u201d, i.e., probably in circuit. This would give a circumference of about 60 miles. At the four corners of an irregular quadrangle are the ruins of Kouyunjik, Nimrud, Karamless and Khorsabad. These four great masses of ruins, with the whole area included within the parallelogram they form by lines drawn from the one to the other, are generally regarded as composing the whole ruins of Nineveh."

Here the tabernacle was then standing, and here Ahimelech the priest resided. From [Isa. 10:28-32](/isa#Isa.10.28) it seems to have been near Jerusalem. It has been identified by some with el-Isawiyeh, one mile and a half to the north-east of Jerusalem. But according to [Isa. 10:28-32](/isa#Isa.10.28) it was on the south of Geba, on the road to Jerusalem, and within sight of the city. This identification does not meet these conditions, and hence others (as Dean Stanley) think that it was the northern summit of Mount Olivet, the place where David \u201cworshipped God\u201d when fleeing from Absalom ([2 Sam. 15:32](/2sam#2Sam.15.32)), or more probably (Conder) that it was the same as Mizpeh (q.v.), [Judg. 20:1](/judg#Judg.20.1); [Josh. 18:26](/josh#Josh.18.26); [1 Sam. 7:16](/1sam#1Sam.7.16), at Nebi Samwil, about 5 miles north-west of Jerusalem.\n\n After being supplied with the sacred loaves of showbread, and girding on the sword of Goliath, which was brought forth from behind the ephod, David fled from Nob and sought refuge at the court of Achish, the king of Gath, where he was cast into prison.

            "dictionaryText": " so called from the olive trees with which its sides are clothed, is a mountain ridge on the east of Jerusalem ( 1 Kings 11:7  ;  Ezekiel 11:23  ;  Zechariah 14:4  ), from which it is separated by the valley of Kidron. It is first mentioned in connection with David's flight from Jerusalem through the rebellion of Absalom ( 2 Samuel 15:30  ), and is only once again mentioned in the Old Testament, in  Zechariah 14:4  . It is, however, frequently alluded to ( 1 Kings 11:7  ;  2  Kings   23:13  ;  Nehemiah 8:15  ;  Ezekiel 11:23  ).    It is frequently mentioned in the New Testament ( Matthew 21:1  ;  26:30  , etc.). It now bears the name of Jebel et-Tur, i.e., \"Mount of the Summit;\" also sometimes called Jebel ez-Zeitun, i.e., \"Mount of Olives.\" It is about 200 feet above the level of the city. The road from Jerusalem to Bethany runs as of old over this mount. It was on this mount that Jesus stood when he wept over Jerusalem. \"No name in Scripture,\" says Dr. Porter, \"calls up associations at once so sacred and so pleasing as that of Olivet. The 'mount' is so intimately connected with the private, the devotional life of the Saviour, that we read of it and look at it with feelings of deepest interest and affection. Here he often sat with his disciples, telling them of wondrous events yet to come, of the destruction of the Holy City; of the sufferings, the persecution, and the final triumph of his followers ( Matthew 24  ). Here he gave them the beautiful parables of the ten virgins and the five talents (25); here he was wont to retire on each evening for meditation, and prayer, and rest of body, when weary and harassed by the labours and trials of the day ( Luke 21:37  ); and here he came on the night of his betrayal to utter that wonderful prayer, 'O my Father, if it be possible, let this cup pass from me: nevertheless not as I will, but as thou wilt' ( Matthew 26:39  ). And when the cup of God's wrath had been drunk, and death and the grave conquered, he led his disciples out again over Olivet as far as to Bethany, and after a parting blessing ascended to heaven ( Luke 24:50  Luke 24:51  ;  Acts 1:12  ).\"    This mount, or rather mountain range, has four summits or peaks: (1) the \"Galilee\" peak, so called from a tradition that the angels stood here when they spoke to the disciples ( Acts 1:11  ); (2) the \"Mount of Ascension,\" the supposed site of that event, which was, however, somewhere probably nearer Bethany ( Luke 24:51  Luke 24:52  ); (3) the \"Prophets,\" from the catacombs on its side, called \"the prophets' tombs;\" and (4) the \"Mount of Corruption,\" so called because of the \"high places\" erected there by Solomon for the idolatrous worship of his foreign wives ( 1 Kings 11:7  ;  2  Kings   23:13  ; Vulg., \"Mount of Offence\").",

The Persians were originally a Medic tribe which settled in Persia, on the eastern side of the Persian Gulf. They were Aryans, their language belonging to the eastern division of the Indo-European group. One of their chiefs, Teispes, conquered Elam in the time of the decay of the Assyrian Empire, and established himself in the district of Anzan. His descendants branched off into two lines, one line ruling in Anzan, while the other remained in Persia. Cyrus II., king of Anzan, finally united the divided power, conquered Media, Lydia, and Babylonia, and carried his arms into the far East. His son, Cambyses, added Egypt to the empire, which, however, fell to pieces after his death. It was reconquered and thoroughly organized by Darius, the son of Hystaspes, whose dominions extended from India to the Danube."

This name is not found in the Old Testament, and in the New Testament it is mentioned only in the passages above referred to.    \"In the Egyptian inscriptions Phoenicia is called Keft, the inhabitants being Kefa; and since Keft-ur, or 'Greater Phoenicia,' was the name given to the delta of the Nile from the Phoenician colonies settled upon it, the Philistines who came from Caphtor or Keft-ur must have been of Phoenician origin\" (Compare  Deuteronomy 2:23  ;  Jeremiah 47:4  ;  Amos 9:7  )., Sayce's Bible and the Monuments.    Phoenicia lay in the very centre of the old world, and was the natural entrepot for commerce with foreign nations. It was the \"England of antiquity.\" \"The trade routes from all Asia converged on the Phoenician coast; the centres of commerce on the Euphrates and Tigris forwarding their goods by way of Tyre to the Nile, to Arabia, and to the west; and, on the other hand, the productions of the vast regions bordering the Mediterranean passing through the Canaanite capital to the eastern world.\" It was \"situate at the entry of the sea, a merchant of the people for many isles\" ( Ezekiel 27:3  Ezekiel 27:4  ). The far-reaching commercial activity of the Phoenicians, especially with Tarshish and the western world, enriched them with vast wealth, which introduced boundless luxury and developed among them a great activity in all manner of arts and manufactures. (See TYRE  .)   The Phoenicians were the most enterprising merchants of the old world, establishing colonies at various places, of which Carthage was the chief. They were a Canaanite branch of the race of Ham, and are frequently called Sidonians, from their principal city of Sidon. None could \"skill to hew timber like unto the Sidonians\" ( 1 Kings 5:6  ). King Hiram rendered important service to Solomon in connection with the planning and building of the temple, casting for him all the vessels for the temple service, and the two pillars which stood in the front of the porch, and \"the molten sea\" ( 1 Kings 7:21-23  ). Singular marks have been found by recent exploration on the great stones that form the substructure of the temple. These marks, both painted and engraved, have been regarded as made by the workmen in the quarries, and as probably intended to indicate the place of these stones in the building. \"The Biblical account ( 1 Kings 5:17  1 Kings 5:18  ) is accurately descriptive of the massive masonry now existing at the south-eastern angle (of the temple area), and standing on the native rock 80 feet below the present surface. The Royal Engineers found, buried deeply among the rubbish of many centuries, great stones, costly and hewed stones, forming the foundation of the sanctuary wall; while Phoenician fragments of pottery and Phoenician marks painted on the massive blocks seem to proclaim that the stones were prepared in the quarry by the cunning workmen of Hiram, the king of Tyre.\" (See TEMPLE  .)   The Phoenicians have been usually regarded as the inventors of alphabetic writing. The Egyptians expressed their thoughts by certain symbols, called \"hieroglyphics\", i.e., sacred carvings, so styled because used almost exclusively on sacred subjects. The recent discovery, however, of inscriptions in Southern Arabia (Yemen and Hadramaut), known as Hemyaritic, in connection with various philogical considerations, has led some to the conclusion that the Phoenician alphabet was derived from the Mineans (admitting the antiquity of the kingdom of Ma'in, Judg.  10:12  ;  2  Chr   26:7  ). Thus the Phoenician alphabet ceases to be the mother alphabet. Sayce thinks \"it is more than possible that the Egyptians themselves were emigrants from Southern Arabia.\" (See MOABITE  STONE .)   \"The Phoenicians were renowned in ancient times for the manufacture of glass, and some of the specimens of this work that have been preserved are still the wonder of mankind...In the matter of shipping, whether ship-building be thought of or traffic upon the sea, the Phoenicians surpassed all other nations.\" \"The name Phoenicia is of uncertain origin, though it may be derived from Fenkhu, the name given in the Egyptian inscriptions to the natives of Palestine. Among the chief Phoenician cities were Tyre and Sidon, Gebal north of Beirut, Arvad or Arados and Zemar.\" ",

                "([Acts 21:2](/acts#Acts.21.2)) = Phenice (11:19; 15:3; R.V., Phoenicia), Gr. phoinix, \u201ca palm\u201d, the land of palm-trees; a strip of land of an average breadth of about 20 miles along the shores of the Mediterranean, from the river Eleutherus in the north to the promotory of Carmel in the south, about 120 miles in length. This name is not found in the Old Testament, and in the New Testament it is mentioned only in the passages above referred to.\n\n \u201cIn the Egyptian inscriptions Phoenicia is called Keft, the inhabitants being Kefa; and since Keft-ur, or \u2018Greater Phoenicia,\u2019 was the name given to the delta of the Nile from the Phoenician colonies settled upon it, the Philistines who came from Caphtor or Keft-ur must have been of Phoenician origin\u201d (comp. [Deut. 2:23](/deut#Deut.2.23); [Jer. 47:4](/jer#Jer.47.4); [Amos 9:7](/amos#Amos.9.7))., Sayce\u2019s Bible and the Monuments.\n\n Phoenicia lay in the very centre of the old world, and was the natural entrepot for commerce with foreign nations. It was the \u201cEngland of antiquity.\u201d \u201cThe trade routes from all Asia converged on the Phoenician coast; the centres of commerce on the Euphrates and Tigris forwarding their goods by way of Tyre to the Nile, to Arabia, and to the west; and, on the other hand, the productions of the vast regions bordering the Mediterranean passing through the Canaanite capital to the eastern world.\u201d It was \u201csituate at the entry of the sea, a merchant of the people for many isles\u201d ([Ezek. 27:3](/ezek#Ezek.27.3), [4](/ezek#Ezek.27.4)). The far-reaching commercial activity of the Phoenicians, especially with Tarshish and the western world, enriched them with vast wealth, which introduced boundless luxury and developed among them a great activity in all manner of arts and manufactures.\n\n The Phoenicians were the most enterprising merchants of the old world, establishing colonies at various places, of which Carthage was the chief. They were a Canaanite branch of the race of Ham, and are frequently called Sidonians, from their principal city of Sidon. None could \u201cskill to hew timber like unto the Sidonians\u201d ([1 Kings 5:6](/1kgs#1Kgs.5.6)). King Hiram rendered important service to Solomon in connection with the planning and building of the temple, casting for him all the vessels for the temple service, and the two pillars which stood in the front of the porch, and \u201cthe molten sea\u201d ([1 Kings 7:21-23](/1kgs#1Kgs.7.21)). Singular marks have been found by recent exploration on the great stones that form the substructure of the temple. These marks, both painted and engraved, have been regarded as made by the workmen in the quarries, and as probably intended to indicate the place of these stones in the building. \u201cThe Biblical account ([1 Kings 5:17](/1kgs#1Kgs.5.17), [18](/1kgs#1Kgs.5.18)) is accurately descriptive of the massive masonry now existing at the south-eastern angle (of the temple area), and standing on the native rock 80 feet below the present surface. The Royal Engineers found, buried deeply among the rubbish of many centuries, great stones, costly and hewed stones, forming the foundation of the sanctuary wall; while Phoenician fragments of pottery and Phoenician marks painted on the massive blocks seem to proclaim that the stones were prepared in the quarry by the cunning workmen of Hiram, the king of Tyre.\u201d\n\n The Phoenicians have been usually regarded as the inventors of alphabetic writing. The Egyptians expressed their thoughts by certain symbols, called \u201chieroglyphics\u201d, i.e., sacred carvings, so styled because used almost exclusively on sacred subjects. The recent discovery, however, of inscriptions in Southern Arabia (Yemen and Hadramaut), known as Hemyaritic, in connection with various philogical considerations, has led some to the conclusion that the Phoenician alphabet was derived from the Mineans (admitting the antiquity of the kingdom of Ma\u2019in, [Judg. 10:12](/judg#Judg.10.12); [2 Chr. 26:7](/2chr#2Chr.26.7)). Thus the Phoenician alphabet ceases to be the mother alphabet. Sayce thinks \u201cit is more than possible that the Egyptians themselves were emigrants from Southern Arabia.\u201d\n\n \u201cThe Phoenicians were renowned in ancient times for the manufacture of glass, and some of the specimens of this work that have been preserved are still the wonder of mankind...In the matter of shipping, whether ship-building be thought of or traffic upon the sea, the Phoenicians surpassed all other nations.\u201d \u201cThe name Phoenicia is of uncertain origin, though it may be derived from Fenkhu, the name given in the Egyptian inscriptions to the natives of Palestine. Among the chief Phoenician cities were Tyre and Sidon, Gebal north of Beirut, Arvad or Arados and Zemar.\u201d"

Some have identified it with Ajrud, a fortress between Etham and Suez. The condition of the Isthmus of Suez at the time of the Exodus is not exactly known, and hence this, with the other places mentioned as encampments of Israel in Egypt, cannot be definitely ascertained. The isthmus has been formed by the Nile deposits. This increase of deposit still goes on, and so rapidly that within the last fifty years the mouth of the Nile has advanced northward about four geographical miles. In the maps of Ptolemy (of the second and third centuries A.D.) the mouths of the Nile are forty miles further south than at present."

It was probably the Patumos of the Greek historian Herodotus. It has now been satisfactorily identified with Tell-el-Maskhuta, about 12 miles west of Ismailia, and 20 east of Tel-el-Kebir, on the southern bank of the present Suez Canal. Here have recently (1883) been discovered the ruins of supposed grain-chambers, and other evidences to show that this was a great \u201cstore city.\u201d Its immense ruin-heaps show that it was built of bricks, and partly also of bricks without straw. Succoth ([Ex. 12:37](/exod#Exod.12.37)) is supposed by some to be the secular name of this city, Pithom being its sacred name. This was the first halting-place of the Israelites in their exodus. It has been argued (Dr. Lansing) that these \u201cstore\u201d cities \u201cwere residence cities, royal dwellings, such as the Pharaohs of old, the Kings of Israel, and our modern Khedives have ever loved to build, thus giving employment to the superabundant muscle of their enslaved peoples, and making a name for themselves.\u201d"

It enters the Jordan about 20 miles north of Jericho.\n\n The first historical notice of the Jordan is in the account of the separation of Abraham and Lot ([Gen. 13:10](/gen#Gen.13.10)). \u201cLot beheld the plain of Jordan as the garden of the Lord.\u201d Jacob crossed and recrossed \u201cthis Jordan\u201d (32:10). The Israelites passed over it as \u201con dry ground\u201d ([Josh. 3:17](/josh#Josh.3.17); [Ps. 114:3](/ps#Ps.114.3)). Twice afterwards its waters were miraculously divided at the same spot by Elijah and Elisha ([2 Kings 2:8](/2kgs#2Kgs.2.8), [14](/2kgs#2Kgs.2.14)).\n\n The Jordan is mentioned in the Old Testament about one hundred and eighty times, and in the New Testament fifteen times. The chief events in gospel history connected with it are (1) John the Baptist\u2019s ministry, when \u201cthere went out to him Jerusalem, and all Judaea, and were baptized of him in Jordan\u201d ([Matt. 3:6](/matt#Matt.3.6))."

After David had subdued all their allies in a great war, he sent Joab with a strong force to take their city. For two years it held out against its assailants. It was while his army was engaged in this protracted siege that David was guilty of that deed of shame which left a blot on his character and cast a gloom over the rest of his life. At length, having taken the \u201croyal city\u201d (or the \u201ccity of waters,\u201d [2 Sam. 12:27](/2sam#2Sam.12.27), i.e., the lower city on the river, as distinguished from the citadel), Joab sent for David to direct the final assault (11:1; 12:26-31). The city was given up to plunder, and the people were ruthlessly put to death, and \u201cthus did he with all the cities of the children of Ammon.\u201d The destruction of Rabbath was the last of David\u2019s conquests. His kingdom now reached its farthest limits ([2 Sam. 8:1-15](/2sam#2Sam.8.1); [1 Chr. 18:1-15](/1chr#1Chr.18.1)). The capture of this city is referred to by Amos (1:14), Jeremiah (49:2, 3), and Ezekiel (21:20; 25:5)."

Rahab; i.e., \u201cbroad,\u201d \u201clarge\u201d). When the Hebrews were encamped at Shittim, in the \u201cArabah\u201d or Jordan valley opposite Jericho, ready to cross the river, Joshua, as a final preparation, sent out two spies to \u201cspy the land.\u201d After five days they returned, having swum across the river, which at this season, the month Abib, overflowed its banks from the melting of the snow on Lebanon. The spies reported how it had fared with them ([Josh. 2:1-7](/josh#Josh.2.1)). They had been exposed to danger in Jericho, and had been saved by the fidelity of Rahab the harlot, to whose house they had gone for protection. When the city of Jericho fell (6:17-25), Rahab and her whole family were preserved according to the promise of the spies, and were incorporated among the Jewish people. She afterwards became the wife of Salmon, a prince of the tribe of Judah ([Ruth 4:21](/ruth#Ruth.4.21); [1 Chr. 2:11](/1chr#1Chr.2.11); [Matt. 1:5](/matt#Matt.1.5)). \u201cRahab\u2019s being asked to bring out the spies to the soldiers ([Josh. 2:3](/josh#Josh.2.3)) sent for them, is in strict keeping with Eastern manners, which would not permit any man to enter a woman\u2019s house without her permission. The fact of her covering the spies with bundles of flax which lay on her house-roof (2:6) is an \u2018undesigned coincidence\u2019 which strictly corroborates the narrative. It was the time of the barley harvest, and flax and barley are ripe at the same time in the Jordan valley, so that the bundles of flax stalks might have been expected to be drying just then\u201d (Geikie\u2019s Hours, etc., ii., 390)."

It is frequently mentioned in the history of that prophet and of David (15:34; 16:13; 19:18-23). Here Samuel died and was buried (25:1).\n\n This town has been identified with the modern Neby Samwil (\u201cthe prophet Samuel\u201d), about 4 or 5 miles north-west of Jerusalem.

It is connected with the Indian Ocean, of which it is an arm, by the Strait of Bab-el-Mandeb. At a point (Ras Mohammed) about 200 miles from its nothern extremity it is divided into two arms, that on the east called the AElanitic Gulf, now the Bahr el-'Akabah, about 100 miles long by 15 broad, and that on the west the Gulf of Suez, about 150 miles long by about 20 broad. This branch is now connected with the Mediterranean by the Suez Canal. Between these two arms lies the Sinaitic Peninsula.    The Hebrew name generally given to this sea is <i> Yam Suph</i> . This word <i> suph</i> means a woolly kind of sea-weed, which the sea casts up in great abundance on its shores. In these passages,  Exodus 10:19  ;  13:18  ;  Exodus 15:4  Exodus 15:22  ;  23:31  ;  Numbers 14:25  , etc., the Hebrew name is always translated \"Red Sea,\" which was the name given to it by the Greeks. The origin of this name (Red Sea) is uncertain. Some think it is derived from the red colour of the mountains on the western shore; others from the red coral found in the sea, or the red appearance sometimes given to the water by certain zoophytes floating in it. In the New Testament ( Acts 7:36  ;  Hebrews 11:29  ) this name is given to the Gulf of Suez.    This sea was also called by the Hebrews Yam-mitstraim, i.e., \"the Egyptian sea\" ( Isaiah 11:15  ), and simply Ha-yam, \"the sea\" ( Exodus 14:2  Exodus 14:9  Exodus 14:16  Exodus 14:21  Exodus 14:28  ;  Joshua 24:6  Joshua 24:7  ;  Isaiah 10:26  , etc.).    The great historical event connected with the Red Sea is the passage of the children of Israel, and the overthrow of the Egyptians, to which there is frequent reference in Scripture ( Exodus 1415 ,15;  Numbers 33:8  ;  Deuteronomy 11:4  ;  Joshua 2:10  ;  Judges 11:16  ;  2  Sam  22:16 ;  Nehemiah 9:9-11  ;  Psalms 66:6  ;  Isaiah 10:26  ;  Acts 7:36  , etc.).",

                "Supports, one of the stations of the Israelites, situated in the Wady Feiran, near its junction with the Wady esh-Sheikh. Here no water could be found for the people to drink, and in their impatience they were ready to stone Moses, as if he were the cause of their distress. At the command of God Moses smote \u201cthe rock in Horeb,\u201d and a copious stream flowed forth, enough for all the people. After this the Amalekites attacked the Israelites while they were here encamped, but they were utterly defeated ([Ex. 17:1](/exod#Exod.17.1), [8](/exod#Exod.17.8)-16). They were the \u201cfirst of the nations\u201d to make war against Israel ([Num. 24:20](/num#Num.24.20)).\n\n Leaving Rephidim, the Israelites advanced into the wilderness of Sinai ([Ex. 19:1](/exod#Exod.19.1), [2](/exod#Exod.19.2); [Num. 33:14](/num#Num.33.14), [15](/num#Num.33.15)), marching probably through the two passes of the Wady Solaf and the Wady esh-Sheikh, which converge at the entrance to the plain er-Rahah, the \u201cdesert of Sinai,\u201d which is two miles long and about half a mile broad."

It is described ([Num. 34:11](/num#Num.34.11)) as \u201con the eastern side of Ain.\u201d A place still called el Ain, i.e., \u201cthe fountain\u201d, is found in such a position about 10 miles distant."

Paul was brought to this city a prisoner, where he remained for two years ( Acts 28:30  Acts 28:31  ) \"in his own hired house.\" While here, Paul wrote his epistles to the Philippians, to the Ephesians, to the Colossians, to Philemon, and probably also to the Hebrews. He had during these years for companions Luke and Aristarchus ( Acts 27:2  ), Timothy (Phil  1:1  ;  Colossians 1:1  ), Tychicus ( Ephesians 6:  :  21 ), Epaphroditus (Phil  4:18  ), and John Mark ( Colossians 4:10  ). (See PAUL  .)   Beneath this city are extensive galleries, called \"catacombs,\" which were used from about the time of the apostles (one of the inscriptions found in them bears the date A.D. 71) for some three hundred years as places of refuge in the time of persecution, and also of worship and burial. About four thousand inscriptions have been found in the catacombs. These give an interesting insight into the history of the church at Rome down to the time of Constantine.",

                "The name given by Greek writers of the second century to that inland sea called in Scripture the \u201csalt sea\u201d ([Gen. 14:3](/gen#Gen.14.3); [Num. 34:12](/num#Num.34.12)), the \u201csea of the plain\u201d ([Deut. 3:17](/deut#Deut.3.17)), the \u201ceast sea\u201d ([Ezek. 47:18](/ezek#Ezek.47.18); [Joel 2:20](/joel#Joel.2.20)), and simply \u201cthe sea\u201d ([Ezek. 47:8](/ezek#Ezek.47.8)). The Arabs call it Bahr Lut, i.e., the Sea of Lot. It lies about 16 miles in a straight line to the east of Jerusalem. Its surface is 1,292 feet below the surface of the Mediterranean Sea. It covers an area of about 300 square miles. Its depth varies from 1,310 to 11 feet. From various phenomena that have been observed, its bottom appears to be still subsiding. It is about 53 miles long, and of an average breadth of 10 miles. It has no outlet, the great heat of that region causing such rapid evaporation that its average depth, notwithstanding the rivers that run into it, is maintained with little variation. The Jordan alone discharges into it no less than six million tons of water every twenty-four hours.\n\n The waters of the Dead Sea contain 24.6 per cent. of mineral salts, about seven times as much as in ordinary sea-water; thus they are unusually buoyant. Chloride of magnesium is most abundant; next to that chloride of sodium (common salt). But terraces of alluvial deposits in the deep valley of the Jordan show that formerly one great lake extended from the Waters of Merom to the foot of the watershed in the Arabah. The waters were then about 1,400 feet above the present level of the Dead Sea, or slightly above that of the Mediterranean, and at that time were much less salt.\n\n Nothing living can exist in this sea. \u201cThe fish carried down by the Jordan at once die, nor can even mussels or corals live in it; but it is a fable that no bird can fly over it, or that there are no living creatures on its banks. Dr. Tristram found on the shores three kinds of kingfishers, gulls, ducks, and grebes, which he says live on the fish which enter the sea in shoals, and presently die. He collected one hundred and eighteen species of birds, some new to science, on the shores, or swimming or flying over the waters. The cane-brakes which fringe it at some parts are the homes of about forty species of mammalia, several of them animals unknown in England; and innumerable tropical or semi-tropical plants perfume the atmosphere wherever fresh water can reach. The climate is perfect and most delicious, and indeed there is perhaps no place in the world where a sanatorium could be established with so much prospect of benefit as at Ain Jidi (Engedi).\u201d, Geikie\u2019s Hours, etc."

In the heart of the mountains of Israel, a few miles north-west of Shechem, stands the \"hill of Shomeron,\" a solitary mountain, a great \"mamelon.\" It is an oblong hill, with steep but not inaccessible sides, and a long flat top. Omri, the king of Israel, purchased this hill from Shemer its owner for two talents of silver, and built on its broad summit the city to which he gave the name of \"Shomeron\", i.e., Samaria, as the new capital of his kingdom instead of Tirzah ( 1 Kings 16:24  ). As such it possessed many advantages. Here Omri resided during the last six years of his reign. As the result of an unsuccessful war with Syria, he appears to have been obliged to grant to the Syrians the right to \"make streets in Samaria\", i.e., probably permission to the Syrian merchants to carry on their trade in the Israelite capital. This would imply the existence of a considerable Syrian population. \"It was the only great city of Palestine created by the sovereign. All the others had been already consecrated by patriarchal tradition or previous possession. But Samaria was the choice of Omri alone. He, indeed, gave to the city which he had built the name of its former owner, but its especial connection with himself as its founder is proved by the designation which it seems Samaria bears in Assyrian inscriptions, Beth-khumri ('the house or palace of Omri').\", Stanley.    Samaria was frequently besieged. In the days of Ahab, Benhadad II. came up against it with thirty-two vassal kings, but was defeated with a great slaughter ( 1 Kings 20:1-21  ). A second time, next year, he assailed it; but was again utterly routed, and was compelled to surrender to Ahab ( 20:28-34  ), whose army, as compared with that of Benhadad, was no more than \"two little flocks of kids.\"    In the days of Jehoram this Benhadad again laid siege to Samaria, during which the city was reduced to the direst extremities. But just when success seemed to be within their reach, they suddenly broke up the seige, alarmed by a mysterious noise of chariots and horses and a great army, and fled, leaving their camp with all its contents behind them. The famishing inhabitants of the city were soon relieved with the abundance of the spoil of the Syrian camp; and it came to pass, according to the word of Elisha, that \"a measure of fine flour was sold for a shekel, and two measures of barely for a shekel, in the gates of Samaria\" ( 2 Kings 7:1-20  ).    Shalmaneser invaded Israel in the days of Hoshea, and reduced it to vassalage. He laid siege to Samaria (B.C. 723), which held out for three years, and was at length captured by Sargon, who completed the conquest Shalmaneser had begun ( 2 Kings 18:9-12  ;  17:3  ), and removed vast numbers of the tribes into captivity. (See SARGON  .)   This city, after passing through various vicissitudes, was given by the emperor Augustus to Herod the Great, who rebuilt it, and called it Sebaste (Gr. form of Augustus) in honour of the emperor. In the New Testament the only mention of it is in  Acts 8:5-14  , where it is recorded that Philip went down to the city of Samaria and preached there.    It is now represented by the hamlet of Sebustieh, containing about three hundred inhabitants. The ruins of the ancient town are all scattered over the hill, down the sides of which they have rolled. The shafts of about one hundred of what must have been grand Corinthian columns are still standing, and attract much attention, although nothing definite is known regarding them. (Compare  Micah 1:6  .)    In the time of Christ, Western Palestine was divided into three provinces, Judea, Samaria, and Galilee. Samaria occupied the centre of Palestine ( John 4:4  ). It is called in the Talmud the \"land of the Cuthim,\" and is not regarded as a part of the Holy Land at all.    It may be noticed that the distance between Samaria and Jerusalem, the respective capitals of the two kingdoms, is only 35 miles in a direct line.",

                "A watch-mountain or a watch-tower. In the heart of the mountains of Israel, a few miles north-west of Shechem, stands the \u201chill of Shomeron,\u201d a solitary mountain, a great \u201cmamelon.\u201d It is an oblong hill, with steep but not inaccessible sides, and a long flat top. Omri, the king of Israel, purchased this hill from Shemer its owner for two talents of silver, and built on its broad summit the city to which he gave the name of \u201cShomeron\u201d, i.e., Samaria, as the new capital of his kingdom instead of Tirzah ([1 Kings 16:24](/1kgs#1Kgs.16.24)). As such it possessed many advantages. Here Omri resided during the last six years of his reign. As the result of an unsuccessful war with Syria, he appears to have been obliged to grant to the Syrians the right to \u201cmake streets in Samaria\u201d, i.e., probably permission to the Syrian merchants to carry on their trade in the Israelite capital. This would imply the existence of a considerable Syrian population. \u201cIt was the only great city of Palestine created by the sovereign. All the others had been already consecrated by patriarchal tradition or previous possession. But Samaria was the choice of Omri alone. He, indeed, gave to the city which he had built the name of its former owner, but its especial connection with himself as its founder is proved by the designation which it seems Samaria bears in Assyrian inscriptions, Beth-khumri (\u2018the house or palace of Omri\u2019).\u201d, Stanley.\n\n Samaria was frequently besieged. In the days of Ahab, Benhadad II. came up against it with thirty-two vassal kings, but was defeated with a great slaughter ([1 Kings 20:1-21](/1kgs#1Kgs.20.1)). A second time, next year, he assailed it; but was again utterly routed, and was compelled to surrender to Ahab (20:28-34), whose army, as compared with that of Benhadad, was no more than \u201ctwo little flocks of kids.\u201d\n\n In the days of Jehoram this Benhadad again laid siege to Samaria, during which the city was reduced to the direst extremities. But just when success seemed to be within their reach, they suddenly broke up the seige, alarmed by a mysterious noise of chariots and horses and a great army, and fled, leaving their camp with all its contents behind them. The famishing inhabitants of the city were soon relieved with the abundance of the spoil of the Syrian camp; and it came to pass, according to the word of Elisha, that \u201ca measure of fine flour was sold for a shekel, and two measures of barely for a shekel, in the gates of Samaria\u201d ([2 Kings 7:1-20](/2kgs#2Kgs.7.1)).\n\n Shalmaneser invaded Israel in the days of Hoshea, and reduced it to vassalage. He laid siege to Samaria (B.C. 723), which held out for three years, and was at length captured by Sargon, who completed the conquest Shalmaneser had begun ([2 Kings 18:9-12](/2kgs#2Kgs.18.9); [17:3](/2kgs#2Kgs.17.3)), and removed vast numbers of the tribes into captivity.\n\n This city, after passing through various vicissitudes, was given by the emperor Augustus to Herod the Great, who rebuilt it, and called it Sebaste (Gr. form of Augustus) in honour of the emperor.

                "John (6:1; 21:1) calls it the \u201csea of Tiberias\u201d (q.v.). The modern Arabs retain this name, Bahr Tabariyeh.\n\n This lake is 12 1/2 miles long, and from 4 to 7 1/2 broad. Its surface is 682 feet below the level of the Mediterranean. Its depth is from 80 to 160 feet. The Jordan enters it 10 1/2 miles below the southern extremity of the Huleh Lake, or about 26 1/2 miles from its source. In this distance of 26 1/2 miles there is a fall in the river of 1,682 feet, or of more than 60 feet to the mile. It is 27 miles east of the Mediterranean, and about 60 miles north-east of Jerusalem. It is of an oval shape, and abounds in fish.\n\n Its present appearance is thus described: \u201cThe utter loneliness and absolute stillness of the scene are exceedingly impressive. It seems as if all nature had gone to rest, languishing under the scorching heat. How different it was in the days of our Lord! Then all was life and bustle along the shores; the cities and villages that thickly studded them resounded with the hum of a busy population; while from hill-side and corn-field came the cheerful cry of shepherd and ploughman. The lake, too, was dotted with dark fishing-boats and spangled with white sails. Now a mournful, solitary silence reigns over sea and shore. The cities are in ruins!\u201d\n\n This sea is chiefly of interest as associated with the public ministry of our Lord. Capernaum, \u201chis own city\u201d ([Matt. 9:1](/matt#Matt.9.1)), stood on its shores. From among the fishermen who plied their calling on its waters he chose Peter and his brother Andrew, and James and John, to be disciples, and sent them forth to be \u201cfishers of men\u201d ([Matt. 4:18](/matt#Matt.4.18), [22](/matt#Matt.4.22); [Mark 1:16-20](/mark#Mark.1.16); [Luke 5](/luke#Luke.5): 1-11). He stilled its tempest, saying to the storm that swept over it, \u201cPeace, be still\u201d ([Matt. 8:23-27](/matt#Matt.8.23); [Mark 7:31-35](/mark#Mark.7.31)); and here also he showed himself after his resurrection to his disciples ([John 21](/john#John.21)).\n\n \u201cThe Sea of Galilee is indeed the cradle of the gospel. The subterranean fires of nature prepared a lake basin, through which a river afterwards ran, keeping its waters always fresh. In this basin a vast quantity of shell-fish swarmed, and multiplied to such an extent that they formed the food of an extraordinary profusion of fish. The great variety and abundance of the fish in the lake attracted to its shores a larger and more varied population than existed elsewhere in Palestine, whereby this secluded district was brought into contact with all parts of the world. And this large and varied population, with access to all nations and countries, attracted the Lord Jesus, and induced him to make this spot the centre of his public ministry.\u201d"

                "A city in Samaria ([Gen. 33:18](/gen#Gen.33.18)), called also Sichem (12:6), Sychem ([Acts 7:16](/acts#Acts.7.16)). It stood in the narrow sheltered valley between Ebal on the north and Gerizim on the south, these mountains at their base being only some 500 yards apart. Here Abraham pitched his tent and built his first altar in the Promised Land, and received the first divine promise ([Gen. 12:6](/gen#Gen.12.6), [7](/gen#Gen.12.7)). Here also Jacob \u201cbought a parcel of a field at the hands of the children of Hamor\u201d after his return from Mesopotamia, and settled with his household, which he purged from idolatry by burying the teraphim of his followers under an oak tree, which was afterwards called \u201cthe oak of the sorcerer\u201d ([Gen. 33:19](/gen#Gen.33.19); [35:4](/gen#Gen.35.4); [Judg. 9:37](/judg#Judg.9.37)). Here too, after a while, he dug a well, which bears his name to this day ([John 4:5](/john#John.4.5), [39-42](/john#John.4.39)). To Shechem Joshua gathered all Israel \u201cbefore God,\u201d and delivered to them his second parting address ([Josh. 24:1-15](/josh#Josh.24.1)). He \u201cmade a covenant with the people that day\u201d at the very place where, on first entering the land, they had responded to the law from Ebal and Gerizim ([Josh. 24:25](/josh#Josh.24.25)), the terms of which were recorded \u201cin the book of the law of God\u201d, i.e., in the roll of the law of Moses; and in memory of this solemn transaction a great stone was set up \u201cunder an oak\u201d (comp. [Gen. 28:18](/gen#Gen.28.18); [31:44-48](/gen#Gen.31.44); [Ex. 24:4](/exod#Exod.24.4); [Josh. 4:3](/josh#Josh.4.3), [8](/josh#Josh.4.8), [9](/josh#Josh.4.9)), possibly the old \u201coak of Moreh,\u201d as a silent witness of the transaction to all coming time.\n\n Shechem became one of the cities of refuge, the central city of refuge for Western Palestine ([Josh. 20:7](/josh#Josh.20.7)), and here the bones of Joseph were buried (24:32). Rehoboam was appointed king in Shechem ([1 Kings 12:1](/1kgs#1Kgs.12.1), [19](/1kgs#1Kgs.12.19)), but Jeroboam afterwards took up his residence here. This city is mentioned in connection with our Lord\u2019s conversation with the woman of Samaria ([John 4:5](/john#John.4.5)); and thus, remaining as it does to the present day, it is one of the oldest cities of the world. It is the modern Nablus, a contraction for Neapolis, the name given to it by Vespasian. It lies about a mile and a half up the valley on its southern slope, and on the north of Gerizim, which rises about 1,100 feet above it, and is about 34 miles north of Jerusalem. It contains about 10,000 inhabitants, of whom about 160 are Samaritans and 100 Jews, the rest being Christians and Mohammedans.\n\n The site of Shechem is said to be of unrivalled beauty. Stanley says it is \u201cthe most beautiful, perhaps the only very beautiful, spot in Central Palestine.\u201d\n\n Gaza, near Shechem, only mentioned [1 Chr. 7:28](/1chr#1Chr.7.28), has entirely disappeared. It was destroyed at the time of the Conquest, and its place was taken by Shechem."

Shinar was apparently first peopled by Turanian tribes, who tilled the land and made bricks and built cities. Then tribes of Semites invaded the land and settled in it, and became its rulers. This was followed in course of time by an Elamite invasion; from which the land was finally delivered by Khammurabi, the son of Amarpel (\u201cAmraphel, king of Shinar,\u201d [Gen. 14:1](/gen#Gen.14.1)), who became the founder of the new empire of Chaldea."

                "A fishery, a town on the Mediterranean coast, about 25 miles north of Tyre. It received its name from the \u201cfirst-born\u201d of Canaan, the grandson of Noah ([Gen. 10:15](/gen#Gen.10.15), [19](/gen#Gen.10.19)). It was the first home of the Phoenicians on the coast of Palestine, and from its extensive commercial relations became a \u201cgreat\u201d city ([Josh. 11:8](/josh#Josh.11.8); [19:28](/josh#Josh.19.28)). It was the mother city of Tyre. It lay within the lot of the tribe of Asher, but was never subdued ([Judg. 1:31](/judg#Judg.1.31)). The Zidonians long oppressed Israel ([Judg. 10:12](/judg#Judg.10.12)). From the time of David its glory began to wane, and Tyre, its \u201cvirgin daughter\u201d ([Isa. 23:12](/isa#Isa.23.12)), rose to its place of pre-eminence. Solomon entered into a matrimonial alliance with the Zidonians, and thus their form of idolatrous worship found a place in the land of Israel ([1 Kings 11:1](/1kgs#1Kgs.11.1), [33](/1kgs#1Kgs.11.33)). This city was famous for its manufactures and arts, as well as for its commerce ([1 Kings 5:6](/1kgs#1Kgs.5.6); [1 Chr. 22:4](/1chr#1Chr.22.4); [Ezek. 27:8](/ezek#Ezek.27.8)). It is frequently referred to by the prophets ([Isa. 23:2](/isa#Isa.23.2), [4](/isa#Isa.23.4), [12](/isa#Isa.23.12); [Jer. 25:22](/jer#Jer.25.22); [27:3](/jer#Jer.27.3); [47:4](/jer#Jer.47.4); [Ezek. 27:8](/ezek#Ezek.27.8); [28:21](/ezek#Ezek.28.21), [22](/ezek#Ezek.28.22); [32:30](/ezek#Ezek.32.30); [Joel 3:4](/joel#Joel.3.4)). Our Lord visited the \u201ccoasts\u201d of Tyre and Zidon = Sidon (q.v.), [Matt. 15:21](/matt#Matt.15.21); [Mark 7:24](/mark#Mark.7.24); [Luke 4:26](/luke#Luke.4.26); and from this region many came forth to hear him preaching ([Mark 3:8](/mark#Mark.3.8); [Luke 6:17](/luke#Luke.6.17)). From Sidon, at which the ship put in after leaving Caesarea, Paul finally sailed for Rome ([Acts 27:3](/acts#Acts.27.3), [4](/acts#Acts.27.4)).\n\n This city is now a town of 10,000 inhabitants, with remains of walls built in the twelfth century A.D. In 1855, the sarcophagus of Eshmanezer was discovered. From a Phoenician inscription on its lid, it appears that he was a \u201cking of the Sidonians,\u201d probably in the third century B.C., and that his mother was a priestess of Ashtoreth, \u201cthe goddess of the Sidonians.\u201d In this inscription Baal is mentioned as the chief god of the Sidonians."

                "Sent or sending. Here a notable miracle was wrought by our Lord in giving sight to the blind ([John 9:7-11](/john#John.9.7)). It has been identified with the Birket Silwan in the lower Tyropoeon valley, to the south-east of the hill of Zion.\n\n The water which flows into this pool intermittingly by a subterranean channel springs from the \u201cFountain of the Virgin\u201d (q.v.). The length of this channel, which has several windings, is 1,750 feet, though the direct distance is only 1,100 feet. The pool is 53 feet in length from north to south, 18 feet wide, and 19 deep. The water passes from it by a channel cut in the rock into the gardens below.\n\n Many years ago (1880) a youth, while wading up the conduit by which the water enters the pool, accidentally discovered an inscription cut in the rock, on the eastern side, about 19 feet from the pool. This is the oldest extant Hebrew record of the kind. It has with great care been deciphered by scholars, and has been found to be an account of the manner in which the tunnel was constructed. Its whole length is said to be \u201ctwelve hundred cubits;\u201d and the inscription further notes that the workmen, like the excavators of the Mont Cenis Tunnel, excavated from both ends, meeting in the middle.\n\n Some have argued that the inscription was cut in the time of Solomon; others, with more probability, refer it to the reign of Hezekiah. A more ancient tunnel was discovered in 1889 some 20 feet below the ground. It is of smaller dimensions, but more direct in its course. It is to this tunnel that Isaiah (8:6) probably refers.\n\n The Siloam inscription above referred to was surreptitiously cut from the wall of the tunnel in 1891 and broken into fragments. These were, however, recovered by the efforts of the British Consul at Jerusalem, and have been restored to their original place."

This was probably the narrow plain of el-Markha, which stretches along the eastern shore of the Red Sea for several miles toward the promontory of Ras Mohammed, the southern extremity of the Sinitic Peninsula. While the Israelites rested here for some days they began to murmur on account of the want of nourishment, as they had by this time consumed all the corn they had brought with them out of Egypt.

                "Of Sin (the moon god), called also Horeb, the name of the mountain district which was reached by the Hebrews in the third month after the Exodus. Here they remained encamped for about a whole year. Their journey from the Red Sea to this encampment, including all the windings of the route, was about 150 miles. The last twenty-two chapters of Exodus, together with the whole of Leviticus and Num. ch. 1-11, contain a record of all the transactions which occurred while they were here. From Rephidim ([Ex. 17:8-13](/exod#Exod.17.8)) the Israelites journeyed forward through the Wady Solaf and Wady esh-Sheikh into the plain of er-Rahah, \u201cthe desert of Sinai,\u201d about 2 miles long and half a mile broad, and encamped there \u201cbefore the mountain.\u201d The part of the mountain range, a protruding lower bluff, known as the Ras Sasafeh (Sufsafeh), rises almost perpendicularly from this plain, and is in all probability the Sinai of history. Dean Stanley thus describes the scene:, \u201cThe plain itself is not broken and uneven and narrowly shut in, like almost all others in the range, but presents a long retiring sweep, within which the people could remove and stand afar off. The cliff, rising like a huge altar in front of the whole congregation, and visible against the sky in lonely grandeur from end to end of the whole plain, is the very image of the \u2018mount that might be touched,\u2019 and from which the voice of God might be heard far and wide over the plain below.\u201d This was the scene of the giving of the law. From the Ras Sufsafeh the law was proclaimed to the people encamped below in the plain of er-Rahah. During the lengthened period of their encampment here the Israelites passed through a very memorable experience. An immense change passed over them. They are now an organized nation, bound by covenant engagement to serve the Lord their God, their ever-present divine Leader and Protector. At length, in the second month of the second year of the Exodus, they move their camp and march forward according to a prescribed order. After three days they reach the \u201cwilderness of Paran,\u201d the \u201cet-Tih\u201d, i.e., \u201cthe desert\u201d, and here they make their first encampment. At this time a spirit of discontent broke out amongst them, and the Lord manifested his displeasure by a fire which fell on the encampment and inflicted injury on them. Moses called the place Taberah (q.v.), [Num. 11:1-3](/num#Num.11.1). The journey between Sinai and the southern boundary of the Promised Land (about 150 miles) at Kadesh was accomplished in about a year."

The wickedness of its inhabitants brought down upon it fire from heaven, by which it was destroyed (18:16-33; 19:1-29; [Deut. 23:17](/deut#Deut.23.17)). This city and its awful destruction are frequently alluded to in Scripture ([Deut. 29:23](/deut#Deut.29.23); [32:32](/deut#Deut.32.32); [Isa. 1:9](/isa#Isa.1.9), [10](/isa#Isa.1.10); 3:9; 13:19; [Jer. 23:14](/jer#Jer.23.14); [Ezek. 16:46-56](/ezek#Ezek.16.46); [Zeph. 2:9](/zeph#Zeph.2.9); [Matt. 10:15](/matt#Matt.10.15); [Rom. 9:29](/rom#Rom.9.29); 2 Pet. 2:6, etc.). No trace of it or of the other cities of the plain has been discovered, so complete was their destruction. Just opposite the site of Zoar, on the south-west coast of the Dead Sea, is a range of low hills, forming a mass of mineral salt called Jebel Usdum, \u201cthe hill of Sodom.\u201d It has been concluded, from this and from other considerations, that the cities of the plain stood at the southern end of the Dead Sea. Others, however, with much greater probability, contend that they stood at the northern end of the sea. [in 1897]."

Here Jacob ([Gen. 32:17](/gen#Gen.32.17), [30](/gen#Gen.32.30); 33:17), on his return from Padan-aram after his interview with Esau, built a house for himself and made booths for his cattle. The princes of this city churlishly refused to afford help to Gideon and his 300 men when \u201cfaint yet pursuing\u201d they followed one of the bands of the fugitive Midianites after the great victory at Gilboa. After overtaking and routing this band at Karkor, Gideon on his return visited the rulers of the city with severe punishment. \u201cHe took the elders of the city, and thorns of the wilderness and briers, and with them he taught the men of Succoth\u201d ([Judg. 8:13-16](/judg#Judg.8.13)). At this place were erected the foundries for casting the metal-work for the temple ([1 Kings 7:46](/1kgs#1Kgs.7.46))."

Once a magnificent city, it is now an immense mass of ruins. Here Daniel saw one of his visions ([Dan. 8](/dan#Dan.8)); and here also Nehemiah ([Neh. 1](/neh#Neh.1)) began his public life. Most of the events recorded in the Book of Esther took place here. Modern explorers have brought to light numerous relics, and the ground-plan of the splendid palace of Shushan, one of the residences of the great king, together with numerous specimens of ancient art, which illustrate the statements of Scripture regarding it ([Dan. 8:2](/dan#Dan.8.2)). The great hall of this palace ([Esther 1](/esth#Esth.1)) \u201cconsisted of several magnificent groups of columns, together with a frontage of 343 feet 9 inches, and a depth of 244 feet. These groups were arranged into a central phalanx of thirty-six columns (six rows of six each), flanked on the west, north, and east by an equal number, disposed in double rows of six each, and distant from them 64 feet 2 inches.\u201d The inscriptions on the ruins represent that the palace was founded by Darius and completed by Artaxerxes."

Mesopotamia is called ( Genesis 24:10  ;  Deuteronomy 23:4  ) Aram-naharain (=Syria of the two rivers), also Padan-aram ( Genesis 25:20  ). Other portions of Syria were also known by separate names, as Aram-maahah ( 1 Chronicles 19:6  ), Aram-beth-rehob ( 2 Samuel 10:6  ), Aram-zobah ( 2 Samuel 10:6  2 Samuel 10:8  ). All these separate little kingdoms afterwards became subject to Damascus. In the time of the Romans, Syria included also a part of Palestine and Asia Minor.    \"From the historic annals now accessible to us, the history of Syria may be divided into three periods: The first, the period when the power of the Pharaohs was dominant over the fertile fields or plains of Syria and the merchant cities of Tyre and Sidon, and when such mighty conquerors as Thothmes III. and Rameses II. could claim dominion and levy tribute from the nations from the banks of the Euphrates to the borders of the Libyan desert. Second, this was followed by a short period of independence, when the Jewish nation in the south was growing in power, until it reached its early zenith in the golden days of Solomon; and when Tyre and Sidon were rich cities, sending their traders far and wide, over land and sea, as missionaries of civilization, while in the north the confederate tribes of the Hittites held back the armies of the kings of Assyria. The third, and to us most interesting, period is that during which the kings of Assyria were dominant over the plains of Syria; when Tyre, Sidon, Ashdod, and Jerusalem bowed beneath the conquering armies of Shalmaneser, Sargon, and Sennacherib; and when at last Memphis and Thebes yielded to the power of the rulers of Nineveh and Babylon, and the kings of Assyria completed with terrible fulness the bruising of the reed of Egypt so clearly foretold by the Hebrew prophets.\", Boscawen.

It was here that Barak encamped before the battle with Sisera (q.v.) [Judg. 4:6-14](/judg#Judg.4.6). There is an old tradition, which, however, is unfounded, that it was the scene of the transfiguration of our Lord. \u201cThe prominence and isolation of Tabor, standing, as it does, on the border-land between the northern and southern tribes, between the mountains and the central plain, made it a place of note in all ages, and evidently led the psalmist to associate it with Hermon, the one emblematic of the south, the other of the north.\u201d There are some who still hold that this was the scene of the transfiguration (q.v.)."

                "The name of a place which first comes into notice in the days of Solomon. The question as to the locality of Tarshish has given rise to not a little discussion. Some think there was a Tarshish in the East, on the Indian coast, seeing that \u201cships of Tarshish\u201d sailed from Eziongeber, on the Red Sea ([1 Kings 9:26](/1kgs#1Kgs.9.26); [22:48](/1kgs#1Kgs.22.48); [2 Chr. 9:21](/2chr#2Chr.9.21)). Some, again, argue that Carthage was the place so named. There can be little doubt, however, that this is the name of a Phoenician port in Spain, between the two mouths of the Guadalquivir (the name given to the river by the Arabs, and meaning \u201cthe great wady\u201d or water-course). It was founded by a Carthaginian colony, and was the farthest western harbour of Tyrian sailors. It was to this port Jonah\u2019s ship was about to sail from Joppa. It has well been styled \u201cthe Peru of Tyrian adventure;\u201d it abounded in gold and silver mines.\n\n It appears that this name also is used without reference to any locality. \u201cShips of Tarshish\u201d is an expression sometimes denoting simply ships intended for a long voyage ([Isa. 23:1](/isa#Isa.23.1), [14](/isa#Isa.23.14)), ships of a large size (sea-going ships), whatever might be the port to which they sailed. Solomon\u2019s ships were so styled ([1 Kings 10:22](/1kgs#1Kgs.10.22); [22:49](/1kgs#1Kgs.22.49))."

                "Pitching of tents; fastening down, a town of Judah, about 12 miles south of Jerusalem, and visible from the city. From this place Joab procured a \u201cwise woman,\u201d who pretended to be in great affliction, and skilfully made her case known to David. Her address to the king was in the form of an apologue, similar to that of Nathan ([2 Sam. 12:1-6](/2sam#2Sam.12.1)). The object of Joab was, by the intervention of this woman, to induce David to bring back Absalom to Jerusalem ([2 Sam. 14:2](/2sam#2Sam.14.2), [4](/2sam#2Sam.14.4), [9](/2sam#2Sam.14.9)).\n\n This was also the birth-place of the prophet Amos (1:1).\n\n It is now the village of Teku\u2019a, on the top of a hill among ruins, 5 miles south of Bethlehem, and close to Beth-haccerem (\u201cHerod\u2019s mountain\u201d)."

                "A city, the modern Tubarich, on the western shore of the Sea of Tiberias. It is said to have been founded by Herod Antipas (A.D. 16), on the site of the ruins of an older city called Rakkath, and to have been thus named by him after the Emperor Tiberius. It is mentioned only three times in the history of our Lord ([John 6:1](/john#John.6.1), [23](/john#John.6.23); 21:1).\n\n In 1837 about one-half of the inhabitants perished by an earthquake. The population of the city is now about six thousand, nearly the one-half being Jews. \u201cWe do not read that our Lord ever entered this city. The reason of this is probably to be found in the fact that it was practically a heathen city, though standing upon Jewish soil. Herod, its founder, had brought together the arts of Greece, the idolatry of Rome, and the gross lewdness of Asia. There were in it a theatre for the performance of comedies, a forum, a stadium, a palace roofed with gold in imitation of those in Italy, statues of the Roman gods, and busts of the deified emperors. He who was not sent but to the lost sheep of the house of Israel might well hold himself aloof from such scenes as these\u201d (Manning\u2019s Those Holy Fields).\n\n After the fall of Jerusalem (A.D. 70), Tiberias became one of the chief residences of the Jews in Palestine. It was for more than three hundred years their metropolis. From about A.D. 150 the Sanhedrin settled here, and established rabbinical schools, which rose to great celebrity. Here the Jerusalem (or Palestinian) Talmud was compiled about the beginning of the fifth century. To this same rabbinical school also we are indebted for the Masora, a \u201cbody of traditions which transmitted the readings of the Hebrew text of the Old Testament, and preserved, by means of the vowel-system, the pronunciation of the Hebrew.\u201d In its original form, and in all manuscripts, the Hebrew is written without vowels; hence, when it ceased to be a spoken language, the importance of knowing what vowels to insert between the consonants. This is supplied by the Masora, and hence these vowels are called the \u201cMasoretic vowel-points.\u201d"

It remained the chief residence of the kings of Israel till Omri took Samaria ([1 Kings 14:17](/1kgs#1Kgs.14.17); [15:21](/1kgs#1Kgs.15.21); [16:6](/1kgs#1Kgs.16.6), [8](/1kgs#1Kgs.16.8), etc.).

Solomon refers to its beauty ([Cant. 6:4](/song#Song.6.4)). It has been identified with the modern mud hamlet Teiasir, 11 miles north of Shechem.

Josephus, the Jewish historian (Ant. 8:13, 2), however, supposes that Tishbi was some place in the land of Gilead. It has been identified by some with el-Ishtib, a some place 22 miles due south of the Sea of Galilee, among the mountains of Gilead."

            "dictionaryText": " a rock, now es-Sur; an ancient Phoenician city, about 23 miles, in a direct line, north of Acre, and 20 south of Sidon. Sidon was the oldest Phoenician city, but Tyre had a longer and more illustrious history. The commerce of the whole world was gathered into the warehouses of Tyre. \"Tyrian merchants were the first who ventured to navigate the Mediterranean waters; and they founded their colonies on the coasts and neighbouring islands of the AEgean Sea, in Greece, on the northern coast of Africa, at Carthage and other places, in Sicily and Corsica, in Spain at Tartessus, and even beyond the pillars of Hercules at Gadeira (Cadiz)\" (Driver's Isaiah). In the time of David a friendly alliance was entered into between the Hebrews and the Tyrians, who were long ruled over by their native kings ( 2 Samuel 5:11  ;  1 Kings 5:1  ;  2  Chr  2:3  ).    Tyre consisted of two distinct parts, a rocky fortress on the mainland, called \"Old Tyre,\" and the city, built on a small, rocky island about half-a-mile distant from the shore. It was a place of great strength. It was besieged by Shalmaneser, who was assisted by the Phoenicians of the mainland, for five years, and by Nebuchadnezzar (B.C. 586-573) for thirteen years, apparently without success. It afterwards fell under the power of Alexander the Great, after a siege of seven months, but continued to maintain much of its commercial importance till the Christian era. It is referred to in  Matthew 11:21   and  Acts 12:20  . In A.D. 1291 it was taken by the Saracens, and has remained a desolate ruin ever since.    \"The purple dye of Tyre had a worldwide celebrity on account of the durability of its beautiful tints, and its manufacture proved a source of abundant wealth to the inhabitants of that city.\"   Both Tyre and Sidon \"were crowded with glass-shops, dyeing and weaving establishments; and among their cunning workmen not the least important class were those who were celebrated for the engraving of precious stones.\" ( 2 Chronicles 2:7  2 Chronicles 2:14  ).    The wickedness and idolatry of this city are frequently denounced by the prophets, and its final destruction predicted ( Isaiah 23:1  ;  Jeremiah 25:22  ; Ezek. 26;  28:1-19  ;  Amos 1:9  Amos 1:10  ;  Zechariah 9:2-4  ).    Here a church was founded soon after the death of Stephen, and Paul, on his return from his third missionary journey spent a week in intercourse with the disciples there ( Acts 21:4  ). Here the scene at Miletus was repeated on his leaving them. They all, with their wives and children, accompanied him to the sea-shore. The sea-voyage of the apostle terminated at Ptolemais, about 38 miles from Tyre. Thence he proceeded to Caesarea ( Acts 21:5-8  ).    \"It is noticed on monuments as early as B.C. 1500, and claiming, according to Herodotus, to have been founded about B.C. 2700. It had two ports still existing, and was of commercial importance in all ages, with colonies at Carthage (about B.C. 850) and all over the Mediterranean. It was often attacked by Egypt and Assyria, and taken by Alexander the Great after a terrible siege in B.C. 332. It is now a town of 3,000 inhabitants, with ancient tombs and a ruined cathedral. A short Phoenician text of the fourth century B.C. is the only monument yet recovered.\"",

                "Light, or the moon city, a city \u201cof the Chaldees,\u201d the birthplace of Haran ([Gen. 11:28](/gen#Gen.11.28), [31](/gen#Gen.11.31)), the largest city of Shinar or northern Chaldea, and the principal commercial centre of the country as well as the centre of political power. It stood near the mouth of the Euphrates, on its western bank, and is represented by the mounds (of bricks cemented by bitumen) of el-Mugheir, i.e., \u201cthe bitumined,\u201d or \u201cthe town of bitumen,\u201d now 150 miles from the sea and some 6 miles from the Euphrates, a little above the point where it receives the Shat el-Hie, an affluent from the Tigris. It was formerly a maritime city, as the waters of the Persian Gulf reached thus far inland. Ur was the port of Babylonia, whence trade was carried on with the dwellers on the gulf, and with the distant countries of India, Ethiopia, and Egypt. It was abandoned about B.C. 500, but long continued, like Erech, to be a great sacred cemetery city, as is evident from the number of tombs found there.\n\n The oldest king of Ur known to us is Ur-Ba\u2019u (servant of the goddess Ba\u2019u), as Hommel reads the name, or Ur-Gur, as others read it. He lived some twenty-eight hundred years B.C., and took part in building the famous temple of the moon-god Sin in Ur itself. The illustration here given represents his cuneiform inscription, written in the Sumerian language, and stamped upon every brick of the temple in Ur. It reads: \u201cUr-Ba\u2019u, king of Ur, who built the temple of the moon-god.\u201d\n\n \u201cUr was consecrated to the worship of Sin, the Babylonian moon-god. It shared this honour, however, with another city, and this city was Haran, or Harran. Harran was in Mesopotamia, and took its name from the highroad which led through it from the east to the west. The name is Babylonian, and bears witness to its having been founded by a Babylonian king. The same witness is still more decisively borne by the worship paid in it to the Babylonian moon-god and by its ancient temple of Sin. Indeed, the temple of the moon-god at Harran was perhaps even more famous in the Assyrian and Babylonian world than the temple of the moon-god at Ur.\n\n \u201cBetween Ur and Harran there must, consequently, have been a close connection in early times, the record of which has not yet been recovered. It may be that Harran owed its foundation to a king of Ur; at any rate the two cities were bound together by the worship of the same deity, the closest and most enduring bond of union that existed in the ancient world. That Terah should have migrated from Ur to Harran, therefore, ceases to be extraordinary. If he left Ur at all, it was the most natural place to which to go. It was like passing from one court of a temple into another.\n\n \u201cSuch a remarkable coincidence between the Biblical narrative and the evidence of archaeological research cannot be the result of chance. The narrative must be historical; no writer of late date, even if he were a Babylonian, could have invented a story so exactly in accordance with what we now know to have been the truth. For a story of the kind to have been the invention of Palestinian tradition is equally impossible. To the unprejudiced mind there is no escape from the conclusion that the history of the migration of Terah from Ur to Harran is founded on fact\u201d (Sayce)."

Hosea also ([Hos. 2:15](/hos#Hos.2.15)) uses the expression in the same sense: \u201cThe valley of Achor for a door of hope;\u201d i.e., trouble would be turned into joy, despair into hope. This valley has been identified with the Wady Kelt."

It was one of the Levitical cities given to the Kohathites ([1 Chr. 6:69](/1chr#1Chr.6.69)). It was not far from Beth-shemesh ([2 Chr. 28:18](/2chr#2Chr.28.18)). It was the boundary between the kingdoms of Judah and Israel, and is frequently mentioned in Jewish history ([2 Chr. 11:10](/2chr#2Chr.11.10); [1 Sam. 14:31](/1sam#1Sam.14.31); [1 Chr. 8:13](/1chr#1Chr.8.13)). With reference to the valley named after the town, Joshua uttered the celebrated command, \u201cSun, stand thou still on Gibeon; and thou, Moon, in the valley of Ajalon\u201d ([Josh. 10:12](/josh#Josh.10.12)). It has been identified as the modern Yalo, at the foot of the Beth-horon pass (q.v.). In the Tell Amarna letters Adoni-zedek (q.v.) speaks of the destruction of the \u201ccity of Ajalon\u201d by the invaders, and describes himself as \u201cafflicted, greatly afflicted\u201d by the calamities that had come on the land, urging the king of Egypt to hasten to his help."

It had been the place where the idolatrous Jews burned their children alive to Moloch and Baal. A particular part of the valley was called Tophet, or the \u201cfire-stove,\u201d where the children were burned. After the Exile, in order to show their abhorrence of the locality, the Jews made this valley the receptacle of the offal of the city, for the destruction of which a fire was, as is supposed, kept constantly burning there.\n\n The Jews associated with this valley these two ideas, (1) that of the sufferings of the victims that had there been sacrificed; and (2) that of filth and corruption. It became thus to the popular mind a symbol of the abode of the wicked hereafter. It came to signify hell as the place of the wicked. \u201cIt might be shown by infinite examples that the Jews expressed hell, or the place of the damned, by this word. The word Gehenna [the Greek contraction of Hinnom] was never used in the time of Christ in any other sense than to denote the place of future punishment.\u201d About this fact there can be no question. In this sense the word is used eleven times in our Lord\u2019s discourses ([Matt. 23:33](/matt#Matt.23.33); [Luke 12:5](/luke#Luke.12.5); [Matt. 5:22](/matt#Matt.5.22), etc.)."

When David became king over all Israel, the Philistines, judging that he would now become their uncompromising enemy, made a sudden attack upon Hebron, compelling David to retire from it. He sought refuge in \u201cthe hold\u201d at Adullam ([2 Sam. 5:17-22](/2sam#2Sam.5.17)), and the Philistines took up their position in the valley of Rephaim, on the west and south-west of Jerusalem. Thus all communication between Bethlehem and Jerusalem was intercepted. While David and his army were encamped here, there occurred that incident narrated in [2 Sam. 23:15-17](/2sam#2Sam.23.15). Having obtained divine direction, David led his army against the Philistines, and gained a complete victory over them. The scene of this victory was afterwards called Baalperazim (q.v.).\n\n A second time, however, the Philistines rallied their forces in this valley ([2 Sam. 5:22](/2sam#2Sam.5.22)). Again warned by a divine oracle, David led his army to Gibeon, and attacked the Philistines from the south, inflicting on them another severe defeat, and chasing them with great slaughter to Gezer (q.v.). There David kept in check these enemies of Israel. This valley is now called el-Bukei\u2019a."

                "A town in the Negeb, or south country of Judah ([Josh. 15:31](/josh#Josh.15.31)), in the possession of the Philistines when David fled to Gath from Ziph with all his followers. Achish, the king, assigned him Ziklag as his place of residence. There he dwelt for over a year and four months. From this time it pertained to the kings of Judah ([1 Sam. 27:6](/1sam#1Sam.27.6)). During his absence with his army to join the Philistine expedition against the Israelites (29:11), it was destroyed by the Amalekites (30:1, 2), whom David, however, pursued and utterly routed, returning all the captives ([1 Sam. 30:26-31](/1sam#1Sam.30.26)). Two days after his return from this expedition, David received tidings of the disastrous battle of Gilboa and of the death of Saul ([2 Sam. 1:1-16](/2sam#2Sam.1.1)). He now left Ziklag and returned to Hebron, along with his two wives, Ahinoam and Abigail, and his band of 600 men. It has been identified with \u2018Asluj, a heap of ruins south of Beersheba. Conder, however, identifies it with Khirbet Zuheilikah, ruins found on three hills half a mile apart, some seventeen miles north-west of Beersheba, on the confines of Philistia, Judah, and Amalek."

                "(Old Egypt. Sant= \u201cstronghold,\u201d the modern San). A city on the Tanitic branch of the Nile, called by the Greeks Tanis. It was built seven years after Hebron in Palestine ([Num. 13:22](/num#Num.13.22)). This great and important city was the capital of the Hyksos, or Shepherd kings, who ruled Egypt for more than 500 years. It was the frontier town of Goshen. Here Pharaoh was holding his court at the time of his various interviews with Moses and Aaron. \u201cNo trace of Zoan exists; Tanis was built over it, and city after city has been built over the ruins of that\u201d (Harper, Bible and Modern Discovery). Extensive mounds of ruins, the wreck of the ancient city, now mark its site ([Isa. 19:11](/isa#Isa.19.11), [13](/isa#Isa.19.13); 30:4; [Ezek. 30:14](/ezek#Ezek.30.14)). \u201cThe whole constitutes one of the grandest and oldest ruins in the world.\u201d\n\n This city was also called \u201cthe Field of Zoan\u201d ([Ps. 78:12](/ps#Ps.78.12), [43](/ps#Ps.78.43)) and \u201cthe Town of Rameses\u201d (q.v.), because the oppressor rebuilt and embellished it, probably by the forced labour of the Hebrews, and made it his northern capital."
