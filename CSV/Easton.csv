Aaron,1,a-p1.11,Aaron,"The eldest son of Amram and Jochebed, a daughter of Levi ([Ex. 6:20](/exod#Exod.6.20)). Some explain the name as meaning mountaineer, others mountain of strength, illuminator. He was born in Egypt three years before his brother Moses, and a number of years after his sister Miriam (2:1, 4; 7:7). He married Elisheba, the daughter of Amminadab of the house of Judah (6:23; [1 Chr. 2:10](/1chr#1Chr.2.10)), by whom he had four sons, Nadab and Abihu, Eleazar and Ithamar. When the time for the deliverance of Isarael out of Egypt drew nigh, he was sent by God ([Ex. 4:14](/exod#Exod.4.14), [27-30](/exod#Exod.4.27)) to meet his long-absent brother, that he might co-operate with him in all that they were required to do in bringing about the Exodus. He was to be the “mouth” or “prophet” of Moses, i.e., was to speak for him, because he was a man of a ready utterance (7:1, 2, 9, 10, 19). He was faithful to his trust, and stood by Moses in all his interviews with Pharaoh.

 When the ransomed tribes fought their first battle with Amalek in Rephidim, Moses stood on a hill overlooking the scene of the conflict with the rod of God in his outstretched hand. On this occasion he was attended by Aaron and Hur, his sister’s husband, who held up his wearied hands till Joshua and the chosen warriors of Israel gained the victory (17:8-13).

 Afterwards, when encamped before Sinai, and when Moses at the command of God ascended the mount to receive the tables of the law, Aaron and his two sons, Nadab and Abihu, along with seventy of the elders of Israel, were permitted to accompany him part of the way, and to behold afar off the manifestation of the glory of Israel’s God ([Ex. 19:24](/exod#Exod.19.24); [24:9-11](/exod#Exod.24.9)). While Moses remained on the mountain with God, Aaron returned unto the people; and yielding through fear, or ignorance, or instability of character, to their clamour, made unto them a golden calf, and set it up as an object of worship ([Ex. 32:4](/exod#Exod.32.4); [Ps. 106:19](/ps#Ps.106.19)). On the return of Moses to the camp, Aaron was sternly rebuked by him for the part he had acted in this matter; but he interceded for him before God, who forgave his sin ([Deut. 9:20](/deut#Deut.9.20)).

 On the mount, Moses received instructions regarding the system of worship which was to be set up among the people; and in accordance therewith Aaron and his sons were consecrated to the priest’s office ([Lev. 8](/lev#Lev.8); [9](/lev#Lev.9)). Aaron, as high priest, held henceforth the prominent place appertaining to that office.

 When Israel had reached Hazeroth, in “the wilderness of Paran,” Aaron joined with his sister Miriam in murmuring against Moses, “because of the Ethiopian woman whom he had married,” probably after the death of Zipporah. But the Lord vindicated his servant Moses, and punished Miriam with leprosy ([Num. 12](/num#Num.12)). Aaron acknowledged his own and his sister’s guilt, and at the intercession of Moses they were forgiven.

 Twenty years after this, when the children of Israel were encamped in the wilderness of Paran, Korah, Dathan, and Abiram conspired against Aaron and his sons; but a fearful judgment from God fell upon them, and they were destroyed, and the next day thousands of the people also perished by a fierce pestilence, the ravages of which were only stayed by the interposition of Aaron ([Num. 16](/num#Num.16)). That there might be further evidence of the divine appointment of Aaron to the priestly office, the chiefs of the tribes were each required to bring to Moses a rod bearing on it the name of his tribe. And these, along with the rod of Aaron for the tribe of Levi, were laid up overnight in the tabernacle, and in the morning it was found that while the other rods remained unchanged, that of Aaron “for the house of Levi” budded, blossomed, and yielded almonds ([Num. 17:1-10](/num#Num.17.1)). This rod was afterwards preserved in the tabernacle ([Heb. 9:4](/heb#Heb.9.4)) as a memorial of the divine attestation of his appointment to the priesthood.

 Aaron was implicated in the sin of his brother at Meribah ([Num. 20:8-13](/num#Num.20.8)), and on that account was not permitted to enter the Promised Land. When the tribes arrived at Mount Hor, “in the edge of the land of Edom,” at the command of God Moses led Aaron and his son Eleazar to the top of that mountain, in the sight of all the people. There he stripped Aaron of his priestly vestments, and put them upon Eleazar; and there Aaron died on the top of the mount, being 123 years old ([Num. 20:23-29](/num#Num.20.23). Comp. [Deut. 10:6](/deut#Deut.10.6); [32:50](/deut#Deut.32.50)), and was “gathered unto his people.” The people, “even all the house of Israel,” mourned for him thirty days. Of Aaron’s sons two survived him, Eleazar, whose family held the high-priesthood till the time of Eli; and Ithamar, in whose family, beginning with Eli, the high-priesthood was held till the time of Solomon. Aaron’s other two sons had been struck dead ([Lev. 10:1](/lev#Lev.10.1), [2](/lev#Lev.10.2)) for the daring impiety of offering “strange fire” on the alter of incense.

 The Arabs still show with veneration the traditionary site of Aaron’s grave on one of the two summits of Mount Hor, which is marked by a Mohammedan chapel. His name is mentioned in the Koran, and there are found in the writings of the rabbins many fabulous stories regarding him.

 He was the first anointed priest. His descendants, “the house of Aaron,” constituted the priesthood in general. In the time of David they were very numerous ([1 Chr. 12:27](/1chr#1Chr.12.27)). The other branches of the tribe of Levi held subordinate positions in connection with the sacred office. Aaron was a type of Christ in his official character as the high priest. His priesthood was a “shadow of heavenly things,” and was intended to lead the people of Israel to look forward to the time when “another priest” would arise “after the order of Melchizedek” ([Heb. 6:20](/heb#Heb.6.20)).",0.0,person,aaron_1,aaron_1,

Abel,23,a-p27.2,Abel,"(Heb. Hebhel), a breath, or vanity, the second son of Adam and Eve. He was put to death by his brother Cain ([Gen. 4:1-16](/gen#Gen.4.1)). Guided by the instruction of their father, the two brothers were trained in the duty of worshipping God. “And in process of time” (marg. “at the end of days”, i.e., on the Sabbath) each of them offered up to God of the first-fruits of his labours. Cain, as a husbandman, offered the fruits of the field; Abel, as a shepherd, of the firstlings of his flock. “The Lord had respect unto Abel and his offering; but unto Cain and his offering he had not respect” ([Gen. 4:3-5](/gen#Gen.4.3)). On this account Cain was angry with his brother, and formed the design of putting him to death; a design which he at length found an opportunity of carrying into effect ([Gen. 4:8](/gen#Gen.4.8), [9](/gen#Gen.4.9). Comp. [1 John 3:12](/1john#1John.3.12)). There are several references to Abel in the New Testament. Our Saviour speaks of him as “righteous” ([Matt. 23:35](/matt#Matt.23.35)). “The blood of sprinkling” is said to speak “better things than that of Abel” ([Heb. 12:24](/heb#Heb.12.24)); i.e., the blood of Jesus is the reality of which the blood of the offering made by Abel was only the type. The comparison here is between the sacrifice offered by Christ and that offered by Abel, and not between the blood of Christ calling for mercy and the blood of the murdered Abel calling for vengeance, as has sometimes been supposed. It is also said ([Heb. 11:4](/heb#Heb.11.4)) that “Abel offered unto God a more excellent sacrifice than Cain.” This sacrifice was made “by faith;” this faith rested in God, not only as the Creator and the God of providence, but especially in God as the great Redeemer, whose sacrifice was typified by the sacrifices which, no doubt by the divine institution, were offered from the days of Adam downward. On account of that “faith” which looked forward to the great atoning sacrifice, Abel’s offering was accepted of God. Cain’s offering had no such reference, and therefore was rejected. Abel was the first martyr, as he was the first of our race to die.

 Abel (Heb. ‘abhel), lamentation ([1 Sam. 6:18](/1sam#1Sam.6.18)), the name given to the great stone in Joshua’s field whereon the ark was “set down.” The Revised Version, however, following the Targum and the LXX., reads in the Hebrew text ’ebhen (= a stone), and accordingly translates “unto the great stone, whereon they set down the ark.” This reading is to be preferred.

He remained with David, and became priest of the party of which he was the leader ([1 Sam. 30:7](/1sam#1Sam.30.7)). When David ascended the throne of Judah, Abiathar was appointed high priest ([1 Chr. 15:11](/1chr#1Chr.15.11); [1 Kings 2:26](/1kgs#1Kgs.2.26)) and the “king’s companion” ([1 Chr. 27:34](/1chr#1Chr.27.34)). Meanwhile Zadok, of the house of Eleazar, had been made high priest. These appointments continued in force till the end of David’s reign ([1 Kings 4:4](/1kgs#1Kgs.4.4)). Abiathar was deposed (the sole historical instance of the deposition of a high priest) and banished to his home at Anathoth by Solomon, because he took part in the attempt to raise Adonijah to the throne.

It is not implied in Mark that he was actual high priest at the time referred to.

A few years after this Abimelech visited Abraham, who had removed southward beyond his territory, and there entered into a league of peace and friendship with him.

Ablution 4,98,a-p85.3,Ablution,"A fourth class of ablutions is mentioned, by which a person purified or absolved himself from the guilt of some particular act.

So also Pilate declared himself innocent of the blood of Jesus by washing his hands ([Matt. 27:24](/matt#Matt.27.24)).

He first introduced David to the court of Saul after the victory over Goliath ([1 Sam. 17:57](/1sam#1Sam.17.57)). After the death of Saul, David was made king over Judah, and reigned in Hebron. Among the other tribes there was a feeling of hostility to Judah; and Abner, at the head of Ephraim, fostered this hostility in the interest of the house of Saul, whose son Ish-bosheth he caused to be proclaimed king ([2 Sam. 2:8](/2sam#2Sam.2.8)). A state of war existed between these two kings. A battle fatal to Abner, who was the leader of Ish-boseth’s army, was fought with David’s army under Joab at Gibeon ([2 Sam. 2:12](/2sam#2Sam.2.12)). Abner, escaping from the field, was overtaken by Asahel, who was “light of foot as a wild roe,” the brother of Joab and Abishai, whom he thrust through with a back stroke of his spear ([2 Sam. 2](/2sam#2Sam.2): 18-32).

 Being rebuked by Ish-bosheth for the impropriety of taking to wife Rizpah, who had been a concubine of King Saul, he found an excuse for going over to the side of David, whom he now professed to regard as anointed by the Lord to reign over all Israel. David received him favourably, and promised that he would have command of the armies. At this time Joab was absent from Hebron, but on his return he found what had happened. Abner had just left the city; but Joab by a stratagem recalled him, and meeting him at the gate of the city on his return, thrust him through with his sword ([2 Sam. 3:27](/2sam#2Sam.3.27), [31](/2sam#2Sam.3.31)-39; 4:12.

(Comp. [1 Macc. 1:57](/1macc#1Macc.1.57)). This was the abomination of the desolation of Jerusalem. The same language is employed in [Dan. 9:27](/dan#Dan.9.27) (comp. [Matt. 24:15](/matt#Matt.24.15)), where the reference is probably to the image-crowned standards which the Romans set up at the east gate of the temple (A.D. 70), and to which they paid idolatrous honours. “Almost the entire religion of the Roman camp consisted in worshipping the ensign, swearing by the ensign, and in preferring the ensign before all other gods.” These ensigns were an “abomination” to the Jews, the “abomination of desolation.”

Abraham,105,a-p97.4,Abraham,"Father of a multitude, son of Terah, named ([Gen. 11:27](/gen#Gen.11.27)) before his older brothers Nahor and Haran, because he was the heir of the promises. Till the age of seventy, Abram sojourned among his kindred in his native country of Chaldea. He then, with his father and his family and household, quitted the city of Ur, in which he had hitherto dwelt, and went some 300 miles north to Haran, where he abode fifteen years. The cause of his migration was a call from God ([Acts 7:2-4](/acts#Acts.7.2)). There is no mention of this first call in the Old Testament; it is implied, however, in [Gen. 12](/gen#Gen.12). While they tarried at Haran, Terah died at the age of 205 years. Abram now received a second and more definite call, accompanied by a promise from God ([Gen. 12:1](/gen#Gen.12.1), [2](/gen#Gen.12.2)); whereupon he took his departure, taking his nephew Lot with him, “not knowing whither he went” ([Heb. 11:8](/heb#Heb.11.8)). He trusted implicitly to the guidance of Him who had called him.

 Abram now, with a large household of probably a thousand souls, entered on a migratory life, and dwelt in tents. Passing along the valley of the Jabbok, in the land of Canaan, he formed his first encampment at Sichem ([Gen. 12:6](/gen#Gen.12.6)), in the vale or oak-grove of Moreh, between Ebal on the north and Gerizim on the south. Here he received the great promise, “I will make of thee a great nation,” etc. ([Gen. 12:2](/gen#Gen.12.2), [3](/gen#Gen.12.3), [7](/gen#Gen.12.7)). This promise comprehended not only temporal but also spiritual blessings. It implied that he was the chosen ancestor of the great Deliverer whose coming had been long ago predicted ([Gen. 3:15](/gen#Gen.3.15)). Soon after this, for some reason not mentioned, he removed his tent to the mountain district between Bethel, then called Luz, and Ai, towns about two miles apart, where he built an altar to “Jehovah.” He again moved into the southern tract of Palestine, called by the Hebrews the Negeb; and was at length, on account of a famine, compelled to go down into Egypt. This took place in the time of the Hyksos, a Semitic race which now held the Egyptians in bondage. Here occurred that case of deception on the part of Abram which exposed him to the rebuke of Pharaoh ([Gen. 12:18](/gen#Gen.12.18)). Sarai was restored to him; and Pharaoh loaded him with presents, recommending him to withdraw from the country. He returned to Canaan richer than when he left it, “in cattle, in silver, and in gold” ([Gen. 12:8](/gen#Gen.12.8); [13:2](/gen#Gen.13.2). Comp. [Ps. 105:13](/ps#Ps.105.13), [14](/ps#Ps.105.14)). The whole party then moved northward, and returned to their previous station near Bethel. Here disputes arose between Lot’s shepherds and those of Abram about water and pasturage. Abram generously gave Lot his choice of the pasture-ground. (Comp. [1 Cor. 6:7](/1cor#1Cor.6.7).) He chose the well-watered plain in which Sodom was situated, and removed thither; and thus the uncle and nephew were separated. Immediately after this Abram was cheered by a repetition of the promises already made to him, and then removed to the plain or “oak-grove” of Mamre, which is in Hebron. He finally settled here, pitching his tent under a famous oak or terebinth tree, called “the oak of Mamre” ([Gen. 13:18](/gen#Gen.13.18)). This was his third resting-place in the land.

 Some fourteen years before this, while Abram was still in Chaldea, Palestine had been invaded by Chedorlaomer, King of Elam, who brought under tribute to him the five cities in the plain to which Lot had removed. This tribute was felt by the inhabitants of these cities to be a heavy burden, and after twelve years they revolted. This brought upon them the vengeance of Chedorlaomer, who had in league with him four other kings. He ravaged the whole country, plundering the towns, and carrying the inhabitants away as slaves. Among those thus treated was Lot. Hearing of the disaster that had fallen on his nephew, Abram immediately gathered from his own household a band of 318 armed men, and being joined by the Amoritish chiefs Mamre, Aner, and Eshcol, he pursued after Chedorlaomer, and overtook him near the springs of the Jordan. They attacked and routed his army, and pursued it over the range of Anti-Libanus as far as to Hobah, near Damascus, and then returned, bringing back all the spoils that had been carried away. Returning by way of Salem, i.e., Jerusalem, the king of that place, Melchizedek, came forth to meet them with refreshments. To him Abram presented a tenth of the spoils, in recognition of his character as a priest of the most high God ([Gen. 14:18-20](/gen#Gen.14.18)).

 In a recently-discovered tablet, dated in the reign of the grandfather of Amraphel ([Gen. 14:1](/gen#Gen.14.1)), one of the witnesses is called “the Amorite, the son of Abiramu,” or Abram.

 Having returned to his home at Mamre, the promises already made to him by God were repeated and enlarged ([Gen. 13:14](/gen#Gen.13.14)). “The word of the Lord” (an expression occurring here for the first time) “came to him” (15:1). He now understood better the future that lay before the nation that was to spring from him. Sarai, now seventy-five years old, in her impatience, persuaded Abram to take Hagar, her Egyptian maid, as a concubine, intending that whatever child might be born should be reckoned as her own. Ishmael was accordingly thus brought up, and was regarded as the heir of these promises ([Gen. 16](/gen#Gen.16)). When Ishmael was thirteen years old, God again revealed yet more explicitly and fully his gracious purpose; and in token of the sure fulfilment of that purpose the patriarch’s name was now changed from Abram to Abraham ([Gen. 17:4](/gen#Gen.17.4), [5](/gen#Gen.17.5)), and the rite of circumcision was instituted as a sign of the covenant. It was then announced that the heir to these covenant promises would be the son of Sarai, though she was now ninety years old; and it was directed that his name should be Isaac. At the same time, in commemoration of the promises, Sarai’s name was changed to Sarah. On that memorable day of God’s thus revealing his design, Abraham and his son Ishmael and all the males of his house were circumcised ([Gen. 17](/gen#Gen.17)). Three months after this, as Abraham sat in his tent door, he saw three men approaching. They accepted his proffered hospitality, and, seated under an oak-tree, partook of the fare which Abraham and Sarah provided. One of the three visitants was none other than the Lord, and the other two were angels in the guise of men. The Lord renewed on this occasion his promise of a son by Sarah, who was rebuked for her unbelief. Abraham accompanied the three as they proceeded on their journey. The two angels went on toward Sodom; while the Lord tarried behind and talked with Abraham, making known to him the destruction that was about to fall on that guilty city. The patriarch interceded earnestly in behalf of the doomed city. But as not even ten righteous persons were found in it, for whose sake the city would have been spared, the threatened destruction fell upon it; and early next morning Abraham saw the smoke of the fire that consumed it as the “smoke of a furnace” ([Gen. 19:1-28](/gen#Gen.19.1)).

 After fifteen years’ residence at Mamre, Abraham moved southward, and pitched his tent among the Philistines, near to Gerar. Here occurred that sad instance of prevarication on his part in his relation to Abimelech the King ([Gen. 20](/gen#Gen.20)). Soon after this event, the patriarch left the vicinity of Gerar, and moved down the fertile valley about 25 miles to Beer-sheba. It was probably here that Isaac was born, Abraham being now an hundred years old. A feeling of jealousy now arose between Sarah and Hagar, whose son, Ishmael, was no longer to be regarded as Abraham’s heir. Sarah insisted that both Hagar and her son should be sent away. This was done, although it was a hard trial to Abraham ([Gen. 21:12](/gen#Gen.21.12)). (See  HAGAR; ISHMAEL.)

 At this point there is a blank in the patriarch’s history of perhaps twenty-five years. These years of peace and happiness were spent at Beer-sheba. The next time we see him his faith is put to a severe test by the command that suddenly came to him to go and offer up Isaac, the heir of all the promises, as a sacrifice on one of the mountains of Moriah. His faith stood the test ([Heb. 11:17-19](/heb#Heb.11.17)). He proceeded in a spirit of unhesitating obedience to carry out the command; and when about to slay his son, whom he had laid on the altar, his uplifted hand was arrested by the angel of Jehovah, and a ram, which was entangled in a thicket near at hand, was seized and offered in his stead. From this circumstance that place was called Jehovah-jireh, i.e., “The Lord will provide.” The promises made to Abraham were again confirmed (and this was the last recorded word of God to the patriarch); and he descended the mount with his son, and returned to his home at Beer-sheba ([Gen. 22:19](/gen#Gen.22.19)), where he resided for some years, and then moved northward to Hebron.

 Some years after this Sarah died at Hebron, being 127 years old. Abraham acquired now the needful possession of a burying-place, the cave of Machpelah, by purchase from the owner of it, Ephron the Hittite ([Gen. 23](/gen#Gen.23)); and there he buried Sarah. His next care was to provide a wife for Isaac, and for this purpose he sent his steward, Eliezer, to Haran (or Charran, [Acts 7:2](/acts#Acts.7.2)), where his brother Nahor and his family resided ([Gen. 11:31](/gen#Gen.11.31)). The result was that Rebekah, the daughter of Nahor’s son Bethuel, became the wife of Isaac ([Gen. 24](/gen#Gen.24)). Abraham then himself took to wife Keturah, who became the mother of six sons, whose descendants were afterwards known as the “children of the east” ([Judg. 6:3](/judg#Judg.6.3)), and later as “Saracens.” At length all his wanderings came to an end. At the age of 175 years, 100 years after he had first entered the land of Canaan, he died, and was buried in the old family burying-place at Machpelah ([Gen. 25:7-10](/gen#Gen.25.7)).

 The history of Abraham made a wide and deep impression on the ancient world, and references to it are interwoven in the religious traditions of almost all Eastern nations. He is called “the friend of God” ([James 2:23](/jas#Jas.2.23)), “faithful Abraham” ([Gal. 3:9](/gal#Gal.3.9)), “the father of us all” ([Rom. 4:16](/rom#Rom.4.16)).",0.0,person,abraham_58,abraham_58,

Absalom,109,a-p109.3,Absalom,"Father of peace; i.e., “peaceful” David’s son by Maacah ([2 Sam. 3:3](/2sam#2Sam.3.3); comp. [1 Kings 1:6](/1kgs#1Kgs.1.6)). He was noted for his personal beauty and for the extra-ordinary profusion of the hair of his head ([2 Sam. 14:25](/2sam#2Sam.14.25),[26](/2sam#2Sam.14.26)). The first public act of his life was the blood-revenge he executed against Amnon, David’s eldest son, who had basely wronged Absalom’s sister Tamar. This revenge was executed at the time of the festivities connected with a great sheep-shearing at Baal-hazor. David’s other sons fled from the place in horror, and brought the tidings of the death of Amnon to Jerusalem. Alarmed for the consequences of the act, Absalom fled to his grandfather at Geshur, and there abode for three years ([2 Sam. 3:3](/2sam#2Sam.3.3); [13:23-38](/2sam#2Sam.13.23)).

 David mourned his absent son, now branded with the guilt of fratricide. As the result of a stratagem carried out by a woman of Tekoah, Joab received David’s sanction to invite Absalom back to Jerusalem. He returned accordingly, but two years elapsed before his father admitted him into his presence ([2 Sam. 14:28](/2sam#2Sam.14.28)). Absalom was now probably the oldest surviving son of David, and as he was of royal descent by his mother as well as by his father, he began to aspire to the throne. His pretensions were favoured by the people. By many arts he gained their affection; and after his return from Geshur ([2 Sam. 15:7](/2sam#2Sam.15.7); marg., R.V.) he went up to Hebron, the old capital of Judah, along with a great body of the people, and there proclaimed himself king. The revolt was so successful that David found it necessary to quit Jerusalem and flee to Mahanaim, beyond Jordan; where upon Absalom returned to Jerusalem and took possession of the throne without opposition. Ahithophel, who had been David’s chief counsellor, deserted him and joined Absalom, whose chief counsellor he now became. Hushai also joined Absalom, but only for the purpose of trying to counteract the counsels of Ahithophel, and so to advantage David’s cause. He was so far successful that by his advice, which was preferred to that of Ahithophel, Absalom delayed to march an army against his father, who thus gained time to prepare for the defence.

 Absalom at length marched out against his father, whose army, under the command of Joab, he encountered on the borders of the forest of Ephraim. Twenty thousand of Absalom’s army were slain in that fatal battle, and the rest fled. Absalom fled on a swift mule; but his long flowing hair, or more probably his head, was caught in the bough of an oak, and there he was left suspended till Joab came up and pierced him through with three darts. His body was then taken down and cast into a pit dug in the forest, and a heap of stones was raised over his grave. When the tidings of the result of that battle were brought to David, as he sat impatiently at the gate of Mahanaim, and he was told that Absalom had been slain, he gave way to the bitter lamentation: “O my son Absalom, my son, my son Absalom! would God I had died for thee, O Absalom, my son, my son!” ([2 Sam. 18:33](/2sam#2Sam.18.33). Comp. [Ex. 32:32](/exod#Exod.32.32); [Rom. 9:3](/rom#Rom.9.3)).

It was one of the cities of Nimrod’s kingdom ([Ge 10:10](/gen#Gen.10.10)). It stood close to the Euphrates, opposite Sippara.

 It is also the name of the country of which this city was the capital, namely, northern or upper Babylonia. The Accadians who came from the “mountains of the east,” where the ark rested, attained to a high degree of civilization. In the Babylonian inscriptions they are called “the black heads” and “the black faces,” in contrast to “the white race” of Semitic descent. They invented the form of writing in pictorial hieroglyphics, and also the cuneiform system, in which they wrote many books partly on papyrus and partly on clay. The Semitic Babylonians (“the white race”), or, as some scholars think, first the Cushites, and afterwards, as a second immigration, the Semites, invaded and conquered this country; and then the Accadian language ceased to be a spoken language, although for the sake of its literary treasures it continued to be studied by the educated classes of Babylonia. A large portion of the Ninevite tablets brought to light by Oriental research consists of interlinear or parallel translations from Accadian into Assyrian; and thus that long-forgotten language has been recovered by scholars. It belongs to the class of languages called agglutinative, common to the Tauranian race; i.e., it consists of words “glued together,” without declension of conjugation. These tablets in a remarkable manner illustrate ancient history.

Acts of the Apostles,132,a-p132.3,Acts of the Apostles,"The title now given to the fifth and last of the historical books of the New Testament. The author styles it a “treatise” (1:1). It was early called “The Acts,” “The Gospel of the Holy Ghost,” and “The Gospel of the Resurrection.” It contains properly no account of any of the apostles except Peter and Paul. John is noticed only three times; and all that is recorded of James, the son of Zebedee, is his execution by Herod. It is properly therefore not the history of the “Acts of the Apostles,” a title which was given to the book at a later date, but of “Acts of Apostles,” or more correctly, of “Some Acts of Certain Apostles.”

 As regards its authorship, it was certainly the work of Luke, the “beloved physician” (comp. [Luke 1:1-4](/luke#Luke.1.1); [Acts 1:1](/acts#Acts.1.1)). This is the uniform tradition of antiquity, although the writer nowhere makes mention of himself by name. The style and idiom of the Gospel of Luke and of the Acts, and the usage of words and phrases common to both, strengthen this opinion. The writer first appears in the narrative in 16:11, and then disappears till Paul’s return to Philippi two years afterwards, when he and Paul left that place together (20:6), and the two seem henceforth to have been constant companions to the end. He was certainly with Paul at Rome (28; [Col. 4:14](/col#Col.4.14)). Thus he wrote a great portion of that history from personal observation. For what lay beyond his own experience he had the instruction of Paul. If, as is very probable, 2 Tim. was written during Paul’s second imprisonment at Rome, Luke was with him then as his faithful companion to the last ([2 Tim. 4:11](/2tim#2Tim.4.11)). Of his subsequent history we have no certain information.

 The design of Luke’s Gospel was to give an exhibition of the character and work of Christ as seen in his history till he was taken up from his disciples into heaven; and of the Acts, as its sequel, to give an illustration of the power and working of the gospel when preached among all nations, “beginning at Jerusalem.” The opening sentences of the Acts are just an expansion and an explanation of the closing words of the Gospel. In this book we have just a continuation of the history of the church after Christ’s ascension. Luke here carries on the history in the same spirit in which he had commenced it. It is only a book of beginnings, a history of the founding of churches, the initial steps in the formation of the Christian society in the different places visited by the apostles. It records a cycle of “representative events.”

 All through the narrative we see the ever-present, all-controlling power of the ever-living Saviour. He worketh all and in all in spreading abroad his truth among men by his Spirit and through the instrumentality of his apostles.

 The time of the writing of this history may be gathered from the fact that the narrative extends down to the close of the second year of Paul’s first imprisonment at Rome. It could not therefore have been written earlier than A.D. 61 or 62, nor later than about the end of A.D. 63. Paul was probably put to death during his second imprisonment, about A.D. 64, or, as some think, 66.

 The place where the book was written was probably Rome, to which Luke accompanied Paul.

 The key to the contents of the book is in 1:8, “Ye shall be witnesses unto me both in Jerusalem, and in all Judea, and in Samaria, and unto the uttermost part of the earth.” After referring to what had been recorded in a “former treatise” of the sayings and doings of Jesus Christ before his ascension, the author proceeds to give an account of the circumstances connected with that event, and then records the leading facts with reference to the spread and triumphs of Christianity over the world during a period of about thirty years. The record begins with Pentecost (A.D. 33) and ends with Paul’s first imprisonment (A.D. 63 or 64). The whole contents of the book may be divided into these three parts:",0.0,unmatched,unmatched,,

 In this book it is worthy of note that no mention is made of the writing by Paul of any of his epistles. This may be accounted for by the fact that the writer confined himself to a history of the planting of the church, and not to that of its training or edification. The relation, however, between this history and the epistles of Paul is of such a kind, i.e., brings to light so many undesigned coincidences, as to prove the genuineness and authenticity of both, as is so ably shown by Paley in his Horae Paulinae. “No ancient work affords so many tests of veracity; for no other has such numerous points of contact in all directions with contemporary history, politics, and topography, whether Jewish, or Greek, or Roman.” Lightfoot.",3.0,unmatched,unmatched,,

Adam,139,a-p145.3,Adam,"Red, a Babylonian word, the generic name for man, having the same meaning in the Hebrew and the Assyrian languages. It was the name given to the first man, whose creation, fall, and subsequent history and that of his descendants are detailed in the first book of Moses ([Gen. 1:27](/gen#Gen.1.27)-ch. 5). “God created man [Heb., Adam] in his own image, in the image of God created he him; male and female created he them.”

 Adam was absolutely the first man whom God created. He was formed out of the dust of the earth (and hence his name), and God breathed into his nostrils the breath of life, and gave him dominion over all the lower creatures ([Gen. 1:26](/gen#Gen.1.26); [2:7](/gen#Gen.2.7)). He was placed after his creation in the Garden of Eden, to cultivate it, and to enjoy its fruits under this one prohibition: “Of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil thou shalt not eat of it; for in the day that thou eatest thereof thou shalt surely die.”

 The first recorded act of Adam was his giving names to the beasts of the field and the fowls of the air, which God brought to him for this end. Thereafter the Lord caused a deep sleep to fall upon him, and while in an unconscious state took one of his ribs, and closed up his flesh again; and of this rib he made a woman, whom he presented to him when he awoke. Adam received her as his wife, and said, “This is now bone of my bones, and flesh of my flesh: she shall be called Woman, because she was taken out of Man.” He called her Eve, because she was the mother of all living.

 Being induced by the tempter in the form of a serpent to eat the forbidden fruit, Eve persuaded Adam, and he also did eat. Thus man fell, and brought upon himself and his posterity all the sad consequences of his transgression. The narrative of the Fall comprehends in it the great promise of a Deliverer ([Gen. 3:15](/gen#Gen.3.15)), the “first gospel” message to man. They were expelled from Eden, and at the east of the garden God placed a flame, which turned every way, to prevent access to the tree of life ([Gen. 3](/gen#Gen.3)). How long they were in Paradise is matter of mere conjecture.

 Shortly after their expulsion Eve brought forth her first-born, and called him Cain. Although we have the names of only three of Adam’s sons, viz., Cain, Abel, and Seth, yet it is obvious that he had several sons and daughters ([Gen. 5:4](/gen#Gen.5.4)). He died aged 930 years.

 Adam and Eve were the progenitors of the whole human race. Evidences of varied kinds are abundant in proving the unity of the human race. The investigations of science, altogether independent of historical evidence, lead to the conclusion that God “hath made of one blood all nations of men for to dwell on all the face of the earth” ([Acts 17:26](/acts#Acts.17.26).

Adultery,190,a-p190.4,Adultery,"Conjugal infidelity. An adulterer was a man who had illicit intercourse with a married or a betrothed woman, and such a woman was an adulteress. Intercourse between a married man and an unmarried woman was fornication. Adultery was regarded as a great social wrong, as well as a great sin.

 The Mosaic law ([Num. 5:11-31](/num#Num.5.11)) prescribed that the suspected wife should be tried by the ordeal of the “water of jealousy.” There is, however, no recorded instance of the application of this law. In subsequent times the Rabbis made various regulations with the view of discovering the guilty party, and of bringing about a divorce. It has been inferred from [John 8:1-11](/john#John.8.1) that this sin became very common during the age preceding the destruction of Jerusalem.

 Idolatry, covetousness, and apostasy are spoken of as adultery spiritually ([Jer. 3:6](/jer#Jer.3.6), [8](/jer#Jer.3.8), [9](/jer#Jer.3.9); [Ezek. 16:32](/ezek#Ezek.16.32); [Hos. 1:2](/hos#Hos.1.2):3; [Rev. 2:22](/rev#Rev.2.22)).

The Egyptians excelled in agriculture. And after the Israelites entered into the possession of the Promised Land, their circumstances favoured in the highest degree a remarkable development of this art. Agriculture became indeed the basis of the Mosaic commonwealth.

 The year in Palestine was divided into six agricultural periods:-

 I. SOWING TIME.  Tisri, latter half  (beginning about the autumnal equinox.)  Marchesvan.  Kisleu, former half.  Early rain due = first showers of autumn.

 II. UNRIPE TIME.  Kisleu, latter half.  Tebet.  Sebat, former half.

 III. COLD SEASON.  Sebat, latter half.  Adar.  [Veadar.]  Nisan, former half.  Latter rain due ([Deut. 11:14](/deut#Deut.11.14); [Jer. 5:24](/jer#Jer.5.24); [Hos. 6:3](/hos#Hos.6.3); [Zech. 10:1](/zech#Zech.10.1);  [James 5:7](/jas#Jas.5.7); [Job 29:23](/job#Job.29.23)).

 IV. HARVEST TIME.  Nisan, latter half.  (Beginning about vernal equinox. Barley green. Passover.)  Ijar.  Sivan, former half., Wheat ripe. Pentecost.

 V. SUMMER (total absence of rain)  Sivan, latter half.  Tammuz.  Ab, former half.

 VI. SULTRY SEASON  Ab, latter half.  Elul.  Tisri, former half., Ingathering of fruits.

 The six months from the middle of Tisri to the middle of Nisan were occupied with the work of cultivation, and the rest of the year mainly with the gathering in of the fruits. The extensive and easily-arranged system of irrigation from the rills and streams from the mountains made the soil in every part of Palestine richly productive ([Ps. 1:3](/ps#Ps.1.3); [65:10](/ps#Ps.65.10); [Prov. 21:1](/prov#Prov.21.1); [Isa. 30:25](/isa#Isa.30.25); [32:2](/isa#Isa.32.2), [20](/isa#Isa.32.20); [Hos. 12:11](/hos#Hos.12.11)), and the appliances of careful cultivation and of manure increased its fertility to such an extent that in the days of Solomon, when there was an abundant population, “20,000 measures of wheat year by year” were sent to Hiram in exchange for timber ([1 Kings 5:11](/1kgs#1Kgs.5.11)), and in large quantities also wheat was sent to the Tyrians for the merchandise in which they traded ([Ezek. 27:17](/ezek#Ezek.27.17)). The wheat sometimes produced an hundredfold ([Gen. 26:12](/gen#Gen.26.12); [Matt. 13:23](/matt#Matt.13.23)). Figs and pomegranates were very plentiful ([Num. 13:23](/num#Num.13.23)), and the vine and the olive grew luxuriantly and produced abundant fruit ([Deut. 33:24](/deut#Deut.33.24)).

 Lest the productiveness of the soil should be exhausted, it was enjoined that the whole land should rest every seventh year, when all agricultural labour would entirely cease ([Lev. 25:1-7](/lev#Lev.25.1); [Deut. 15:1-10](/deut#Deut.15.1)).

 It was forbidden to sow a field with divers seeds ([Deut. 22:9](/deut#Deut.22.9)). A passer-by was at liberty to eat any quantity of corn or grapes, but he was not permitted to carry away any ([Deut. 23:24](/deut#Deut.23.24), [25](/deut#Deut.23.25); [Matt. 12:1](/matt#Matt.12.1)). The poor were permitted to claim the corners of the fields and the gleanings. A forgotten sheaf in the field was to be left also for the poor. (See [Lev. 19:9](/lev#Lev.19.9), [10](/lev#Lev.19.10); [Deut. 24:19](/deut#Deut.24.19).)

 Agricultural implements and operations.

 The sculptured monuments and painted tombs of Egypt and Assyria throw much light on this subject, and on the general operations of agriculture. Ploughs of a simple construction were known in the time of Moses ([Deut. 22:10](/deut#Deut.22.10); comp. [Job 1:14](/job#Job.1.14)). They were very light, and required great attention to keep them in the ground ([Luke 9:62](/luke#Luke.9.62)). They were drawn by oxen ([Job 1:14](/job#Job.1.14)), cows ([1 Sam. 6:7](/1sam#1Sam.6.7)), and asses ([Isa. 30:24](/isa#Isa.30.24)); but an ox and an ass must not be yoked together in the same plough ([Deut. 22:10](/deut#Deut.22.10)). Men sometimes followed the plough with a hoe to break the clods ([Isa. 28:24](/isa#Isa.28.24)). The oxen were urged on by a “goad,” or long staff pointed at the end, so that if occasion arose it could be used as a spear also ([Judg. 3:31](/judg#Judg.3.31); [1 Sam. 13:21](/1sam#1Sam.13.21)).

 When the soil was prepared, the seed was sown broadcast over the field ([Matt. 13:3-8](/matt#Matt.13.3)). The “harrow” mentioned in [Job 39:10](/job#Job.39.10) was not used to cover the seeds, but to break the clods, being little more than a thick block of wood. In highly irrigated spots the seed was trampled in by cattle ([Isa. 32:20](/isa#Isa.32.20)); but doubtless there was some kind of harrow also for covering in the seed scattered in the furrows of the field.

 The reaping of the corn was performed either by pulling it up by the roots, or cutting it with a species of sickle, according to circumstances. The corn when cut was generally put up in sheaves ([Gen. 37:7](/gen#Gen.37.7); [Lev. 23:10-15](/lev#Lev.23.10); [Ruth 2:7](/ruth#Ruth.2.7), [15](/ruth#Ruth.2.15); [Job 24:10](/job#Job.24.10); [Jer. 9:22](/jer#Jer.9.22); [Micah 4:12](/mic#Mic.4.12)), which were afterwards gathered to the threshing-floor or stored in barns ([Matt. 6:26](/matt#Matt.6.26)).

 The process of threshing was performed generally by spreading the sheaves on the threshing-floor and causing oxen and cattle to tread repeatedly over them ([Deut. 25:4](/deut#Deut.25.4); [Isa. 28:28](/isa#Isa.28.28)). On occasions flails or sticks were used for this purpose ([Ruth 2:17](/ruth#Ruth.2.17); [Isa. 28:27](/isa#Isa.28.27)). There was also a “threshing instrument” ([Isa. 41:15](/isa#Isa.41.15); [Amos 1:3](/amos#Amos.1.3)) which was drawn over the corn. It was called by the Hebrews a moreg, a threshing roller or sledge ([2 Sam. 24:22](/2sam#2Sam.24.22); [1 Chr. 21:23](/1chr#1Chr.21.23); [Isa. 3:15](/isa#Isa.3.15)). It was somewhat like the Roman tribulum, or threshing instrument.

 When the grain was threshed, it was winnowed by being thrown up against the wind ([Jer. 4:11](/jer#Jer.4.11)), and afterwards tossed with wooden scoops ([Isa. 30:24](/isa#Isa.30.24)).

His wife was Jezebel (q.v.), who exercised a very evil influence over him. To the calf-worship introduced by Jeroboam he added the worship of Baal. He was severely admonished by Elijah (q.v.) for his wickedness. His anger was on this account kindled against the prophet, and he sought to kill him. He undertook three campaigns against Ben-hadad II., king of Damascus. In the first two, which were defensive, he gained a complete victory over Ben-hadad, who fell into his hands, and was afterwards released on the condition of his restoring all the cities of Israel he then held, and granting certain other concessions to Ahab. After three years of peace, for some cause Ahab renewed war ([1 Kings 22:3](/1kgs#1Kgs.22.3)) with Ben-hadad by assaulting the city of Ramoth-gilead, although the prophet Micaiah warned him that he would not succeed, and that the 400 false prophets who encouraged him were only leading him to his ruin. Micaiah was imprisoned for thus venturing to dissuade Ahab from his purpose. Ahab went into the battle disguised, that he might if possible escape the notice of his enemies; but an arrow from a bow “drawn at a venture” pierced him, and though stayed up in his chariot for a time he died towards evening, and Elijah’s prophecy ([1 Kings 21:19](/1kgs#1Kgs.21.19)) was fulfilled.

Alabaster,285,a-p290.4,Alabaster,"Occurs only in the New Testament in connection with the box of “ointment of spikenard very precious,” with the contents of which a woman anointed the head of Jesus as he sat at supper in the house of Simon the leper ([Matt. 26:7](/matt#Matt.26.7); [Mark 14:3](/mark#Mark.14.3); [Luke 7:37](/luke#Luke.7.37)). These boxes were made from a stone found near Alabastron in Egypt, and from this circumstance the Greeks gave them the name of the city where they were made. The name was then given to the stone of which they were made; and finally to all perfume vessels, of whatever material they were formed. The woman “broke” the vessel; i.e., she broke off, as was usually done, the long and narrow neck so as to reach the contents. This stone resembles marble, but is softer in its texture, and hence very easily wrought into boxes. Mark says (14:5) that this box of ointment was worth more than 300 pence, i.e., denarii, each of the value of sevenpence halfpenny of our money, and therefore worth about 10 pounds. But if we take the denarius as the day’s wage of a labourer ([Matt. 20:2](/matt#Matt.20.2)), say two shillings of our money, then the whole would be worth about 30 pounds, so costly was Mary’s offering.",0.0,unmatched,unmatched,,

Joshua and the elders of Israel entered into an alliance with the Gibeonites ([Josh. 9:3-27](/josh#Josh.9.3)). When the Israelites entered Palestine they were forbidden to enter into alliances with the inhabitants of the country ([Lev. 18:3](/lev#Lev.18.3), [4](/lev#Lev.18.4); 20:22, 23).

 Solomon formed a league with Hiram ([1 Kings 5:12](/1kgs#1Kgs.5.12)). This “brotherly covenant” is referred to 250 years afterwards ([Amos 1:9](/amos#Amos.1.9)). He also appears to have entered into an alliance with Pharaoh ([1 Kings 10:28](/1kgs#1Kgs.10.28), [29](/1kgs#1Kgs.10.29)).

 In the subsequent history of the kingdoms of Judah and Israel various alliances were formed between them and also with neighbouring nations at different times.

 From patriarchal times a covenant of alliance was sealed by the blood of some sacrificial victim. The animal sacrificed was cut in two (except birds), and between these two parts the persons contracting the alliance passed ([Gen. 15:10](/gen#Gen.15.10)). There are frequent allusions to this practice ([Jer. 34:18](/jer#Jer.34.18)). Such alliances were called “covenants of salt” ([Num. 18:19](/num#Num.18.19); [2 Chr. 13:5](/2chr#2Chr.13.5)), salt being the symbol of perpetuity. A pillar was set up as a memorial of the alliance between Laban and Jacob ([Gen. 31:52](/gen#Gen.31.52)). The Jews throughout their whole history attached great importance to fidelity to their engagements.

Almond,312,a-p321.3,Almond,"A native of Syria and Palestine. In form, blossoms, and fruit it resembles the peach tree. Its blossoms are of a very pale pink colour, and appear before its leaves. Its Hebrew name, shaked, signifying “wakeful, hastening,” is given to it on account of its putting forth its blossoms so early, generally in February, and sometimes even in January. In [Eccl. 12:5](/eccl#Eccl.12.5), it is referred to as illustrative, probably, of the haste with which old age comes. There are others, however, who still contend for the old interpretation here. “The almond tree bears its blossoms in the midst of winter, on a naked, leafless stem, and these blossoms (reddish or flesh-coloured in the beginning) seem at the time of their fall exactly like white snow-flakes. In this way the almond blossom is a very fitting symbol of old age, with its silvery hair and its wintry, dry, barren, unfruitful condition.” In [Jer. 1:11](/jer#Jer.1.11) “I see a rod of an almond tree [shaked]...for I will hasten [shaked] my word to perform it” the word is used as an emblem of promptitude. Jacob desired his sons ([Gen. 43:11](/gen#Gen.43.11)) to take with them into Egypt of the best fruits of the land, almonds, etc., as a present to Joseph, probably because this tree was not a native of Egypt. Aaron’s rod yielded almonds ([Num. 17:8](/num#Num.17.8); [Heb. 9:4](/heb#Heb.9.4)). Moses was directed to make certain parts of the candlestick for the ark of carved work “like unto almonds” ([Ex. 25:33](/exod#Exod.25.33), [34](/exod#Exod.25.34)). The Hebrew word luz, translated “hazel” in the Authorized Version ([Gen. 30:37](/gen#Gen.30.37)), is rendered in the Revised Version “almond.” It is probable that luz denotes the wild almond, while shaked denotes the cultivated variety.",0.0,unmatched,unmatched,,

They cared not only for the poor among themselves, but contributed also to the necessities of those at a distance ([Acts 11:29](/acts#Acts.11.29); [24:17](/acts#Acts.24.17); [2 Cor. 9:12](/2cor#2Cor.9.12)). Our Lord and his attendants showed an example also in this ([John 13:29](/john#John.13.29)).

Some suppose it to have been the white sandal-wood of India, the Santalum album of botanists, a native of the mountainous parts of the Malabar coasts. It is a fragrant wood, and is used in China for incense in idol-worship.

There is another and more common species, called by Indians aghil, whence Europeans have given it the name of Lignum aquile, or eagle-wood. Aloewood was used by the Egyptians for embalming dead bodies. Nicodemus brought it (pounded aloe-wood) to embalm the body of Christ ([John 19:39](/john#John.19.39)); but whether this was the same as that mentioned elsewhere is uncertain.

The word is used in [Heb. 13:10](/heb#Heb.13.10) for the sacrifice offered upon it—the sacrifice Christ offered.

 Paul found among the many altars erected in Athens one bearing the inscription, “To the unknown God” ([Acts 17:23](/acts#Acts.17.23)), or rather “to an [i.e., some] unknown God.” The reason for this inscription cannot now be accurately determined. It afforded the apostle the occasion of proclaiming the gospel to the “men of Athens.”

 The first altar we read of is that erected by Noah ([Gen. 8:20](/gen#Gen.8.20)). Altars were erected by Abraham ([Gen. 12:7](/gen#Gen.12.7); [13:4](/gen#Gen.13.4); [22:9](/gen#Gen.22.9)), by Isaac ([Gen. 26:25](/gen#Gen.26.25)), by Jacob (33:20; 35:1, 3), and by Moses ([Ex. 17:15](/exod#Exod.17.15), “Jehovah-nissi”).

 In the tabernacle, and afterwards in the temple, two altars were erected.",0.0,unmatched,unmatched,,
Altar 1,320,a-p330.2,Altar,"The altar of burnt offering ([Ex. 30:28](/exod#Exod.30.28)), called also the “brasen altar” ([Ex. 39:39](/exod#Exod.39.39)) and “the table of the Lord” ([Mal. 1:7](/mal#Mal.1.7)).

 This altar, as erected in the tabernacle, is described in [Ex. 27:1-8](/exod#Exod.27.1). It was a hollow square, 5 cubits in length and in breadth, and 3 cubits in height. It was made of shittim wood, and was overlaid with plates of brass. Its corners were ornamented with “horns” ([Ex. 29:12](/exod#Exod.29.12); [Lev. 4:18](/lev#Lev.4.18)).

 In [Ex. 27:3](/exod#Exod.27.3) the various utensils appertaining to the altar are enumerated. They were made of brass. (Comp. [1 Sam. 2:13](/1sam#1Sam.2.13), [14](/1sam#1Sam.2.14); [Lev. 16:12](/lev#Lev.16.12); [Num. 16:6](/num#Num.16.6), [7](/num#Num.16.7).)

 In Solomon’s temple the altar was of larger dimensions ([2 Chr. 4:1](/2chr#2Chr.4.1). Comp. [1 Kings 8:22](/1kgs#1Kgs.8.22), [64](/1kgs#1Kgs.8.64); 9:25), and was made wholly of brass, covering a structure of stone or earth. This altar was renewed by Asa ([2 Chr. 15:8](/2chr#2Chr.15.8)). It was removed by Ahaz ([2 Kings 16:14](/2kgs#2Kgs.16.14)), and “cleansed” by Hezekiah, in the latter part of whose reign it was rebuilt. It was finally broken up and carried away by the Babylonians ([Jer. 52:17](/jer#Jer.52.17)).

 After the return from captivity it was re-erected ([Ezra 3:3](/ezra#Ezra.3.3), [6](/ezra#Ezra.3.6)) on the same place where it had formerly stood. (Comp. [1 Macc. 4:47](/1macc#1Macc.4.47).) When Antiochus Epiphanes pillaged Jerusalem the altar of burnt offering was taken away.

 Again the altar was erected by Herod, and remained in its place till the destruction of Jerusalem by the Romans (70 A.D.).

 The fire on the altar was not permitted to go out ([Lev. 6:9](/lev#Lev.6.9)).

 In the Mosque of Omar, immediately underneath the great dome, which occupies the site of the old temple, there is a rough projection of the natural rock, of about 60 feet in its extreme length, and 50 in its greatest breadth, and in its highest part about 4 feet above the general pavement. This rock seems to have been left intact when Solomon’s temple was built. It was in all probability the site of the altar of burnt offering. Underneath this rock is a cave, which may probably have been the granary of Araunah’s threshing-floor ([1 Chr. 21:22](/1chr#1Chr.21.22)).",1.0,unmatched,unmatched,,
Altar 2,321,a-p330.2,Altar,"The altar of incense ([Ex. 30:1-10](/exod#Exod.30.1)), called also “the golden altar” (39:38; [Num. 4:11](/num#Num.4.11)), stood in the holy place “before the vail that is by the ark of the testimony.” On this altar sweet spices were continually burned with fire taken from the brazen altar. The morning and the evening services were commenced by the high priest offering incense on this altar. The burning of the incense was a type of prayer ([Ps. 141:2](/ps#Ps.141.2); [Rev. 5:8](/rev#Rev.5.8); [8:3](/rev#Rev.8.3), [4](/rev#Rev.8.4)).

 This altar was a small movable table, made of acacia wood overlaid with gold ([Ex. 37:25](/exod#Exod.37.25), [26](/exod#Exod.37.26)). It was 1 cubit in length and breadth, and 2 cubits in height.

 In Solomon’s temple the altar was similar in size, but was made of cedar-wood ([1 Kings 6:20](/1kgs#1Kgs.6.20); [7:48](/1kgs#1Kgs.7.48)) overlaid with gold. In [Ezek. 41:22](/ezek#Ezek.41.22) it is called “the altar of wood.” (Comp. [Ex. 30:1-6](/exod#Exod.30.1).)

 In the temple built after the Exile the altar was restored. Antiochus Epiphanes took it away, but it was afterwards restored by Judas Maccabaeus ([1 Macc. 1:23](/1macc#1Macc.1.23); [4:49](/1macc#1Macc.4.49)). Among the trophies carried away by Titus on the destruction of Jerusalem the altar of incense is not found, nor is any mention made of it in [Heb. 9](/heb#Heb.9). It was at this altar Zacharias ministered when an angel appeared to him ([Luke 1:11](/luke#Luke.1.11)).

They were a pastoral, and hence a nomadic race. Their kings bore the hereditary name of Agag ([Num. 24:7](/num#Num.24.7); [1 Sam. 15:8](/1sam#1Sam.15.8)). They attempted to stop the Israelites when they marched through their territory ([Deut. 25:18](/deut#Deut.25.18)), attacking them at Rephidim ([Ex. 17:8-13](/exod#Exod.17.8); comp.

Ammonite,381,a-p396.3,Ammonite,"The usual name of the descendants of Ammon, the son of Lot ([Gen. 19:38](/gen#Gen.19.38)). From the very beginning ([Deut. 2:16-20](/deut#Deut.2.16)) of their history till they are lost sight of ([Judg. 5:2](/judg#Judg.5.2)), this tribe is closely associated with the Moabites ([Judg. 10:11](/judg#Judg.10.11); [2 Chr. 20:1](/2chr#2Chr.20.1); [Zeph. 2:8](/zeph#Zeph.2.8)). Both of these tribes hired Balaam to curse Israel ([Deut. 23:4](/deut#Deut.23.4)). The Ammonites were probably more of a predatory tribe, moving from place to place, while the Moabites were more settled. They inhabited the country east of the Jordan and north of Moab and the Dead Sea, from which they had expelled the Zamzummims or Zuzims ([Deut. 2:20](/deut#Deut.2.20); [Gen. 14:5](/gen#Gen.14.5)). They are known as the Beni-ammi ([Gen. 19:38](/gen#Gen.19.38)), Ammi or Ammon being worshipped as their chief god. They were of Semitic origin, and closely related to the Hebrews in blood and language. They showed no kindness to the Israelites when passing through their territory, and therefore they were prohibited from “entering the congregation of the Lord to the tenth generation” ([Deut. 23:3](/deut#Deut.23.3)). They afterwards became hostile to Israel ([Judg. 3:13](/judg#Judg.3.13)). Jephthah waged war against them, and “took twenty cities with a very great slaughter” ([Judg. 11:33](/judg#Judg.11.33)). They were again signally defeated by Saul ([1 Sam. 11:11](/1sam#1Sam.11.11)). David also defeated them and their allies the Syrians ([2 Sam. 10:6-14](/2sam#2Sam.10.6)), and took their chief city, Rabbah, with much spoil ([2 Sam. 10:14](/2sam#2Sam.10.14); [12:26-31](/2sam#2Sam.12.26)). The subsequent events of their history are noted in [2 Chr. 20:25](/2chr#2Chr.20.25); [26:8](/2chr#2Chr.26.8); [Jer. 49:1](/jer#Jer.49.1); [Ezek. 25:3](/ezek#Ezek.25.3), [6](/ezek#Ezek.25.6). One of Solomon’s wives was Naamah, an Ammonite. She was the mother of Rehoboam ([1 Kings 14:31](/1kgs#1Kgs.14.31); [2 Chr. 12:13](/2chr#2Chr.12.13)).

 The prophets predicted fearful judgments against the Ammonites because of their hostility to Israel ([Zeph. 2:8](/zeph#Zeph.2.8); [Jer. 49:1-6](/jer#Jer.49.1); [Ezek. 25:1-5](/ezek#Ezek.25.1), [10](/ezek#Ezek.25.10); [Amos 1:13-15](/amos#Amos.1.13)).

On the early Babylonian monuments all Syria, including Palestine, is known as “the land of the Amorites.” The southern slopes of the mountains of Judea are called the “mount of the Amorites” ([Deut. 1:7](/deut#Deut.1.7), [19](/deut#Deut.1.19), [20](/deut#Deut.1.20)).

The discrepancy supposed to exist between [Deut. 1:44](/deut#Deut.1.44) and [Num. 14:45](/num#Num.14.45) is explained by the circumstance that the terms “Amorites” and “Amalekites” are used synonymously for the “Canaanites.” In the same way we explain the fact that the “Hivites” of [Gen. 34:2](/gen#Gen.34.2) are the “Amorites” of 48:22.

They are supposed to have been men of great stature; their king, Og, is described by Moses as the last “of the remnant of the giants” ([Deut. 3:11](/deut#Deut.3.11)).

Under Jeroboam II. the kingdom of Israel rose to the zenith of its prosperity; but that was followed by the prevalence of luxury and vice and idolatry.

Ananias 1,413,a-p427.2,Ananias,"One of the members of the church at Jerusalem, who conspired with his wife Sapphira to deceive the brethren, and who fell down and immediately expired after he had uttered the falsehood ([Acts 5:5](/acts#Acts.5.5)). By common agreement the members of the early Christian community devoted their property to the work of furthering the gospel and of assisting the poor and needy. The proceeds of the possessions they sold were placed at the disposal of the apostles ([Acts 4:36](/acts#Acts.4.36), [37](/acts#Acts.4.37)). Ananias might have kept his property had he so chosen; but he professed agreement with the brethren in the common purpose, and had of his own accord devoted it all, as he said, to these sacred ends. Yet he retained a part of it for his own ends, and thus lied in declaring that he had given it all. “The offence of Ananias and Sapphira showed contempt of God, vanity and ambition in the offenders, and utter disregard of the corruption which they were bringing into the society.

He was so enraged at Paul’s noble declaration, “I have lived in all good conscience before God until this day,” that he commanded one of his attendants to smite him on the mouth. Smarting under this unprovoked insult, Paul quickly replied, “God shall smite thee, thou whited wall.” Being reminded that Ananias was the high priest, to whose office all respect was to be paid, he answered, “I wist not, brethren, that he was the high priest” ([Acts 23:5](/acts#Acts.23.5)). This expression has occasioned some difficulty, as it is scarcely probable that Paul should have been ignorant of so public a fact. The expression may mean (a) that Paul had at the moment overlooked the honour due to the high priest; or (b), as others think, that Paul spoke ironically, as if he had said, “The high priest breaking the law! God’s high priest a tyrant and a lawbreaker! I see a man in white robes, and have heard his voice, but surely it cannot, it ought not to be, the voice of the high priest.” (See Dr. Lindsay on Acts, in loco.) (c) Others think that from defect of sight Paul could not observe that the speaker was the high priest.

Anathema,417,a-p431.2,Anathema,"Anything laid up or suspended; hence anything laid up in a temple or set apart as sacred. In this sense the form of the word is anath(ee)ma, once in plural used in the Greek New Testament, in [Luke 21:5](/luke#Luke.21.5), where it is rendered “gifts.” In the LXX. the form anathema is generally used as the rendering of the Hebrew word herem, derived from a verb which means (1) to consecrate or devote; and (2) to exterminate. Any object so devoted to the Lord could not be redeemed ([Num. 18:14](/num#Num.18.14); [Lev. 27:28](/lev#Lev.27.28), [29](/lev#Lev.27.29)); and hence the idea of exterminating connected with the word. The Hebrew verb (haram) is frequently used of the extermination of idolatrous nations. It had a wide range of application. The anathema_ or _herem was a person or thing irrevocably devoted to God ([Lev. 27:21](/lev#Lev.27.21), [28](/lev#Lev.27.28)); and “none devoted shall be ransomed. He shall surely be put to death” (27:29). The word therefore carried the idea of devoted to destruction ([Num. 21:2](/num#Num.21.2), [3](/num#Num.21.3); [Josh. 6:17](/josh#Josh.6.17)); and hence generally it meant a thing accursed. In [Deut. 7:26](/deut#Deut.7.26) an idol is called a herem = anathema, a thing accursed.

 In the New Testament this word always implies execration. In some cases an individual denounces an anathema on himself unless certain conditions are fulfilled ([Acts 23:12](/acts#Acts.23.12), [14](/acts#Acts.23.14), [21](/acts#Acts.23.21)). “To call Jesus accursed” [anathema] ([1 Cor. 12:3](/1cor#1Cor.12.3)) is to pronounce him execrated or accursed. If any one preached another gospel, the apostle says, “let him be accursed” ([Gal. 1:8](/gal#Gal.1.8), [9](/gal#Gal.1.9)); i.e., let his conduct in so doing be accounted accursed.

 In [Rom. 9:3](/rom#Rom.9.3), the expression “accursed” (anathema) from Christ, i.e., excluded from fellowship or alliance with Christ, has occasioned much difficulty. The apostle here does not speak of his wish as a possible thing. It is simply a vehement expression of feeling, showing how strong was his desire for the salvation of his people.

 The anathema in [1 Cor. 16:22](/1cor#1Cor.16.22) denotes simply that they who love not the Lord are rightly objects of loathing and execration to all holy beings; they are guilty of a crime that merits the severest condemnation; they are exposed to the just sentence of “everlasting destruction from the presence of the Lord.”",0.0,unmatched,unmatched,,
Anathoth,418,a-p435.2,Anathoth,"The name of one of the cities of refuge, in the tribe of Benjamin ([Josh. 21:18](/josh#Josh.21.18)).

It was the native place of Abiezer, one of David’s “thirty” ([2 Sam. 23:27](/2sam#2Sam.23.27)), and of Jehu, another of his mighty men ([1 Chr. 12:3](/1chr#1Chr.12.3)).

In [Heb. 6:19](/heb#Heb.6.19) the word is used metaphorically for that which supports or keeps one steadfast in the time of trial or of doubt. It is an emblem of hope.

Andrew,421,a-p439.1,Andrew,"Manliness, a Greek name; one of the apostles of our Lord.

On one occasion John the Baptist, whose disciple he then was, pointing to Jesus, said, “Behold the Lamb of God” ([John 1:40](/john#John.1.40)); and Andrew, hearing him, immediately became a follower of Jesus, the first of his disciples. After he had been led to recognize Jesus as the Messiah, his first care was to bring also his brother Simon to Jesus. The two brothers seem to have after this pursued for a while their usual calling as fishermen, and did not become the stated attendants of the Lord till after John’s imprisonment ([Matt. 4:18](/matt#Matt.4.18), [19](/matt#Matt.4.19); [Mark 1:16](/mark#Mark.1.16), [17](/mark#Mark.1.17)). Very little is related of Andrew. He was one of the confidential disciples ([John 6:8](/john#John.6.8); [12:22](/john#John.12.22)), and with Peter, James, and John inquired of our Lord privately regarding his future coming ([Mark 13:3](/mark#Mark.13.3)). He was present at the feeding of the five thousand ([John 6:9](/john#John.6.9)), and he introduced the Greeks who desired to see Jesus ([John 12:22](/john#John.12.22)); but of his subsequent history little is known.

Angel,427,a-p444.2,Angel,"A word signifying, both in the Hebrew and Greek, a “messenger,” and hence employed to denote any agent God sends forth to execute his purposes.

 It is also applied to such impersonal agents as the pestilence ([2 Sam. 24:16](/2sam#2Sam.24.16), [17](/2sam#2Sam.24.17); [2 Kings 19:35](/2kgs#2Kgs.19.35)), the wind ([Ps. 104:4](/ps#Ps.104.4)).

 But its distinctive application is to certain heavenly intelligences whom God employs in carrying on his government of the world.

As finite creatures they may fall under temptation; and accordingly we read of “fallen angels.” Of the cause and manner of their “fall” we are wholly ignorant.

(b) They are specially God’s agents in carrying on his great work of redemption. There is no notice of angelic appearances to man till after the call of Abraham. From that time onward there are frequent references to their ministry on earth ([Gen. 18](/gen#Gen.18); [19](/gen#Gen.19); [24:7](/gen#Gen.24.7), [40](/gen#Gen.24.40); [28:12](/gen#Gen.28.12); [32:1](/gen#Gen.32.1)).

 The Incarnation introduces a new era in the ministrations of angels. They come with their Lord to earth to do him service while here. They predict his advent ([Matt. 1:20](/matt#Matt.1.20); [Luke 1:26-38](/luke#Luke.1.26)), minister to him after his temptation and agony ([Matt. 4:11](/matt#Matt.4.11); [Luke 22:43](/luke#Luke.22.43)), and declare his resurrection and ascension ([Matt. 28:2-8](/matt#Matt.28.2); [John 20:12](/john#John.20.12), [13](/john#John.20.13); [Acts 1:10](/acts#Acts.1.10), [11](/acts#Acts.1.11)).

They rejoice over a penitent sinner ([Luke 15:10](/luke#Luke.15.10)). They bear the souls of the redeemed to paradise ([Luke 16:22](/luke#Luke.16.22)); and they will be the ministers of judgement hereafter on the great day ([Matt. 13:39](/matt#Matt.13.39), [41](/matt#Matt.13.41), [49](/matt#Matt.13.49); [16:27](/matt#Matt.16.27); [24:31](/matt#Matt.24.31)). The passages ([Ps. 34:7](/ps#Ps.34.7), [Matt. 18:10](/matt#Matt.18.10)) usually referred to in support of the idea that every individual has a particular guardian angel have no such meaning. They merely indicate that God employs the ministry of angels to deliver his people from affliction and danger, and that the angels do not think it below their dignity to minister even to children and to the least among Christ’s disciples.

Our Lord was first brought before Annas, and after a brief questioning of him ([John 18:19-23](/john#John.18.19)) was sent to Caiaphas, when some members of the Sanhedrim had met, and the first trial of Jesus took place ([Matt. 26:57-68](/matt#Matt.26.57)). This examination of our Lord before Annas is recorded only by John.

It was called the “first city of the East.” Christianity was early introduced into it ([Acts 11:19](/acts#Acts.11.19), [21](/acts#Acts.11.21), [24](/acts#Acts.11.24)), and the name “Christian” was first applied here to its professors ([Acts 11:26](/acts#Acts.11.26)).

There is nothing to show that it was the “tree of the knowledge of good and evil.” Dr. Tristram has suggested that the apricot has better claims than any other fruit-tree to be the apple of Scripture. It grows to a height of 30 feet, has a roundish mass of glossy leaves, and bears an orange coloured fruit that gives out a delicious perfume.

This country is, however, divided by modern geographers into (1) Arabia Proper, or the Arabian Peninsula; (2) Northern Arabia, or the Arabian Desert; and (3) Western Arabia, which includes the peninsula of Sinai and the Desert of Petra, originally inhabited by the Horites ([Gen. 14:6](/gen#Gen.14.6), etc.), but in later times by the descendants of Esau, and known as the Land of Edom or Idumea, also as the Desert of Seir or Mount Seir.

 The whole land appears ([Gen. 10](/gen#Gen.10)) to have been inhabited by a variety of tribes of different lineage, Ishmaelites, Arabians, Idumeans, Horites, and Edomites; but at length becoming amalgamated, they came to be known by the general designation of Arabs. The modern nation of Arabs is predominantly Ishmaelite. Their language is the most developed and the richest of all the Semitic languages, and is of great value to the student of Hebrew.

 The Israelites wandered for forty years in Arabia. In the days of Solomon, and subsequently, commercial intercourse was to a considerable extent kept up with this country ([1 Kings 10:15](/1kgs#1Kgs.10.15); [2 Chr. 9:14](/2chr#2Chr.9.14); [17:11](/2chr#2Chr.17.11)).

Ark,533,a-p552.1,Ark,"Noah’s ark, a building of gopher-wood, and covered with pitch, 300 cubits long, 50 cubits broad, and 30 cubits high ([Gen. 6:14-16](/gen#Gen.6.14)); an oblong floating house of three stories, with a door in the side and a window in the roof. It was 100 years in building ([Gen. 5:32](/gen#Gen.5.32); [7:6](/gen#Gen.7.6)). It was intended to preserve certain persons and animals from the deluge which God was about to bring over the earth. It contained eight persons ([Gen. 7:13](/gen#Gen.7.13); 2 Pet. 2:5), and of all “clean” animals seven pairs, and of “unclean” one pair, and of birds seven pairs of each sort ([Gen. 7:2](/gen#Gen.7.2), [3](/gen#Gen.7.3)). It was in the form of an oblong square, with flat bottom and sloping roof. Traditions of the Deluge, by which the race of man was swept from the earth, and of the ark of Noah have been found existing among all nations.

 The ark of bulrushes in which the infant Moses was laid ([Ex. 2:3](/exod#Exod.2.3)) is called in the Hebrew teebah, a word derived from the Egyptian teb, meaning “a chest.” It was daubed with slime and with pitch. The bulrushes of which it was made were the papyrus reed.

 The sacred ark is designated by a different Hebrew word, ’aron’, which is the common name for a chest or coffer used for any purpose ([Gen. 50:26](/gen#Gen.50.26); [2 Kings 12:9](/2kgs#2Kgs.12.9), [10](/2kgs#2Kgs.12.10)). It is distinguished from all others by such titles as the “ark of God” ([1 Sam. 3:3](/1sam#1Sam.3.3)), “ark of the covenant” ([Josh. 3:6](/josh#Josh.3.6); [Heb. 9:4](/heb#Heb.9.4)), “ark of the testimony” ([Ex. 25:22](/exod#Exod.25.22)). It was made of acacia or shittim wood, a cubit and a half broad and high and two cubits long, and covered all over with the purest gold. Its upper surface or lid, the mercy-seat, was surrounded with a rim of gold; and on each of the two sides were two gold rings, in which were placed two gold-covered poles by which the ark could be carried ([Num. 7:9](/num#Num.7.9); [10:21](/num#Num.10.21); [4:5](/num#Num.4.5), [19](/num#Num.4.19), [20](/num#Num.4.20); [1 Kings 8:3](/1kgs#1Kgs.8.3), [6](/1kgs#1Kgs.8.6)). Over the ark, at the two extremities, were two cherubim, with their faces turned toward each other ([Lev. 16:2](/lev#Lev.16.2); [Num. 7:89](/num#Num.7.89)). Their outspread wings over the top of the ark formed the throne of God, while the ark itself was his footstool ([Ex. 25:10-22](/exod#Exod.25.10); [37:1-9](/exod#Exod.37.1)). The ark was deposited in the “holy of holies,” and was so placed that one end of the poles by which it was carried touched the veil which separated the two apartments of the tabernacle ([1 Kings 8:8](/1kgs#1Kgs.8.8)). The two tables of stone which constituted the “testimony” or evidence of God’s covenant with the people ([Deut. 31:26](/deut#Deut.31.26)), the “pot of manna” ([Ex. 16:33](/exod#Exod.16.33)), and “Aaron’s rod that budded” ([Num. 17:10](/num#Num.17.10)), were laid up in the ark ([Heb. 9:4](/heb#Heb.9.4)). (See  TABERNACLE)  The ark and the sanctuary were “the beauty of Israel” ([Lam. 2:1](/lam#Lam.2.1)). During the journeys of the Israelites the ark was carried by the priests in advance of the host ([Num. 4:5](/num#Num.4.5), [6](/num#Num.4.6); 10:33-36; [Ps. 68:1](/ps#Ps.68.1); [132:8](/ps#Ps.132.8)). It was borne by the priests into the bed of the Jordan, which separated, opening a pathway for the whole of the host to pass over ([Josh. 3:15](/josh#Josh.3.15), [16](/josh#Josh.3.16); 4:7, 10, 11, 17, 18). It was borne in the procession round Jericho ([Josh. 6:4](/josh#Josh.6.4), [6](/josh#Josh.6.6), [8](/josh#Josh.6.8), [11](/josh#Josh.6.11), [12](/josh#Josh.6.12)). When carried it was always wrapped in the veil, the badgers’ skins, and blue cloth, and carefully concealed even from the eyes of the Levites who carried it. After the settlement of Israel in Palestine the ark remained in the tabernacle at Gilgal for a season, and was then removed to Shiloh till the time of Eli, between 300 and 400 years ([Jer. 7:12](/jer#Jer.7.12)), when it was carried into the field of battle so as to secure, as they supposed, victory to the Hebrews, and was taken by the Philistines ([1 Sam. 4:3-11](/1sam#1Sam.4.3)), who sent it back after retaining it seven months ([1 Sam. 5:7](/1sam#1Sam.5.7), [8](/1sam#1Sam.5.8)). It remained then at Kirjath-jearim (7:1, 2) till the time of David (twenty years), who wished to remove it to Jerusalem; but the proper mode of removing it having been neglected, Uzzah was smitten with death for putting “forth his hand to the ark of God,” and in consequence of this it was left in the house of Obed-edom in Gath-rimmon for three months ([2 Sam. 6:1-11](/2sam#2Sam.6.1)), at the end of which time David removed it in a grand procession to Jerusalem, where it was kept till a place was prepared for it (12-19). It was afterwards deposited by Solomon in the temple ([1 Kings 8:6-9](/1kgs#1Kgs.8.6)). When the Babylonians destroyed Jerusalem and plundered the temple, the ark was probably taken away by Nebuchadnezzar and destroyed, as no trace of it is afterwards to be found. The absence of the ark from the second temple was one of the points in which it was inferior to the first temple.",0.0,unmatched,unmatched,,

Armour 1,540,a-p560.3,Armour,"The offensive weapons were different at different periods of history. The “rod of iron” ([Ps. 2:9](/ps#Ps.2.9)) is supposed to mean a mace or crowbar, an instrument of great power when used by a strong arm. The “maul” ([Prov. 25:18](/prov#Prov.25.18); cognate Hebrew word rendered “battle-axe” in [Jer. 51:20](/jer#Jer.51.20), and “slaughter weapon” in [Ezek. 9:2](/ezek#Ezek.9.2)) was a war-hammer or martel. The “sword” is the usual translation of hereb, which properly means “poniard.” The real sword, as well as the dirk-sword (which was always double-edged), was also used ([1 Sam. 17:39](/1sam#1Sam.17.39); [2 Sam. 20:8](/2sam#2Sam.20.8); [1 Kings 20:11](/1kgs#1Kgs.20.11)). The spear was another offensive weapon ([Josh. 8:18](/josh#Josh.8.18); [1 Sam. 17:7](/1sam#1Sam.17.7)). The javelin was used by light troops ([Num. 25:7](/num#Num.25.7), [8](/num#Num.25.8); [1 Sam. 13:22](/1sam#1Sam.13.22)). Saul threw a javelin at David ([1 Sam. 19:9](/1sam#1Sam.19.9), [10](/1sam#1Sam.19.10)), and so virtually absolved him from his allegiance. The bow was, however, the chief weapon of offence. The arrows were carried in a quiver, the bow being always unbent till the moment of action ([Gen. 27:3](/gen#Gen.27.3); [48:22](/gen#Gen.48.22); [Ps. 18:34](/ps#Ps.18.34)).

Armour 2,541,a-p560.3,Armour,"Of the defensive armour a chief place is assigned to the shield or buckler.

In [Ps. 91:4](/ps#Ps.91.4) “buckler” is properly a roundel appropriated to archers or slingers.

The cuirass and corselet, composed of leather or quilted cloth, were also for the covering of the body.

Each tribe formed a battalion, with its own banner and leader ([Num. 2:2](/num#Num.2.2); [10:14](/num#Num.10.14)). In war the army was divided into thousands and hundreds under their several captains ([Num. 31:14](/num#Num.31.14)), and also into families ([Num. 2:34](/num#Num.2.34); [2 Chr. 25:5](/2chr#2Chr.25.5); [26:12](/2chr#2Chr.26.12)). From the time of their entering the land of Canaan to the time of the kings, the Israelites made little progress in military affairs, although often engaged in warfare. The kings introduced the custom of maintaining a bodyguard (the Gibborim; i.e., “heroes”), and thus the nucleus of a standing army was formed. Saul had an army of 3,000 select warriors ([1 Sam. 13:2](/1sam#1Sam.13.2); [14:52](/1sam#1Sam.14.52); [24:2](/1sam#1Sam.24.2)). David also had a band of soldiers around him ([1 Sam. 23:13](/1sam#1Sam.23.13); [25:13](/1sam#1Sam.25.13)). To this band he afterwards added the Cherethites and the Pelethites ([2 Sam. 15:18](/2sam#2Sam.15.18); [20:7](/2sam#2Sam.20.7)). At first the army consisted only of infantry ([1 Sam. 4:10](/1sam#1Sam.4.10); [15:4](/1sam#1Sam.15.4)), as the use of horses was prohibited ([Deut. 17:16](/deut#Deut.17.16)); but chariots and horses were afterwards added ([2 Sam. 8:4](/2sam#2Sam.8.4); [1 Kings 10:26](/1kgs#1Kgs.10.26), [28](/1kgs#1Kgs.10.28), [29](/1kgs#1Kgs.10.29); [1 Kings 9:19](/1kgs#1Kgs.9.19)). In [1 Kings 9:22](/1kgs#1Kgs.9.22) there is given a list of the various gradations of rank held by those who composed the army. The equipment and maintenance of the army were at the public expense ([2 Sam. 17:28](/2sam#2Sam.17.28), [29](/2sam#2Sam.17.29); [1 Kings 4:27](/1kgs#1Kgs.4.27); [10:16](/1kgs#1Kgs.10.16), [17](/1kgs#1Kgs.10.17); [Judg. 20:10](/judg#Judg.20.10)).

Assurance,589,a-p609.3,Assurance,"The resurrection of Jesus ([Acts 17:31](/acts#Acts.17.31)) is the “assurance” (Gr. pistis, generally rendered “faith”) or pledge God has given that his revelation is true and worthy of acceptance. The “full assurance [Gr. plerophoria, ‘full bearing’] of faith” ([Heb. 10:22](/heb#Heb.10.22)) is a fulness of faith in God which leaves no room for doubt. The “full assurance of understanding” ([Col. 2:2](/col#Col.2.2)) is an entire unwavering conviction of the truth of the declarations of Scripture, a joyful steadfastness on the part of any one of conviction that he has grasped the very truth. The “full assurance of hope” ([Heb. 6:11](/heb#Heb.6.11)) is a sure and well-grounded expectation of eternal glory ([2 Tim. 4:7](/2tim#2Tim.4.7), [8](/2tim#2Tim.4.8)). This assurance of hope is the assurance of a man’s own particular salvation.

 This infallible assurance, which believers may attain unto as to their own personal salvation, is founded on the truth of the promises ([Heb. 6:18](/heb#Heb.6.18)), on the inward evidence of Christian graces, and on the testimony of the Spirit of adoption ([Rom. 8:16](/rom#Rom.8.16)). That such a certainty may be attained appears from the testimony of Scripture ([Rom. 8:16](/rom#Rom.8.16); [1 John 2:3](/1john#1John.2.3); [3:14](/1john#1John.3.14)), from the command to seek after it ([Heb. 6:11](/heb#Heb.6.11); 2 Pet. 1:10), and from the fact that it has been attained ([2 Tim. 1:12](/2tim#2Tim.1.12); [4:7](/2tim#2Tim.4.7), [8](/2tim#2Tim.4.8); [1 John 2:3](/1john#1John.2.3); [4:16](/1john#1John.4.16)).

 This full assurance is not of the essence of saving faith. It is the result of faith, and posterior to it in the order of nature, and so frequently also in the order of time. True believers may be destitute of it. Trust itself is something different from the evidence that we do trust. Believers, moreover, are exhorted to go on to something beyond what they at present have when they are exhorted to seek the grace of full assurance ([Heb. 10:22](/heb#Heb.10.22); 2 Pet. 1:5-10). The attainment of this grace is a duty, and is to be diligently sought.

 “Genuine assurance naturally leads to a legitimate and abiding peace and joy, and to love and thankfulness to God; and these from the very laws of our being to greater buoyancy, strength, and cheerfulness in the practice of obedience in every department of duty.”

 This assurance may in various ways be shaken, diminished, and intermitted, but the principle out of which it springs can never be lost.",0.0,unmatched,unmatched,,
Assyria,590,a-p614.2,Assyria,"The name derived from the city Asshur on the Tigris, the original capital of the country, was originally a colony from Babylonia, and was ruled by viceroys from that kingdom. It was a mountainous region lying to the north of Babylonia, extending along the Tigris as far as to the high mountain range of Armenia, the Gordiaean or Carduchian mountains. It was founded in B.C. 1700 under Bel-kap-kapu, and became an independent and a conquering power, and shook off the yoke of its Babylonian masters. It subdued the whole of Northern Asia. The Assyrians were Semites ([Gen. 10:22](/gen#Gen.10.22)), but in process of time non-Semite tribes mingled with the inhabitants. They were a military people, the “Romans of the East.”

 Of the early history of the kingdom of Assyria little is positively known. In B.C. 1120 Tiglath-pileser I., the greatest of the Assyrian kings, “crossed the Euphrates, defeated the kings of the Hittites, captured the city of Carchemish, and advanced as far as the shores of the Mediterranean.” He may be regarded as the founder of the first Assyrian empire. After this the Assyrians gradually extended their power, subjugating the states of Northern Syria. In the reign of Ahab, king of Israel, Shalmaneser II. marched an army against the Syrian states, whose allied army he encountered and vanquished at Karkar. This led to Ahab’s casting off the yoke of Damascus and allying himself with Judah. Some years after this the Assyrian king marched an army against Hazael, king of Damascus. He besieged and took that city. He also brought under tribute Jehu, and the cities of Tyre and Sidon.

 About a hundred years after this (B.C. 745) the crown was seized by a military adventurer called Pul, who assumed the name of Tiglath-pileser III. He directed his armies into Syria, which had by this time regained its independence, and took (B.C. 740) Arpad, near Aleppo, after a siege of three years, and reduced Hamath. Azariah (Uzziah) was an ally of the king of Hamath, and thus was compelled by Tiglath-pileser to do him homage and pay a yearly tribute.

 In B.C. 738, in the reign of Menahem, king of Israel, Pul invaded Israel, and imposed on it a heavy tribute ([2 Kings 15:19](/2kgs#2Kgs.15.19)). Ahaz, the king of Judah, when engaged in a war against Israel and Syria, appealed for help to this Assyrian king by means of a present of gold and silver ([2 Kings 16:8](/2kgs#2Kgs.16.8)); who accordingly “marched against Damascus, defeated and put Rezin to death, and besieged the city itself.” Leaving a portion of his army to continue the siege, “he advanced through the province east of Jordan, spreading fire and sword,” and became master of Philistia, and took Samaria and Damascus. He died B.C. 727, and was succeeded by Shalmanezer IV., who ruled till B.C. 722. He also invaded Syria ([2 Kings 17:5](/2kgs#2Kgs.17.5)), but was deposed in favour of Sargon (q.v.) the Tartan, or commander-in-chief of the army, who took Samaria (q.v.) after a siege of three years, and so put an end to the kingdom of Israel, carrying the people away into captivity, B.C. 722 ([2 Kings 17:1-6](/2kgs#2Kgs.17.1), [24](/2kgs#2Kgs.17.24); [18:7](/2kgs#2Kgs.18.7), [9](/2kgs#2Kgs.18.9)). He also overran the land of Judah, and took the city of Jerusalem ([Isa. 10:6](/isa#Isa.10.6), [12](/isa#Isa.10.12), [22](/isa#Isa.10.22), [24](/isa#Isa.10.24), [34](/isa#Isa.10.34)). Mention is next made of Sennacherib (B.C. 705), the son and successor of Sargon ([2 Kings 18:13](/2kgs#2Kgs.18.13); [19:37](/2kgs#2Kgs.19.37); [Isa. 7:17](/isa#Isa.7.17), [18](/isa#Isa.7.18)); and then of Esar-haddon, his son and successor, who took Manasseh, king of Judah, captive, and kept him for some time a prisoner at Babylon, which he alone of all the Assyrian kings made the seat of his government ([2 Kings 19:37](/2kgs#2Kgs.19.37); [Isa. 37:38](/isa#Isa.37.38)).

 Assur-bani-pal, the son of Esarhaddon, became king, and in [Ezra 4:10](/ezra#Ezra.4.10) is referred to as Asnapper. From an early period Assyria had entered on a conquering career, and having absorbed Babylon, the kingdoms of Hamath, Damascus, and Samaria, it conquered Phoenicia, and made Judea feudatory, and subjected Philistia and Idumea. At length, however, its power declined. In B.C. 727 the Babylonians threw off the rule of the Assyrians, under the leadership of the powerful Chaldean prince Merodach-baladan ([2 Kings 20:12](/2kgs#2Kgs.20.12)), who, after twelve years, was subdued by Sargon, who now reunited the kingdom, and ruled over a vast empire. But on his death the smouldering flames of rebellion again burst forth, and the Babylonians and Medes successfully asserted their independence (B.C. 625), and Assyria fell according to the prophecies of Isaiah (10:5-19), Nahum (3:19), and Zephaniah (3:13), and the many separate kingdoms of which it was composed ceased to recognize the “great king” ([2 Kings 18:19](/2kgs#2Kgs.18.19); [Isa. 36:4](/isa#Isa.36.4)). Ezekiel (31) attests (about B.C. 586) how completely Assyria was overthrown. It ceases to be a nation.",0.0,place,assyria_111,,assyria_111

In the Book of Job, which is the oldest book of the Bible in all probability, the constellations are distinguished and named. Mention is made of the “morning star” ([Rev. 2:28](/rev#Rev.2.28); comp. [Isa. 14:12](/isa#Isa.14.12)), the “seven stars” and “Pleiades,” “Orion,” “Arcturus,” the “Great Bear” ([Amos 5:8](/amos#Amos.5.8); [Job 9:9](/job#Job.9.9); [38:31](/job#Job.38.31)), “the crooked serpent,” Draco ([Job 26:13](/job#Job.26.13)), the Dioscuri, or Gemini, “Castor and Pollux” ([Acts 28:11](/acts#Acts.28.11)). The stars were called “the host of heaven” ([Isa. 40:26](/isa#Isa.40.26); [Jer. 33:22](/jer#Jer.33.22)).

 The oldest divisions of time were mainly based on the observation of the movements of the heavenly bodies, the “ordinances of heaven” ([Gen. 1:14-18](/gen#Gen.1.14); [Job 38:33](/job#Job.38.33); [Jer. 31:35](/jer#Jer.31.35); [33:25](/jer#Jer.33.25)). Such observations led to the division of the year into months and the mapping out of the appearances of the stars into twelve portions, which received from the Greeks the name of the “zodiac.” The word “Mazzaroth” ([Job 38:32](/job#Job.38.32)) means, as the margin notes, “the twelve signs” of the zodiac. Astronomical observations were also necessary among the Jews in order to the fixing of the proper time for sacred ceremonies, the “new moons,” the “passover,” etc. Many allusions are found to the display of God’s wisdom and power as seen in the starry heavens ([Ps. 8](/ps#Ps.8); [19:1-6](/ps#Ps.19.1); [Isa. 51:6](/isa#Isa.51.6), etc.)",0.0,unmatched,unmatched,,

Atonement,608,a-p632.3,Atonement,"This word does not occur in the Authorized Version of the New Testament except in [Rom. 5:11](/rom#Rom.5.11), where in the Revised Version the word “reconciliation” is used. In the Old Testament it is of frequent occurrence.

 The meaning of the word is simply at-one-ment, i.e., the state of being at one or being reconciled, so that atonement is reconciliation. Thus it is used to denote the effect which flows from the death of Christ.

 But the word is also used to denote that by which this reconciliation is brought about, viz., the death of Christ itself; and when so used it means satisfaction, and in this sense to make an atonement for one is to make satisfaction for his offences ([Ex. 32:30](/exod#Exod.32.30); [Lev. 4:26](/lev#Lev.4.26); [5:16](/lev#Lev.5.16); [Num. 6:11](/num#Num.6.11)), and, as regards the person, to reconcile, to propitiate God in his behalf.

 By the atonement of Christ we generally mean his work by which he expiated our sins. But in Scripture usage the word denotes the reconciliation itself, and not the means by which it is effected. When speaking of Christ’s saving work, the word “satisfaction,” the word used by the theologians of the Reformation, is to be preferred to the word “atonement.” Christ’s satisfaction is all he did in the room and in behalf of sinners to satisfy the demands of the law and justice of God. Christ’s work consisted of suffering and obedience, and these were vicarious, i.e., were not merely for our benefit, but were in our stead, as the suffering and obedience of our vicar, or substitute. Our guilt is expiated by the punishment which our vicar bore, and thus God is rendered propitious, i.e., it is now consistent with his justice to manifest his love to transgressors. Expiation has been made for sin, i.e., it is covered. The means by which it is covered is vicarious satisfaction, and the result of its being covered is atonement or reconciliation. To make atonement is to do that by virtue of which alienation ceases and reconciliation is brought about. Christ’s mediatorial work and sufferings are the ground or efficient cause of reconciliation with God. They rectify the disturbed relations between God and man, taking away the obstacles interposed by sin to their fellowship and concord. The reconciliation is mutual, i.e., it is not only that of sinners toward God, but also and pre-eminently that of God toward sinners, effected by the sin-offering he himself provided, so that consistently with the other attributes of his character his love might flow forth in all its fulness of blessing to men. The primary idea presented to us in different forms throughout the Scripture is that the death of Christ is a satisfaction of infinite worth rendered to the law and justice of God (q.v.), and accepted by him in room of the very penalty man had incurred. It must also be constantly kept in mind that the atonement is not the cause but the consequence of God’s love to guilty men ([John 3:16](/john#John.3.16); [Rom. 3:24](/rom#Rom.3.24), [25](/rom#Rom.3.25); [Eph. 1:7](/eph#Eph.1.7); [1 John 1:9](/1john#1John.1.9); [4:9](/1john#1John.4.9)). The atonement may also be regarded as necessary, not in an absolute but in a relative sense, i.e., if man is to be saved, there is no other way than this which God has devised and carried out ([Ex. 34:7](/exod#Exod.34.7); [Josh. 24:19](/josh#Josh.24.19); [Ps. 5:4](/ps#Ps.5.4); [7:11](/ps#Ps.7.11); [Nahum 1:2](/nah#Nah.1.2), [6](/nah#Nah.1.6); [Rom. 3:5](/rom#Rom.3.5)).

This word has given rise to many different views. Some Jewish interpreters regard it as the name of a place some 12 miles east of Jerusalem, in the wilderness. Others take it to be the name of an evil spirit, or even of Satan. But when we remember that the two goats together form a type of Christ, on whom the Lord “laid the iniquity of us all,” and examine into the root meaning of this word (viz., “separation”), the interpretation of those who regard the one goat as representing the atonement made, and the other, that “for Azazel,” as representing the effect of the great work of atonement (viz., the complete removal of sin), is certainly to be preferred. The one goat which was “for Jehovah” was offered as a sin-offering, by which atonement was made. But the sins must also be visibly banished, and therefore they were symbolically laid by confession on the other goat, which was then “sent away for Azazel” into the wilderness. The form of this word indicates intensity, and therefore signifies the total separation of sin: it was wholly carried away. It was important that the result of the sacrifices offered by the high priest alone in the sanctuary should be embodied in a visible transaction, and hence the dismissal of the “scape-goat.” It was of no consequence what became of it, as the whole import of the transaction lay in its being sent into the wilderness bearing away sin. As the goat “for Jehovah” was to witness to the demerit of sin and the need of the blood of atonement, so the goat “for Azazel” was to witness to the efficacy of the sacrifice and the result of the shedding of blood in the taking away of sin.",0.0,place,azazel_127,,azazel_127

"Babel, tower of",692,b-p35.9,"Babel, tower of","The name given to the tower which the primitive fathers of our race built in the land of Shinar after the Deluge ([Gen. 11:1-9](/gen#Gen.11.1)). Their object in building this tower was probably that it might be seen as a rallying-point in the extensive plain of Shinar, to which they had emigrated from the uplands of Armenia, and so prevent their being scattered abroad. But God interposed and defeated their design by condounding their language, and hence the name Babel, meaning “confusion.” In the Babylonian tablets there is an account of this event, and also of the creation and the deluge.

 The Temple of Belus, which is supposed to occupy its site, is described by the Greek historian Herodotus as a temple of great extent and magnificence, erected by the Babylonians for their god Belus. The treasures Nebuchadnezzar brought from Jerusalem were laid up in this temple ([2 Chr. 36:7](/2chr#2Chr.36.7)).

 The Birs Nimrud, at ancient Borsippa, about 7 miles south-west of Hillah, the modern town which occupies a part of the site of ancient Babylon, and 6 miles from the Euphrates, is an immense mass of broken and fire-blasted fragments, of about 2,300 feet in circumference, rising suddenly to the height of 235 feet above the desert-plain, and is with probability regarded as the ruins of the tower of Babel. This is “one of the most imposing ruins in the country.” Others think it to be the ruins of the Temple of Belus.",0.0,unmatched,unmatched,,babel_150
Babylon,693,b-p38.1,Babylon,"The Greek form of BABEL; Semitic form Babilu, meaning “The Gate of God.” In the Assyrian tablets it means “The city of the dispersion of the tribes.” The monumental list of its kings reaches back to B.C. 2300, and includes Khammurabi, or Amraphel (q.v.), the contemporary of Abraham. It stood on the Euphrates, about 200 miles above its junction with the Tigris, which flowed through its midst and divided it into two almost equal parts. The Elamites invaded Chaldea (i.e., Lower Mesopotamia, or Shinar, and Upper Mesopotamia, or Accad, now combined into one) and held it in subjection. At length Khammu-rabi delivered it from the foreign yoke, and founded the new empire of Chaldea (q.v.), making Babylon the capital of the united kingdom. This city gradually grew in extent and grandeur, but in process of time it became subject to Assyria. On the fall of Nineveh (B.C. 606) it threw off the Assyrian yoke, and became the capital of the growing Babylonian empire. Under Nebuchadnezzar it became one of the most splendid cities of the ancient world.

 After passing through various vicissitudes the city was occupied by Cyrus, “king of Elam,” B.C. 538, who issued a decree permitting the Jews to return to their own land ([Ezra 1](/ezra#Ezra.1)). It then ceased to be the capital of an empire. It was again and again visited by hostile armies, till its inhabitants were all driven from their homes, and the city became a complete desolation, its very site being forgotten from among men.

 On the west bank of the Euphrates, about 50 miles south of Bagdad, there is found a series of artificial mounds of vast extent. These are the ruins of this once famous proud city. These ruins are principally (1) the great mound called Babil by the Arabs. This was probably the noted Temple of Belus, which was a pyramid about 480 feet high. (2) The Kasr (i.e., “the palace”). This was the great palace of Nebuchadnezzar. It is almost a square, each side of which is about 700 feet long. The little town of Hillah, near the site of Babylon, is built almost wholly of bricks taken from this single mound. (3) A lofty mound, on the summit of which stands a modern tomb called Amran ibn-Ali. This is probably the most ancient portion of the remains of the city, and represents the ruins of the famous hanging-gardens, or perhaps of some royal palace. The utter desolation of the city once called “The glory of kingdoms” ([Isa. 13:19](/isa#Isa.13.19)) was foretold by the prophets ([Isa. 13:4-22](/isa#Isa.13.4); [Jer. 25:12](/jer#Jer.25.12); [50:2](/jer#Jer.50.2), [3](/jer#Jer.50.3); [Dan. 2:31-38](/dan#Dan.2.31)).

 The Babylon mentioned in [1 Pet. 5:13](/1pet#1Pet.5.13) was not Rome, as some have thought, but the literal city of Babylon, which was inhabited by many Jews at the time Peter wrote.

 In [Rev. 14:8](/rev#Rev.14.8); [16:19](/rev#Rev.16.19); [17:5](/rev#Rev.17.5); and 18:2, “Babylon” is supposed to mean Rome, not considered as pagan, but as the prolongation of the ancient power in the papal form. Rome, pagan and papal, is regarded as one power. “The literal Babylon was the beginner and supporter of tyranny and idolatry...This city and its whole empire were taken by the Persians under Cyrus; the Persians were subdued by the Macedonians, and the Macedonians by the Romans; so that Rome succeeded to the power of old Babylon. And it was her method to adopt the worship of the false deities she had conquered; so that by her own act she became the heiress and successor of all the Babylonian idolatry, and of all that was introduced into it by the immediate successors of Babylon, and consequently of all the idolatry of the earth.” Rome, or “mystical Babylon,” is “that great city which reigneth over the kings of the earth” (17:18).",0.0,place,babylon_151,,babylon_151

"Babylon, kingdom of",695,b-p44.2,"Babylon, kingdom of","Called “the land of the Chaldeans” ([Jer. 24:5](/jer#Jer.24.5); Ezek, 12:13), was an extensive province in Central Asia along the valley of the Tigris from the Persian Gulf northward for some 300 miles. It was famed for its fertility and its riches. Its capital was the city of Babylon, a great commercial centre ([Ezek. 17:4](/ezek#Ezek.17.4); [Isa. 43:14](/isa#Isa.43.14)). Babylonia was divided into the two districts of Accad in the north, and Summer (probably the Shinar of the Old Testament) in the south. Among its chief cities may be mentioned Ur (now Mugheir or Mugayyar), on the western bank of the Euphrates; Uruk, or Erech ([Gen. 10:10](/gen#Gen.10.10)) (now Warka), between Ur and Babylon; Larsa (now Senkereh), the Ellasar of [Gen. 14:1](/gen#Gen.14.1), a little to the east of Erech; Nipur (now Niffer), south-east of Babylon; Sepharvaim ([2 Kings 17:24](/2kgs#2Kgs.17.24)), “the two Sipparas” (now Abu-Habba), considerably to the north of Babylon; and Eridu, “the good city” (now Abu-Shahrein), which lay originally on the shore of the Persian Gulf, but is now, owing to the silting up of the sand, about 100 miles distant from it. Another city was Kulunu, or Calneh ([Gen. 10:10](/gen#Gen.10.10)).

 The salt-marshes at the mouths of the Euphrates and Tigris were called Marratu, “the bitter” or “salt”, the Merathaim of [Jer. 50:21](/jer#Jer.50.21). They were the original home of the Kalda, or Chaldeans.

 The most famous of the early kings of Babylonia were Sargon of Accad (B.C. 3800) and his son, Naram-Sin, who conquered a large part of Western Asia, establishing their power in Palestine, and even carrying their arms to the Sinaitic peninsula. A great Babylonian library was founded in the reign of Sargon. Babylonia was subsequently again broken up into more than one state, and at one time fell under the domination of Elam. This was put an end to by Khammu-rabi (Amraphel), who drove the Elamites out of the country, and overcame Arioch, the son of an Elamite prince. From this time forward Babylonia was a united monarchy. About B.C. 1750 it was conquered by the Kassi, or Kosseans, from the mountains of Elam, and a Kassite dynasty ruled over it for 576 years and 9 months.

 In the time of Khammu-rabi, Syria and Palestine were subject to Babylonia and its Elamite suzerain; and after the overthrow of the Elamite supremacy, the Babylonian kings continued to exercise their influence and power in what was called “the land of the Amorites.” In the epoch of the Kassite dynasty, however, Canaan passed into the hands of Egypt.

 In B.C. 729, Babylonia was conquered by the Assyrian king Tiglath-pileser III.; but on the death of Shalmaneser IV. it was seized by the Kalda or “Chaldean” prince Merodach-baladan ([2 Kings 20:12-19](/2kgs#2Kgs.20.12)), who held it till B.C. 709, when he was driven out by Sargon.

 Under Sennacherib, Babylonia revolted from Assyria several times, with the help of the Elamites, and after one of these revolts Babylon was destroyed by Sennacherib, B.C. 689. It was rebuilt by Esarhaddon, who made it his residence during part of the year, and it was to Babylon that Manasseh was brought a prisoner ([2 Chr. 33:11](/2chr#2Chr.33.11)). After the death of Esarhaddon, Saul-sumyukin, the viceroy of Babylonia, revolted against his brother the Assyrian king, and the revolt was suppressed with difficulty.

 When Nineveh was destroyed, B.C. 606, Nabopolassar, the viceroy of Babylonia, who seems to have been of Chaldean descent, made himself independent. His son Nebuchadrezzar (Nabu-kudur-uzur), after defeating the Egyptians at Carchemish, succeeded him as king, B.C. 604, and founded the Babylonian empire. He strongly fortified Babylon, and adorned it with palaces and other buildings. His son, Evil-merodach, who succeeded him in B.C. 561, was murdered after a reign of two years. The last monarch of the Babylonian empire was Nabonidus (Nabu-nahid), B.C. 555-538, whose eldest son, Belshazzar (Bilu-sar-uzur), is mentioned in several inscriptions. Babylon was captured by Cyrus, B.C. 538, and though it revolted more than once in later years, it never succeeded in maintaining its independence.",0.0,unmatched,unmatched,,

Though the badger is common in Palestine, and might occur in the wilderness, its small hide would have been useless as a tent covering. The dugong, very plentiful in the shallow waters on the shores of the Red Sea, is a marine animal from 12 to 30 feet long, something between a whale and a seal, never leaving the water, but very easily caught.

It is evident that though dwelling among idolaters he had some knowledge of the true God; and was held in such reputation that it was supposed that he whom he blessed was blessed, and he whom he cursed was cursed. When the Israelites were encamped on the plains of Moab, on the east of Jordan, by Jericho, Balak sent for Balaam “from Aram, out of the mountains of the east,” to curse them; but by the remarkable interposition of God he was utterly unable to fulfil Balak’s wish, however desirous he was to do so.

Banquet,733,b-p87.4,Banquet,"A feast provided for the entertainment of a company of guests ([Esther 5](/esth#Esth.5); [7](/esth#Esth.7); [1 Pet. 4:3](/1pet#1Pet.4.3)); such as was provided for our Lord by his friends in Bethany ([Matt. 26:6](/matt#Matt.26.6); [Mark 14:3](/mark#Mark.14.3); comp. [John 12:2](/john#John.12.2)). These meals were in the days of Christ usually called “suppers,” after the custom of the Romans, and were partaken of toward the close of the day. It was usual to send a second invitation ([Matt. 22:3](/matt#Matt.22.3); [Luke 14:17](/luke#Luke.14.17)) to those who had been already invited. When the whole company was assembled, the master of the house shut the door with his own hands ([Luke 13:25](/luke#Luke.13.25); [Matt. 25:10](/matt#Matt.25.10)).

 The guests were first refreshed with water and fragrant oil ([Luke 7:38](/luke#Luke.7.38); [Mark 7:4](/mark#Mark.7.4)). A less frequent custom was that of supplying each guest with a robe to be worn during the feast ([Eccles. 9:8](/eccl#Eccl.9.8); [Rev. 3:4](/rev#Rev.3.4), [5](/rev#Rev.3.5); [Matt. 22:11](/matt#Matt.22.11)). At private banquets the master of the house presided; but on public occasions a “governor of the feast” was chosen ([John 2:8](/john#John.2.8)). The guests were placed in order according to seniority ([Gen. 43:33](/gen#Gen.43.33)), or according to the rank they held ([Prov. 25:6](/prov#Prov.25.6), [7](/prov#Prov.25.7); [Matt. 23:6](/matt#Matt.23.6); [Luke 14:7](/luke#Luke.14.7)).

 As spoons and knives and forks are a modern invention, and were altogether unknown in the East, the hands alone were necessarily used, and were dipped in the dish, which was common to two of the guests ([John 13:26](/john#John.13.26)). In the days of our Lord the guests reclined at table; but the ancient Israelites sat around low tables, cross-legged, like the modern Orientals. Guests were specially honoured when extra portions were set before them ([Gen. 43:34](/gen#Gen.43.34)), and when their cup was filled with wine till it ran over ([Ps. 23:5](/ps#Ps.23.5)). The hands of the guests were usually cleaned by being rubbed on bread, the crumbs of which fell to the ground, and were the portion for dogs ([Matt. 15:27](/matt#Matt.15.27); [Luke 16:21](/luke#Luke.16.21)).

 At the time of the three annual festivals at Jerusalem family banquets were common. To these the “widow, and the fatherless, and the stranger” were welcome ([Deut. 16:11](/deut#Deut.16.11)).

"Baptism, Christian",734,b-p91.15,"Baptism, Christian","An ordinance immediately instituted by Christ ([Matt. 28:19](/matt#Matt.28.19), [20](/matt#Matt.28.20)), and designed to be observed in the church, like that of the Supper, “till he come.” The words “baptize” and “baptism” are simply Greek words transferred into English. This was necessarily done by the translators of the Scriptures, for no literal translation could properly express all that is implied in them.

 The mode of baptism can in no way be determined from the Greek word rendered “baptize.” Baptists say that it means “to dip,” and nothing else. That is an incorrect view of the meaning of the word. It means both (1) to dip a thing into an element or liquid, and (2) to put an element or liquid over or on it. Nothing therefore as to the mode of baptism can be concluded from the mere word used. The word has a wide latitude of meaning, not only in the New Testament, but also in the LXX. Version of the Old Testament, where it is used of the ablutions and baptisms required by the Mosaic law. These were effected by immersion, and by affusion and sprinkling; and the same word, “washings” ([Heb. 9:10](/heb#Heb.9.10), [13](/heb#Heb.9.13), [19](/heb#Heb.9.19), [21](/heb#Heb.9.21)) or “baptisms,” designates them all. In the New Testament there cannot be found a single well-authenticated instance of the occurrence of the word where it necessarily means immersion. Moreover, none of the instances of baptism recorded in the Acts of the Apostles (2:38-41; 8:26-39; 9:17, 18; 22:12-16; 10:44-48; 16:32-34) favours the idea that it was by dipping the person baptized, or by immersion, while in some of them such a mode was highly improbable.

 The gospel and its ordinances are designed for the whole world, and it cannot be supposed that a form for the administration of baptism would have been prescribed which would in any place (as in a tropical country or in polar regions) or under any circumstances be inapplicable or injurious or impossible.

 Baptism and the Lord’s Supper are the two symbolical ordinances of the New Testament. The Supper represents the work of Christ, and Baptism the work of the Spirit. As in the Supper a small amount of bread and wine used in this ordinance exhibits in symbol the great work of Christ, so in Baptism the work of the Holy Spirit is fully seen in the water poured or sprinkled on the person in the name of the Father, Son, and Holy Ghost. That which is essential in baptism is only “washing with water,” no mode being specified and none being necessary or essential to the symbolism of the ordinance.

 The apostles of our Lord were baptized with the Holy Ghost ([Matt. 3:11](/matt#Matt.3.11)) by his coming upon them ([Acts 1:8](/acts#Acts.1.8)). The fire also with which they were baptized sat upon them. The extraordinary event of Pentecost was explained by Peter as a fulfilment of the ancient promise that the Spirit would be poured out in the last days (2:17). He uses also with the same reference the expression shed forth as descriptive of the baptism of the Spirit (33). In the Pentecostal baptism “the apostles were not dipped into the Spirit, nor plunged into the Spirit; but the Spirit was shed forth, poured out, fell on them (11:15), came upon them, sat on them.” That was a real and true baptism. We are warranted from such language to conclude that in like manner when water is poured out, falls, comes upon or rests upon a person when this ordinance is administered, that person is baptized. Baptism is therefore, in view of all these arguments “rightly administered by pouring or sprinkling water upon the person.”

 The subjects of baptism. This raises questions of greater importance than those relating to its mode.

 1. The controversy here is not about “believers’ baptism,” for that is common to all parties. Believers were baptized in apostolic times, and they have been baptized in all time by all the branches of the church. It is altogether a misrepresentation to allege, as is sometimes done by Baptists, that their doctrine is “believers’ baptism.” Every instance of adult baptism, or of “believers’ baptism,” recorded in the New Testament ([Acts 2:41](/acts#Acts.2.41); [8:37](/acts#Acts.8.37); [9:17](/acts#Acts.9.17), [18](/acts#Acts.9.18); [10:47](/acts#Acts.10.47); [16:15](/acts#Acts.16.15); [19:5](/acts#Acts.19.5), etc.) is just such as would be dealt with in precisely the same way by all branches of the Protestant Church, a profession of faith or of their being “believers” would be required from every one of them before baptism. The point in dispute is not the baptism of believers, but whether the infant children of believers, i.e., of members of the church, ought to be baptized.

 2. In support of the doctrine of infant baptism, i.e., of the baptism of the infants, or rather the “children,” of believing parents, the following considerations may be adduced:

 The Church of Christ exists as a divinely organized community. It is the “kingdom of God,” one historic kingdom under all dispensations. The commonwealth of Israel was the “church” ([Acts 7:38](/acts#Acts.7.38); [Rom. 9:4](/rom#Rom.9.4)) under the Mosaic dispensation. The New Testament church is not a new and different church, but one with that of the Old Testament. The terms of admission into the church have always been the same viz., a profession of faith and a promise of subjection to the laws of the kingdom. Now it is a fact beyond dispute that the children of God’s people under the old dispensation were recognized as members of the church. Circumcision was the sign and seal of their membership. It was not because of carnal descent from Abraham, but as being the children of God’s professing people, that this rite was administered ([Rom. 4:11](/rom#Rom.4.11)). If children were members of the church under the old dispensation, which they undoubtedly were, then they are members of the church now by the same right, unless it can be shown that they have been expressly excluded. Under the Old Testament parents acted for their children and represented them. (See [Gen. 9:9](/gen#Gen.9.9); [17:10](/gen#Gen.17.10); [Ex. 24:7](/exod#Exod.24.7), [8](/exod#Exod.24.8); [Deut. 29:9-13](/deut#Deut.29.9).) When parents entered into covenant with God, they brought their children with them. This was a law in the Hebrew Church. When a proselyte was received into membership, he could not enter without bringing his children with him. The New Testament does not exclude the children of believers from the church. It does not deprive them of any privilege they enjoyed under the Old Testament. There is no command or statement of any kind, that can be interpreted as giving any countenance to such an idea, anywhere to be found in the New Testament. The church membership of infants has never been set aside. The ancient practice, orginally appointed by God himself, must remain a law of his kingdom till repealed by the same divine authority. There are lambs in the fold of the Good Shepherd ([John 21:15](/john#John.21.15); comp. [Luke 1:15](/luke#Luke.1.15); [Matt. 19:14](/matt#Matt.19.14); [1 Cor. 7:14](/1cor#1Cor.7.14)).

 “In a company of converts applying for admission into Christ’s house there are likely to be some heads of families. How is their case to be treated? How, for example, are Lydia and her neighbour the keeper of the city prison to be treated? Both have been converted. Both are heads of families. They desire to be received into the infant church of Philippi. What is Christ’s direction to them? Shall we say that it is to this effect: ’Arise, and wash away your sins, and come into my house. But you must come in by yourselves. These babes in your arms, you must leave them outside. They cannot believe yet, and so they cannot come in. Those other little ones by your side, their hearts may perhaps have been touched with the love of God; still, they are not old enough to make a personal profession, so they too must be left outside...For the present you must leave them where they are and come in by yourselves.’ One may reasonably demand very stringent proofs before accepting this as a fair representation of the sort of welcome Christ offers to parents who come to his door bringing their children with them. Surely it is more consonant with all we know about him to suppose that his welcome will be more ample in its scope, and will breathe a more gracious tone. Surely it would be more like the Good Shepherd to say, ‘Come in, and bring your little ones along with you. The youngest needs my salvation; and the youngest is accessible to my salvation. You may be unable as yet to deal with them about either sin or salvation, but my gracious power can find its way into their hearts even now. I can impart to them pardon and a new life. From Adam they have inherited sin and death; and I can so unite them to myself that in me they shall be heirs of righteousness and life. You may without misgiving bring them to me. And the law of my house requires that the same day which witnesses your reception into it by baptism must witness their reception also’” (The Church, by Professor Binnie, D.D.).",0.0,unmatched,unmatched,,

This expression as used by the apostle may be equivalent to saying, “He who goes through a baptism of blood in order to join a glorified church which has no existence [i.e., if the dead rise not] is a fool.” Some also regard the statement here as an allusion to the strange practice which began, it is said, to prevail at Corinth, in which a person was baptized in the stead of others who had died before being baptized, to whom it was hoped some of the benefits of that rite would be extended.

Baptism of Christ,737,b-p103.3,Baptism of Christ,"Christ had to be formally inaugurated into the public discharge of his offices. For this purpose he came to John, who was the representative of the law and the prophets, that by him he might be introduced into his offices, and thus be publicly recognized as the Messiah of whose coming the prophecies and types had for many ages borne witness.

 John refused at first to confer his baptism on Christ, for he understood not what he had to do with the “baptism of repentance.” But Christ said, ”‘Suffer it to be so now,’ NOW as suited to my state of humiliation, my state as a substitute in the room of sinners.” His reception of baptism was not necessary on his own account. It was a voluntary act, the same as his act of becoming incarnate. Yet if the work he had engaged to accomplish was to be completed, then it became him to take on him the likeness of a sinner, and to fulfil all righteousness ([Matt. 3:15](/matt#Matt.3.15)).

 The official duty of Christ and the sinless person of Christ are to be distinguished. It was in his official capacity that he submitted to baptism. In coming to John our Lord virtually said, “Though sinless, and without any personal taint, yet in my public or official capacity as the Sent of God, I stand in the room of many, and bring with me the sin of the world, for which I am the propitiation.” Christ was not made under the law on his own account. It was as surety of his people, a position which he spontaneously assumed. The administration of the rite of baptism was also a symbol of the baptism of suffering before him in this official capacity ([Luke 12:50](/luke#Luke.12.50)).

Barnabas,752,b-p120.5,Barnabas,"Son of consolation, the surname of Joses, a Levite ([Acts 4:36](/acts#Acts.4.36)). His name stands first on the list of prophets and teachers of the church at Antioch (13:1). Luke speaks of him as a “good man” (11:24). He was born of Jewish parents of the tribe of Levi. He was a native of Cyprus, where he had a possession of land ([Acts 4:36](/acts#Acts.4.36), [37](/acts#Acts.4.37)), which he sold. His personal appearance is supposed to have been dignified and commanding ([Acts 14:11](/acts#Acts.14.11), [12](/acts#Acts.14.12)). When Paul returned to Jerusalem after his conversion, Barnabas took him and introduced him to the apostles (9:27). They had probably been companions as students in the school of Gamaliel.

 The prosperity of the church at Antioch led the apostles and brethren at Jerusalem to send Barnabas thither to superintend the movement. He found the work so extensive and weighty that he went to Tarsus in search of Saul to assist him. Saul returned with him to Antioch and laboured with him for a whole year ([Acts 11:25](/acts#Acts.11.25), [26](/acts#Acts.11.26)). The two were at the end of this period sent up to Jerusalem with the contributions the church at Antioch had made for the poorer brethren there (11:28-30). Shortly after they returned, bringing John Mark with them, they were appointed as missionaries to the heathen world, and in this capacity visited Cyprus and some of the principal cities of Asia Minor ([Acts 13:14](/acts#Acts.13.14)). Returning from this first missionary journey to Antioch, they were again sent up to Jerusalem to consult with the church there regarding the relation of Gentiles to the church ([Acts 15:2](/acts#Acts.15.2): [Gal. 2:1](/gal#Gal.2.1)). This matter having been settled, they returned again to Antioch, bringing the decree of the council as the rule by which Gentiles were to be admitted into the church.

 When about to set forth on a second missionary journey, a dispute arose between Saul and Barnabas as to the propriety of taking John Mark with them again. The dispute ended by Saul and Barnabas taking separate routes. Saul took Silas as his companion, and journeyed through Syria and Cilicia; while Barnabas took his nephew John Mark, and visited Cyprus ([Acts 15:36-41](/acts#Acts.15.36)).

He was the son of Nabonidus by Nitocris, who was the daughter of Nebuchadnezzar and the widow of Nergal-sharezer. When still young he made a great feast to a thousand of his lords, and when heated with wine sent for the sacred vessels his “father” ([Dan. 5:2](/dan#Dan.5.2)), or grandfather, Nebuchadnezzar had carried away from the temple in Jerusalem, and he and his princes drank out of them. In the midst of their mad revelry a hand was seen by the king tracing on the wall the announcement of God’s judgment, which that night fell upon him. At the instance of the queen (i.e., his mother) Daniel was brought in, and he interpreted the writing. That night the kingdom of the Chaldeans came to an end, and the king was slain ([Dan. 5:30](/dan#Dan.5.30)).

 The absence of the name of Belshazzar on the monuments was long regarded as an argument against the genuineness of the Book of Daniel. In 1854 Sir Henry Rawlinson found an inscription of Nabonidus which referred to his eldest son. Quite recently, however, the side of a ravine undermined by heavy rains fell at Hillah, a suburb of Babylon. A number of huge, coarse earthenware vases were laid bare. These were filled with tablets, the receipts and contracts of a firm of Babylonian bankers, which showed that Belshazzar had a household, with secretaries and stewards. One was dated in the third year of the king Marduk-sar-uzur. As Marduk-sar-uzar was another name for Baal, this Marduk-sar-uzur was found to be the Belshazzar of Scripture. In one of these contract tablets, dated in the July after the defeat of the army of Nabonidus, we find him paying tithes for his sister to the temple of the sun-god at Sippara.",0.0,person,belshazzar_437,belshazzar_437,

Benjamin 1,862,b-p230.3,Benjamin,"The younger son of Jacob by Rachel ([Gen. 35:18](/gen#Gen.35.18)). His birth took place at Ephrath, on the road between Bethel and Bethlehem, at a short distance from the latter place. His mother died in giving him birth, and with her last breath named him Ben-oni, son of my pain, a name which was changed by his father into Benjamin. His posterity are called Benjamites ([Gen. 49:27](/gen#Gen.49.27); [Deut. 33:12](/deut#Deut.33.12); [Josh. 18:21](/josh#Josh.18.21)).

 The tribe of Benjamin at the Exodus was the smallest but one ([Num. 1:36](/num#Num.1.36), [37](/num#Num.1.37); [Ps. 68:27](/ps#Ps.68.27)). During the march its place was along with Manasseh and Ephraim on the west of the tabernacle. At the entrance into Canaan it counted 45,600 warriors. It has been inferred by some from the words of Jacob ([Gen. 49:27](/gen#Gen.49.27)) that the figure of a wolf was on the tribal standard. This tribe is mentioned in [Rom. 11:1](/rom#Rom.11.1); [Phil. 3:5](/phil#Phil.3.5).

 The inheritance of this tribe lay immediately to the south of that of Ephraim, and was about 26 miles in length and 12 in breadth. Its eastern boundary was the Jordan. Dan intervened between it and the Philistines. Its chief towns are named in [Josh. 18:21-28](/josh#Josh.18.21).

 The history of the tribe contains a sad record of a desolating civil war in which they were engaged with the other eleven tribes. By it they were almost exterminated ([Judg. 20:20](/judg#Judg.20.20), [21](/judg#Judg.20.21); 21:10).

 The first king of the Jews was Saul, a Benjamite. A close alliance was formed between this tribe and that of Judah in the time of David ([2 Sam. 19:16](/2sam#2Sam.19.16), [17](/2sam#2Sam.19.17)), which continued after his death ([1 Kings 11:13](/1kgs#1Kgs.11.13); [12:20](/1kgs#1Kgs.12.20)). After the Exile these two tribes formed the great body of the Jewish nation ([Ezra 1:5](/ezra#Ezra.1.5); [10:9](/ezra#Ezra.10.9)).

 The tribe of Benjamin was famous for its archers ([1 Sam. 20:20](/1sam#1Sam.20.20), [36](/1sam#1Sam.20.36); [2 Sam. 1:22](/2sam#2Sam.1.22); [1 Chr. 8:40](/1chr#1Chr.8.40); [12:2](/1chr#1Chr.12.2)) and slingers (Judge. 20:6).

Bethel 1,908,b-p274.3,Bethel,"A place in Central Palestine, about 10 miles north of Jerusalem, at the head of the pass of Michmash and Ai. It was originally the royal Canaanite city of Luz ([Gen. 28:19](/gen#Gen.28.19)). The name Bethel was at first apparently given to the sanctuary in the neighbourhood of Luz, and was not given to the city itself till after its conquest by the tribe of Ephraim. When Abram entered Canaan he formed his second encampment between Bethel and Hai ([Gen. 12:8](/gen#Gen.12.8)); and on his return from Egypt he came back to it, and again “called upon the name of the Lord” (13:4). Here Jacob, on his way from Beersheba to Haran, had a vision of the angels of God ascending and descending on the ladder whose top reached unto heaven (28:10, 19); and on his return he again visited this place, “where God talked with him” (35:1-15), and there he “built an altar, and called the place El-beth-el” (q.v.). To this second occasion of God’s speaking with Jacob at Bethel, Hosea (12:4, 5) makes reference.

 In troublous times the people went to Bethel to ask counsel of God ([Judg. 20:18](/judg#Judg.20.18), [31](/judg#Judg.20.31); 21:2). Here the ark of the covenant was kept for a long time under the care of Phinehas, the grandson of Aaron (20:26-28). Here also Samuel held in rotation his court of justice ([1 Sam. 7:16](/1sam#1Sam.7.16)). It was included in Israel after the kingdom was divided, and it became one of the seats of the worship of the golden calf ([1 Kings 12:28-33](/1kgs#1Kgs.12.28); [13:1](/1kgs#1Kgs.13.1)). Hence the prophet Hosea ([Hos. 4:15](/hos#Hos.4.15); [5:8](/hos#Hos.5.8); [10:5](/hos#Hos.10.5), [8](/hos#Hos.10.8)) calls it in contempt Beth-aven, i.e., “house of idols.” Bethel remained an abode of priests even after the kingdom of Israel was desolated by the king of Assyria ([2 Kings 17:28](/2kgs#2Kgs.17.28), [29](/2kgs#2Kgs.17.29)). At length all traces of the idolatries were extirpated by Josiah, king of Judah ([2 Kings 23:15-18](/2kgs#2Kgs.23.15)); and the place was still in existence after the Captivity ([Ezra 2:28](/ezra#Ezra.2.28); [Neh. 7:32](/neh#Neh.7.32)).

They are distinguished as Beth-horon “the upper” and Beth-horon “the nether.” They are about 2 miles apart, the former being about 10 miles north-west of Jerusalem. Between the two places was the ascent and descent of Beth-horon, leading from Gibeon down to the western plain ([Josh. 10:10](/josh#Josh.10.10), [11](/josh#Josh.10.11); 18:13, 14), down which the five kings of the Amorites were driven by Joshua in that great battle, the most important in which the Hebrews had been as yet engaged, being their first conflict with their enemies in the open field.

It is first noticed in Scripture as the place where Rachel died and was buried “by the wayside,” directly to the north of the city ([Gen. 48:7](/gen#Gen.48.7)). The valley to the east was the scene of the story of Ruth the Moabitess. There are the fields in which she gleaned, and the path by which she and Naomi returned to the town. Here was David’s birth-place, and here also, in after years, he was anointed as king by Samuel ([1 Sam. 16:4-13](/1sam#1Sam.16.4)); and it was from the well of Bethlehem that three of his heroes brought water for him at the risk of their lives when he was in the cave of Adullam ([2 Sam. 23:13-17](/2sam#2Sam.23.13)). But it was distinguished above every other city as the birth-place of “Him whose goings forth have been of old” ([Matt. 2:6](/matt#Matt.2.6); comp. [Micah 5:2](/mic#Mic.5.2)).

 It is divided into the Old Testament, containing thirty-nine books, and the New Testament, containing twenty-seven books. The names given to the Old in the writings of the New are “the scriptures” ([Matt. 21:42](/matt#Matt.21.42)), “scripture” (2 Pet. 1:20), “the holy scriptures” ([Rom. 1:2](/rom#Rom.1.2)), “the law” ([John 12:34](/john#John.12.34)), “the law of Moses, the prophets, and the psalms” ([Luke 24:44](/luke#Luke.24.44)), “the law and the prophets” ([Matt. 5:17](/matt#Matt.5.17)), “the old covenant” ([2 Cor. 3:14](/2cor#2Cor.3.14), R.V.). There is a break of 400 years between the Old Testament and the New.

 The Old Testament is divided into three parts:, 1. The Law (Torah), consisting of the Pentateuch, or five books of Moses. 2. The Prophets, consisting of (1) the former, namely, Joshua, Judges, the Books of Samuel, and the Books of Kings; (2) the latter, namely, the greater prophets, Isaiah, Jeremiah, and Ezekiel, and the twelve minor prophets. 3. The Hagiographa, or holy writings, including the rest of the books. These were ranked in three divisions:, (1) The Psalms, Proverbs, and Job, distinguished by the Hebrew name, a word formed of the initial letters of these books, emeth, meaning truth. (2) Canticles, Ruth, Lamentations, Ecclesiastes, and Esther, called the five rolls, as being written for the synagogue use on five separate rolls. (3) Daniel, Ezra, Nehemiah, and 1 and 2 Chronicles. Between the Old and the New Testament no addition was made to the revelation God had already given. The period of New Testament revelation, extending over a century, began with the appearance of John the Baptist.

 The New Testament consists of (1) the historical books, viz., the Gospels, and the Acts of the Apostles; (2) the Epistles; and (3) the book of prophecy, the Revelation.

 The division of the Bible into chapters and verses is altogether of human invention, designed to facilitate reference to it. The ancient Jews divided the Old Testament into certain sections for use in the synagogue service, and then at a later period, in the ninth century A.D., into verses. Our modern system of chapters for all the books of the Bible was introduced by Cardinal Hugo about the middle of the thirteenth century (he died 1263). The system of verses for the New Testament was introduced by Stephens in 1551, and generally adopted, although neither Tyndale’s nor Coverdale’s English translation of the Bible has verses. The division is not always wisely made, yet it is very useful.",0.0,unmatched,unmatched,,

 Books were originally written on skins, on linen or cotton cloth, and on Egyptian papyrus, whence our word “paper.” The leaves of the book were generally written in columns, designated by a Hebrew word properly meaning “doors” and “valves” ([Jer. 36:23](/jer#Jer.36.23), R.V., marg. “columns”).

 Among the Hebrews books were generally rolled up like our maps, or if very long they were rolled from both ends, forming two rolls ([Luke 4:17-20](/luke#Luke.4.17)). Thus they were arranged when the writing was on flexible materials; but if the writing was on tablets of wood or brass or lead, then the several tablets were bound together by rings through which a rod was passed.

 The “abominable branch” is a tree on which a malefactor has been hanged ([Isa. 14:19](/isa#Isa.14.19)). The “highest branch” in [Ezek. 17:3](/ezek#Ezek.17.3) represents Jehoiakim the king.",0.0,unmatched,unmatched,,

 The Macedonian empire is described as a kingdom of brass ([Dan. 2:39](/dan#Dan.2.39)). The “mountains of brass” Zechariah (6:1) speaks of have been supposed to represent the immutable decrees of God.

 The serpent of brass was made by Moses at the command of God ([Num. 21:4-9](/num#Num.21.4)), and elevated on a pole, so that it might be seen by all the people when wounded by the bite of the serpents that were sent to them as a punishment for their murmurings against God and against Moses. It was afterwards carried by the Jews into Canaan, and preserved by them till the time of Hezekiah, who caused it to be at length destroyed because it began to be viewed by the people with superstitious reverence ([2 Kings 18:4](/2kgs#2Kgs.18.4)).

Bread,1040,b-p419.6,Bread,"Among the Jews was generally made of wheat ([Ex. 29:2](/exod#Exod.29.2); [Judg. 6:19](/judg#Judg.6.19)), though also sometimes of other grains ([Gen. 14:18](/gen#Gen.14.18); [Judg. 7:13](/judg#Judg.7.13)). Parched grain was sometimes used for food without any other preparation ([Ruth 2:14](/ruth#Ruth.2.14)).

 Bread was prepared by kneading in wooden bowls or “kneading troughs” ([Gen. 18:6](/gen#Gen.18.6); [Ex. 12:34](/exod#Exod.12.34); [Jer. 7:18](/jer#Jer.7.18)). The dough was mixed with leaven and made into thin cakes, round or oval, and then baked. The bread eaten at the Passover was always unleavened ([Ex. 12:15-20](/exod#Exod.12.15); [Deut. 16:3](/deut#Deut.16.3)). In the towns there were public ovens, which were much made use of for baking bread; there were also bakers by trade ([Hos. 7:4](/hos#Hos.7.4); [Jer. 37:21](/jer#Jer.37.21)). Their ovens were not unlike those of modern times. But sometimes the bread was baked by being placed on the ground that had been heated by a fire, and by covering it with the embers ([1 Kings 19:6](/1kgs#1Kgs.19.6)). This was probably the mode in which Sarah prepared bread on the occasion referred to in [Gen. 18:6](/gen#Gen.18.6).

 In [Lev. 2](/lev#Lev.2) there is an account of the different kinds of bread and cakes used by the Jews.

 The shew-bread (q.v.) consisted of twelve loaves of unleavened bread prepared and presented hot on the golden table every Sabbath. They were square or oblong, and represented the twelve tribes of Israel. The old loaves were removed every Sabbath, and were to be eaten only by the priests in the court of the sanctuary ([Ex. 25:30](/exod#Exod.25.30); [Lev. 24:8](/lev#Lev.24.8); [1 Sam. 21:1-6](/1sam#1Sam.21.1); [Matt. 12:4](/matt#Matt.12.4)).

 The word bread is used figuratively in such expressions as “bread of sorrows” ([Ps. 127:2](/ps#Ps.127.2)), “bread of tears” (80:5), i.e., sorrow and tears are like one’s daily bread, they form so great a part in life.

Much building was carried on in Solomon’s time. Besides the buildings he completed at Jerusalem, he also built Baalath and Tadmor ([1 Kings 9:15](/1kgs#1Kgs.9.15), [24](/1kgs#1Kgs.9.24)). Many of the kings of Israel and Judah were engaged in erecting various buildings.

 Herod and his sons and successors restored the temple, and built fortifications and other structures of great magnificence in Jerusalem ([Luke 21:5](/luke#Luke.21.5)).

 The instruments used in building are mentioned as the plumb-line ([Amos 7:7](/amos#Amos.7.7)), the measuring-reed ([Ezek. 40:3](/ezek#Ezek.40.3)), and the saw ([1 Kings 7:9](/1kgs#1Kgs.7.9)).

 Believers are “God’s building” ([1 Cor. 3:9](/1cor#1Cor.3.9)); and heaven is called “a building of God” ([2 Cor. 5:1](/2cor#2Cor.5.1)). Christ is the only foundation of his church ([1 Cor. 3:10-12](/1cor#1Cor.3.10)), of which he also is the builder ([Matt. 16:18](/matt#Matt.16.18)).",0.0,unmatched,unmatched,,

Burial,1100,b-p474.7,Burial,"The first burial we have an account of is that of Sarah ([Gen. 23](/gen#Gen.23)). The first commercial transaction recorded is that of the purchase of a burial-place, for which Abraham weighed to Ephron “four hundred shekels of silver current money with the merchants.” Thus the patriarch became the owner of a part of the land of Canaan, the only part he ever possessed. When he himself died, “his sons Isaac and Ishmael buried him in the cave of Machpelah,” beside Sarah his wife ([Gen. 25:9](/gen#Gen.25.9)).

 Deborah, Rebekah’s nurse, was buried under Allon-bachuth, “the oak of weeping” ([Gen. 35:8](/gen#Gen.35.8)), near to Bethel. Rachel died, and was buried near Ephrath; “and Jacob set a pillar upon her grave” (16-20). Isaac was buried at Hebron, where he had died (27, 29). Jacob, when charging his sons to bury him in the cave of Machpelah, said, “There they buried Abraham and Sarah his wife; there they buried Isaac and Rebekah his wife; and there I buried Leah” (49:31). In compliance with the oath which he made him swear unto him (47:29-31), Joseph, assisted by his brethren, buried Jacob in the cave of Machpelah (50:2, 13). At the Exodus, Moses “took the bones of Joseph with him,” and they were buried in the “parcel of ground” which Jacob had bought of the sons of Hamor ([Josh. 24:32](/josh#Josh.24.32)), which became Joseph’s inheritance ([Gen. 48:22](/gen#Gen.48.22); [1 Chr. 5:1](/1chr#1Chr.5.1); [John 4:5](/john#John.4.5)). Two burials are mentioned as having taken place in the wilderness. That of Miriam ([Num. 20:1](/num#Num.20.1)), and that of Moses, “in the land of Moab” ([Deut. 34:5](/deut#Deut.34.5), [6](/deut#Deut.34.6), [8](/deut#Deut.34.8)). There is no account of the actual burial of Aaron, which probably, however, took place on the summit of Mount Hor ([Num. 20:28](/num#Num.20.28), [29](/num#Num.20.29)).

 Joshua was buried “in the border of his inheritance in Timnath-serah” ([Josh. 24](/josh#Josh.24): 30).

 In Job we find a reference to burying-places, which were probably the Pyramids (3:14, 15). The Hebrew word for “waste places” here resembles in sound the Egyptian word for “pyramids.”

 Samuel, like Moses, was honoured with a national burial ([1 Sam. 25:1](/1sam#1Sam.25.1)). Joab ([1 Kings 2:34](/1kgs#1Kgs.2.34)) “was buried in his own house in the wilderness.”

 In connection with the burial of Saul and his three sons we meet for the first time with the practice of burning the dead ([1 Sam. 31:11-13](/1sam#1Sam.31.11)). The same practice is again referred to by Amos (6:10).

 Absalom was buried “in the wood” where he was slain ([2 Sam. 18:17](/2sam#2Sam.18.17), [18](/2sam#2Sam.18.18)). The raising of the heap of stones over his grave was intended to mark abhorrence of the person buried (comp. [Josh. 7:26](/josh#Josh.7.26) and 8:29). There was no fixed royal burying-place for the Hebrew kings. We find several royal burials taking place, however, “in the city of David” ([1 Kings 2:10](/1kgs#1Kgs.2.10); [11:43](/1kgs#1Kgs.11.43); [15:8](/1kgs#1Kgs.15.8); [2 Kings 14:19](/2kgs#2Kgs.14.19), [20](/2kgs#2Kgs.14.20); [15:38](/2kgs#2Kgs.15.38); [1 Kings 14:31](/1kgs#1Kgs.14.31); [22:50](/1kgs#1Kgs.22.50); [2 Chr. 21:19](/2chr#2Chr.21.19), [20](/2chr#2Chr.21.20); [2 Chr. 24:25](/2chr#2Chr.24.25), etc.). Hezekiah was buried in the mount of the sepulchres of the sons of David; “and all Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem did him honour at his death” ([2 Chr. 32:33](/2chr#2Chr.32.33)).

 Little is said regarding the burial of the kings of Israel. Some of them were buried in Samaria, the capital of their kingdom ([2 Kings 10:35](/2kgs#2Kgs.10.35); [13:9](/2kgs#2Kgs.13.9); [14:16](/2kgs#2Kgs.14.16)).

 Our Lord was buried in a new tomb, hewn out of the rock, which Joseph of Arimathea had prepared for himself ([Matt. 27:57-60](/matt#Matt.27.57); [Mark 15:46](/mark#Mark.15.46); [John 19:41](/john#John.19.41), [42](/john#John.19.42)).

 The grave of Lazarus was “a cave, and a stone lay on it” ([John 11:38](/john#John.11.38)). Graves were frequently either natural caverns or artificial excavations formed in the sides of rocks ([Gen. 23:9](/gen#Gen.23.9); [Matt. 27:60](/matt#Matt.27.60)); and coffins were seldom used, unless when the body was brought from a distance.",0.0,unmatched,unmatched,,
Burnt offering,1101,b-p484.4,Burnt offering,"Hebrew olah; i.e., “ascending,” the whole being consumed by fire, and regarded as ascending to God while being consumed. Part of every offering was burnt in the sacred fire, but this was wholly burnt, a “whole burnt offering.” It was the most frequent form of sacrifice, and apparently the only one mentioned in the book of Genesis. Such were the sacrifices offered by Abel ([Gen. 4:3](/gen#Gen.4.3), [4](/gen#Gen.4.4), here called minhah; i.e., “a gift”), Noah ([Gen. 8:20](/gen#Gen.8.20)), Abraham ([Gen. 22:2](/gen#Gen.22.2), [7](/gen#Gen.22.7), [8](/gen#Gen.22.8), [13](/gen#Gen.22.13)), and by the Hebrews in Egypt ([Ex. 10:25](/exod#Exod.10.25)).

 The law of Moses afterwards prescribed the occasions and the manner in which burnt sacrifices were to be offered. There were “the continual burnt offering” ([Ex. 29:38-42](/exod#Exod.29.38); [Lev. 6:9-13](/lev#Lev.6.9)), “the burnt offering of every sabbath,” which was double the daily one ([Num. 28:9](/num#Num.28.9), [10](/num#Num.28.10)), “the burnt offering of every month” (28:11-15), the offerings at the Passover (19-23), at Pentecost ([Lev. 23:16](/lev#Lev.23.16)), the feast of Trumpets (23:23-25), and on the day of Atonement ([Lev. 16](/lev#Lev.16)).

 On other occasions special sacrifices were offered, as at the consecration of Aaron ([Ex. 29](/exod#Exod.29)) and the dedication of the temple ([1 Kings 8:5](/1kgs#1Kgs.8.5), [62](/1kgs#1Kgs.8.62)-64).

 Free-will burnt offerings were also permitted ([Lev. 1:13](/lev#Lev.1.13)), and were offered at the accession of Solomon to the throne ([1 Chr. 29:21](/1chr#1Chr.29.21)), and at the reformation brought about by Hezekiah ([2 Chr. 29](/2chr#2Chr.29): 31-35).

Caesarea,1121,c-p6.7,Caesarea,"(Palestinae), a city on the shore of the Mediterranean, on the great road from Tyre to Egypt, about 70 miles northwest of Jerusalem, at the northern extremity of the plain of Sharon. It was built by Herod the Great (B.C. 10), who named it after Caesar Augustus, hence called Caesarea Sebaste (Gr. Sebastos = “Augustus”), on the site of an old town called “Strato’s Tower.” It was the capital of the Roman province of Judaea, the seat of the governors or procurators, and the headquarters of the Roman troops. It was the great Gentile city of Palestine, with a spacious artificial harbour. It was adorned with many buildings of great splendour, after the manner of the Roman cities of the West. Here Cornelius the centurion was converted through the instrumentality of Peter ([Acts 10:1](/acts#Acts.10.1), [24](/acts#Acts.10.24)), and thus for the first time the door of faith was opened to the Gentiles. Philip the evangelist resided here with his four daughters (21:8).

He was of the sect of the Sadducees ([Acts 5:17](/acts#Acts.5.17)), and was a member of the council when he gave his opinion that Jesus should be put to death “for the people, and that the whole nation perish not” ([John 11:50](/john#John.11.50)). In these words he unconsciously uttered a prophecy. “Like Saul, he was a prophet in spite of himself.” Caiaphas had no power to inflict the punishment of death, and therefore Jesus was sent to Pilate, the Roman governor, that he might duly pronounce the sentence against him ([Matt. 27:2](/matt#Matt.27.2); [John 18:28](/john#John.18.28)). At a later period his hostility to the gospel is still manifest ([Acts 4:6](/acts#Acts.4.6)).",0.0,person,caiaphas_532,caiaphas_532,

Cain 1,1125,c-p9.13,Cain,"The first-born son of Adam and Eve ([Gen. 4](/gen#Gen.4)). He became a tiller of the ground, as his brother Abel followed the pursuits of pastoral life. He was “a sullen, self-willed, haughty, vindictive man; wanting the religious element in his character, and defiant even in his attitude towards God.” It came to pass “in process of time” (marg. “at the end of days”), i.e., probably on the Sabbath, that the two brothers presented their offerings to the Lord. Abel’s offering was of the “firstlings of his flock and of the fat,” while Cain’s was “of the fruit of the ground.” Abel’s sacrifice was “more excellent” ([Heb. 11:4](/heb#Heb.11.4)) than Cain’s, and was accepted by God. On this account Cain was “very wroth,” and cherished feelings of murderous hatred against his brother, and was at length guilty of the desperate outrage of putting him to death ([1 John 3:12](/1john#1John.3.12)). For this crime he was expelled from Eden, and henceforth led the life of an exile, bearing upon him some mark which God had set upon him in answer to his own cry for mercy, so that thereby he might be protected from the wrath of his fellow-men; or it may be that God only gave him some sign to assure him that he would not be slain ([Gen. 4:15](/gen#Gen.4.15)). Doomed to be a wanderer and a fugitive in the earth, he went forth into the “land of Nod”, i.e., the land of “exile”, which is said to have been in the “east of Eden,” and there he built a city, the first we read of, and called it after his son’s name, Enoch. His descendants are enumerated to the sixth generation. They gradually degenerated in their moral and spiritual condition till they became wholly corrupt before God.

Such hard cakes were carried by the Gibeonites when they came to Joshua (9:5, 12). They described their bread as “mouldy;” but the Hebrew word nikuddim, here used, ought rather to be rendered “hard as biscuit.” It is rendered “cracknels” in [1 Kings 14:3](/1kgs#1Kgs.14.3). The ordinary bread, when kept for a few days, became dry and excessively hard. The Gibeonites pointed to this hardness of their bread as an evidence that they had come a long journey.

 We read also of honey-cakes ([Ex. 16:31](/exod#Exod.16.31)), “cakes of figs” ([1 Sam. 25:18](/1sam#1Sam.25.18)), “cake” as denoting a whole piece of bread ([1 Kings 17:12](/1kgs#1Kgs.17.12)), and “a [round] cake of barley bread” ([Judg. 7:13](/judg#Judg.7.13)).

He was one of those whom Moses sent to search the land in the second year after the Exodus. He was one of the family chiefs of the tribe of Judah.

All the people that had been numbered, from twenty years old and upward, perished in the wilderness except these two. The last notice we have of Caleb is when (being then eighty-five years of age) he came to Joshua at the camp at Gilgal, after the people had gained possession of the land, and reminded him of the promise Moses had made to him, by virtue of which he claimed a certain portion of the land of Kirjath-arba as his inheritance ([Josh. 14:6-15](/josh#Josh.14.6); [15:13-15](/josh#Josh.15.13); [21:10-12](/josh#Josh.21.10); [1 Sam. 25:2](/1sam#1Sam.25.2), [3](/1sam#1Sam.25.3); [30:14](/1sam#1Sam.30.14)).

Calf,1139,c-p23.5,Calf,"Calves were commonly made use of in sacrifices, and are therefore frequently mentioned in Scripture. The “fatted calf” was regarded as the choicest of animal food; it was frequently also offered as a special sacrifice ([1 Sam. 28:24](/1sam#1Sam.28.24); [Amos 6:4](/amos#Amos.6.4); [Luke 15:23](/luke#Luke.15.23)). The words used in [Jer. 34:18](/jer#Jer.34.18), [19](/jer#Jer.34.19), “cut the calf in twain,” allude to the custom of dividing a sacrifice into two parts, between which the parties ratifying a covenant passed ([Gen. 15:9](/gen#Gen.15.9), [10](/gen#Gen.15.10), [17](/gen#Gen.15.17), [18](/gen#Gen.15.18)).

 The golden calf which Aaron made ([Ex. 32:4](/exod#Exod.32.4)) was probably a copy of the god Moloch rather than of the god Apis, the sacred ox or calf of Egypt. The Jews showed all through their history a tendency toward the Babylonian and Canaanitish idolatry rather than toward that of Egypt.

 Ages after this, Jeroboam, king of Israel, set up two idol calves, one at Dan, and the other at Bethel, that he might thus prevent the ten tribes from resorting to Jerusalem for worship ([1 Kings 12:28](/1kgs#1Kgs.12.28)). These calves continued to be a snare to the people till the time of their captivity. The calf at Dan was carried away in the reign of Pekah by Tiglath-pileser, and that at Bethel ten years later, in the reign of Hoshea, by Shalmaneser ([2 Kings 15:29](/2kgs#2Kgs.15.29); [17:33](/2kgs#2Kgs.17.33)).

 The camel was early used both for riding and as a beast of burden ([Gen. 24:64](/gen#Gen.24.64); [37:25](/gen#Gen.37.25)), and in war ([1 Sam. 30:17](/1sam#1Sam.30.17); [Isa. 21:7](/isa#Isa.21.7)).

Its flesh was not to be eaten, as it was ranked among unclean animals ([Lev. 11:4](/lev#Lev.11.4); [Deut. 14:7](/deut#Deut.14.7)). Abraham’s servant rode on a camel when he went to fetch a wife for Isaac ([Gen. 24:10](/gen#Gen.24.10), [11](/gen#Gen.24.11)). Jacob had camels as a portion of his wealth (30:43), as Abraham also had (24:35). He sent a present of thirty milch camels to his brother Esau (32:15). It appears to have been little in use among the Jews after the conquest. It is, however, mentioned in the history of David ([1 Chr. 27:30](/1chr#1Chr.27.30)), and after the Exile ([Ezra 2:67](/ezra#Ezra.2.67); [Neh. 7:69](/neh#Neh.7.69)). Camels were much in use among other nations in the East. The queen of Sheba came with a caravan of camels when she came to see the wisdom of Solomon ([1 Kings 10:2](/1kgs#1Kgs.10.2); [2 Chr. 9:1](/2chr#2Chr.9.1)). Benhadad of Damascus also sent a present to Elisha, “forty camels’ burden” ([2 Kings 8:9](/2kgs#2Kgs.8.9)).

 To show the difficulty in the way of a rich man’s entering into the kingdom, our Lord uses the proverbial expression that it was easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle ([Matt. 19:24](/matt#Matt.19.24)).

 To strain at (rather, out) a gnat and swallow a camel was also a proverbial expression ([Matt. 23:24](/matt#Matt.23.24)), used with reference to those who were careful to avoid small faults, and yet did not hesitate to commit the greatest sins. The Jews carefully filtered their wine before drinking it, for fear of swallowing along with it some insect forbidden in the law as unclean, and yet they omitted openly the “weightier matters” of the law.

 The raiment worn by John the Baptist was made of camel’s hair ([Matt. 3:4](/matt#Matt.3.4); [Mark 1:6](/mark#Mark.1.6)), by which he was distinguished from those who resided in royal palaces and wore soft raiment. This was also the case with Elijah ([2 Kings 1:8](/2kgs#2Kgs.1.8)), who is called “a hairy man,” from his wearing such raiment. “This is one of the most admirable materials for clothing; it keeps out the heat, cold, and rain.” The “sackcloth” so often alluded to ([2 Kings 1:8](/2kgs#2Kgs.1.8); [Isa. 15:3](/isa#Isa.15.3); [Zech. 13:4](/zech#Zech.13.4), etc.) was probably made of camel’s hair.",2.0,unmatched,unmatched,,

Canaan 2,1156,c-p46.4,Canaan,"The country which derived its name from the preceding. The name as first used by the Phoenicians denoted only the maritime plain on which Sidon was built. But in the time of Moses and Joshua it denoted the whole country to the west of the Jordan and the Dead Sea ([Deut. 11:30](/deut#Deut.11.30)). In [Josh. 5:12](/josh#Josh.5.12) the LXX. read, “land of the Phoenicians,” instead of “land of Canaan.”

 The name signifies “the lowlands,” as distinguished from the land of Gilead on the east of Jordan, which was a mountainous district. The extent and boundaries of Canaan are fully set forth in different parts of Scripture ([Gen. 10:19](/gen#Gen.10.19); [17:8](/gen#Gen.17.8); [Num. 13:29](/num#Num.13.29); [34:8](/num#Num.34.8)).",2.0,multi,"['canaan_272', 'canaan_914']",,canaan_272

Canaanites,1158,c-p50.5,Canaanites,"The descendants of Canaan, the son of Ham. Migrating from their original home, they seem to have reached the Persian Gulf, and to have there sojourned for some time. They thence “spread to the west, across the mountain chain of Lebanon to the very edge of the Mediterranean Sea, occupying all the land which later became Palestine, also to the north-west as far as the mountain chain of Taurus. This group was very numerous, and broken up into a great many peoples, as we can judge from the list of nations ([Gen. 10](/gen#Gen.10)), the ‘sons of Canaan.’” Six different tribes are mentioned in [Ex. 3:8](/exod#Exod.3.8), [17](/exod#Exod.3.17); 23:23; 33:2; 34:11. In [Ex. 13:5](/exod#Exod.13.5) the “Perizzites” are omitted. The “Girgashites” are mentioned in addition to the foregoing in [Deut. 7:1](/deut#Deut.7.1); [Josh. 3:10](/josh#Josh.3.10).

 The “Canaanites,” as distinguished from the Amalekites, the Anakim, and the Rephaim, were “dwellers in the lowlands” ([Num. 13:29](/num#Num.13.29)), the great plains and valleys, the richest and most important parts of Palestine. Tyre and Sidon, their famous cities, were the centres of great commercial activity; and hence the name “Canaanite” came to signify a “trader” or “merchant” ([Job 41:6](/job#Job.41.6); [Prov. 31:24](/prov#Prov.31.24), lit. “Canaanites;” comp. [Zeph. 1:11](/zeph#Zeph.1.11); [Ezek. 17:4](/ezek#Ezek.17.4)). The name “Canaanite” is also sometimes used to designate the non-Israelite inhabitants of the land in general ([Gen. 12:6](/gen#Gen.12.6); [Num. 21:3](/num#Num.21.3); [Judg. 1:10](/judg#Judg.1.10)).

 The Israelites, when they were led to the Promised Land, were commanded utterly to destroy the descendants of Canaan then possessing it ([Ex. 23:23](/exod#Exod.23.23); [Num. 33:52](/num#Num.33.52), [53](/num#Num.33.53); [Deut. 20:16](/deut#Deut.20.16), [17](/deut#Deut.20.17)). This was to be done “by little and little,” lest the beasts of the field should increase ([Ex. 23:29](/exod#Exod.23.29); [Deut. 7:22](/deut#Deut.7.22), [23](/deut#Deut.7.23)). The history of these wars of conquest is given in the Book of Joshua. The extermination of these tribes, however, was never fully carried out. Jerusalem was not taken till the time of David ([2 Sam. 5:6](/2sam#2Sam.5.6), [7](/2sam#2Sam.5.7)). In the days of Solomon bond-service was exacted from the fragments of the tribes still remaining in the land ([1 Kings 9:20](/1kgs#1Kgs.9.20), [21](/1kgs#1Kgs.9.21)). Even after the return from captivity survivors of five of the Canaanitish tribes were still found in the land.

 In the Tell-el-Amarna tablets Canaan is found under the forms of Kinakhna and Kinakhkhi. Under the name of Kanana the Canaanites appear on Egyptian monuments, wearing a coat of mail and helmet, and distinguished by the use of spear and javelin and the battle-axe. They were called Phoenicians by the Greeks and Poeni by the Romans. By race the Canaanites were Semitic. They were famous as merchants and seamen, as well as for their artistic skill. The chief object of their worship was the sun-god, who was addressed by the general name of Baal, “lord.” Each locality had its special Baal, and the various local Baals were summed up under the name of Baalim, “lords.”",0.0,person,canaan_914,,

This is seen from the fragments of the Phoenician language which still survive, which show the closest analogy to the Hebrew. Yet the subject of the language of the “Canaanites” is very obscure. The cuneiform writing of Babylon, as well as the Babylonian language, was taught in the Canaanitish schools, and the clay tablets of Babylonian literature were stored in the Canaanitish libraries.

Candace,1160,c-p55.2,Candace,"The queen of the Ethiopians whose “eunuch” or chamberlain was converted to Christianity by the instrumentality of Philip the evangelist ([Acts 8:27](/acts#Acts.8.27)).

It was long the centre of commercial intercourse between Africa and the south of Asia, and hence became famous for its wealth ([Isa. 45:14](/isa#Isa.45.14)).

 It is somewhat singular that female sovereignty seems to have prevailed in Ethiopia, the name Candace (compare “Pharaoh,” “Ptolemy,” “Caesar”) being a title common to several successive queens. It is probable that Judaism had taken root in Ethiopia at this time, and hence the visit of the queen’s treasurer to Jerusalem to keep the feast. There is a tradition that Candace was herself converted to Christianity by her treasurer on his return, and that he became the apostle of Christianity in that whole region, carrying it also into Abyssinia.

Candlestick,1162,c-p58.10,Candlestick,"The lamp-stand, “candelabrum,” which Moses was commanded to make for the tabernacle, according to the pattern shown him. Its form is described in [Ex. 25:31-40](/exod#Exod.25.31); [37:17-24](/exod#Exod.37.17), and may be seen represented on the Arch of Titus at Rome. It was among the spoils taken by the Romans from the temple of Jerusalem (A.D. 70). It was made of fine gold, and with the utensils belonging to it was a talent in weight.

 The tabernacle was a tent without windows, and thus artificial light was needed. This was supplied by the candlestick, which, however, served also as a symbol of the church or people of God, who are “the light of the world.” The light which “symbolizes the knowledge of God is not the sun or any natural light, but an artificial light supplied with a specially prepared oil; for the knowledge of God is in truth not natural nor common to all men, but furnished over and above nature.”

 This candlestick was placed on the south side of the Holy Place, opposite the table of shewbread ([Ex. 27:21](/exod#Exod.27.21); [30:7](/exod#Exod.30.7), [8](/exod#Exod.30.8); [Lev. 24:3](/lev#Lev.24.3); [1 Sam. 3:3](/1sam#1Sam.3.3)). It was lighted every evening, and was extinguished in the morning. In the morning the priests trimmed the seven lamps, borne by the seven branches, with golden snuffers, carrying away the ashes in golden dishes ([Ex. 25:38](/exod#Exod.25.38)), and supplying the lamps at the same time with fresh oil. What ultimately became of the candlestick is unknown.

 In Solomon’s temple there were ten separate candlesticks of pure gold, five on the right and five on the left of the Holy Place ([1 Kings 7:49](/1kgs#1Kgs.7.49); [2 Chr. 4:7](/2chr#2Chr.4.7)). Their structure is not mentioned. They were carried away to Babylon ([Jer. 52:19](/jer#Jer.52.19)).

 In the temple erected after the Exile there was again but one candlestick, and like the first, with seven branches. It was this which was afterwards carried away by Titus to Rome, where it was deposited in the Temple of Peace. When Genseric plundered Rome, he is said to have carried it to Carthage (A.D. 455).

Canon,1167,c-p67.3,Canon,"This word is derived from a Hebrew and Greek word denoting a reed or cane. Hence it means something straight, or something to keep straight; and hence also a rule, or something ruled or measured. It came to be applied to the Scriptures, to denote that they contained the authoritative rule of faith and practice, the standard of doctrine and duty. A book is said to be of canonical authority when it has a right to take a place with the other books which contain a revelation of the Divine will. Such a right does not arise from any ecclesiastical authority, but from the evidence of the inspired authorship of the book. The canonical (i.e., the inspired) books of the Old and New Testaments, are a complete rule, and the only rule, of faith and practice. They contain the whole supernatural revelation of God to men. The New Testament Canon was formed gradually under divine guidance. The different books as they were written came into the possession of the Christian associations which began to be formed soon after the day of Pentecost; and thus slowly the canon increased till all the books were gathered together into one collection containing the whole of the twenty-seven New Testament inspired books. Historical evidence shows that from about the middle of the second century this New Testament collection was substantially such as we now possess. Each book contained in it is proved to have, on its own ground, a right to its place; and thus the whole is of divine authority.

 The Old Testament Canon is witnessed to by the New Testament writers. Their evidence is conclusive. The quotations in the New from the Old are very numerous, and the references are much more numerous. These quotations and references by our Lord and the apostles most clearly imply the existence at that time of a well-known and publicly acknowledged collection of Hebrew writings under the designation of “The Scriptures;” “The Law and the Prophets and the Psalms;” “Moses and the Prophets,” etc. The appeals to these books, moreover, show that they were regarded as of divine authority, finally deciding all questions of which they treat; and that the whole collection so recognized consisted only of the thirty-nine books which we now posses. Thus they endorse as genuine and authentic the canon of the Jewish Scriptures. The Septuagint Version (q.v.) also contained every book we now have in the Old Testament Scriptures. As to the time at which the Old Testament canon was closed, there are many considerations which point to that of Ezra and Nehemiah, immediately after the return from Babylonian exile.

Capernaum,1168,c-p69.4,Capernaum,"Nahum’s town, a Galilean city frequently mentioned in the history of our Lord. It is not mentioned in the Old Testament. After our Lord’s expulsion from Nazareth ([Matt. 4:13-16](/matt#Matt.4.13); [Luke 4:16-31](/luke#Luke.4.16)), Capernaum became his “own city.” It was the scene of many acts and incidents of his life ([Matt. 8:5](/matt#Matt.8.5), [14](/matt#Matt.8.14), [15](/matt#Matt.8.15); 9:2-6, 10-17; 15:1-20; [Mark 1:32-34](/mark#Mark.1.32), etc.). The impenitence and unbelief of its inhabitants after the many evidences our Lord gave among them of the truth of his mission, brought down upon them a heavy denunciation of judgement ([Matt. 11:23](/matt#Matt.11.23)).

 It stood on the western shore of the Sea of Galilee. The “land of Gennesaret,” near, if not in, which it was situated, was one of the most prosperous and crowded districts of Palestine. This city lay on the great highway from Damascus to Acco and Tyre. It has been identified with Tell Hum, about two miles south-west of where the Jordan flows into the lake. Here are extensive ruins of walls and foundations, and also the remains of what must have been a beautiful synagogue, which it is conjectured may have been the one built by the centurion ([Luke 7:5](/luke#Luke.7.5)), in which our Lord frequently taught ([John 6:59](/john#John.6.59); [Mark 1:21](/mark#Mark.1.21); [Luke 4:33](/luke#Luke.4.33)). Others have conjectured that the ruins of the city are to be found at Khan Minyeh, some three miles further to the south on the shore of the lake. “If Tell Hum be Capernaum, the remains spoken of are without doubt the ruins of the synagogue built by the Roman centurion, and one of the most sacred places on earth. It was in this building that our Lord gave the well-known discourse in [John 6](/john#John.6); and it was not without a certain strange feeling that on turning over a large block we found the pot of manna engraved on its face, and remembered the words, ‘I am that bread of life: your fathers did eat manna in the wilderness, and are dead.’”, (The Recovery of Jerusalem.)",0.0,place,capernaum_274,,capernaum_274

Subsequently Shalmaneser invaded Israel and laid siege to Samaria, the capital of the kingdom. During the siege he died, and was succeeded by Sargon, who took the city, and transported the great mass of the people into Assyria (B.C. 721), placing them in Halah and in Habor, and in the cities of the Medes ([2 Kings 17:3](/2kgs#2Kgs.17.3), [5](/2kgs#2Kgs.17.5)).

The families thus removed were carried to distant cities, many of them not far from the Caspian Sea, and their place was supplied by colonists from Babylon and Cuthah, etc. ([2 Kings 17:24](/2kgs#2Kgs.17.24)).

 Many speculations have been indulged in with reference to these ten tribes. But we believe that all, except the number that probably allied themselves with Judah and shared in their restoration under Cyrus, are finally lost.

Captivity 2,1180,c-p80.23,Captivity,"Of Judah. In the third year of Jehoiachim, the eighteenth king of Judah (B.C. 605), Nebuchadnezzar having overcome the Egyptians at Carchemish, advanced to Jerusalem with a great army. After a brief siege he took that city, and carried away the vessels of the sanctuary to Babylon, and dedicated them in the Temple of Belus ([2 Kings 24:1](/2kgs#2Kgs.24.1); [2 Chr. 36:6](/2chr#2Chr.36.6), [7](/2chr#2Chr.36.7); [Dan. 1:1](/dan#Dan.1.1), [2](/dan#Dan.1.2)). He also carried away the treasures of the king, whom he made his vassal. At this time, from which is dated the “seventy years” of captivity ([Jer. 25](/jer#Jer.25); [Dan. 9:1](/dan#Dan.9.1), [2](/dan#Dan.9.2)), Daniel and his companions were carried to Babylon, there to be brought up at the court and trained in all the learning of the Chaldeans. After this, in the fifth year of Jehoiakim, a great national fast was appointed ([Jer. 36:9](/jer#Jer.36.9)), during which the king, to show his defiance, cut up the leaves of the book of Jeremiah’s prophecies as they were read to him in his winter palace, and threw them into the fire. In the same spirit he rebelled against Nebuchadnezzar ([2 Kings 24:1](/2kgs#2Kgs.24.1)), who again a second time (B.C. 598) marched against Jerusalem, and put Jehoiachim to death, placing his son Jehoiachin on the throne in his stead. But Jehoiachin’s counsellors displeasing Nebuchadnezzar, he again a third time turned his army against Jerusalem, and carried away to Babylon a second detachment of Jews as captives, to the number of 10,000 ([2 Kings 24:13](/2kgs#2Kgs.24.13); [Jer. 24:1](/jer#Jer.24.1); [2 Chr. 36:10](/2chr#2Chr.36.10)), among whom were the king, with his mother and all his princes and officers, also Ezekiel, who with many of his companions were settled on the banks of the river Chebar (q.v.). He also carried away all the remaining treasures of the temple and the palace, and the golden vessels of the sanctuary.

 Mattaniah, the uncle of Jehoiachin, was now made king over what remained of the kingdom of Judah, under the name of Zedekiah ([2 Kings 24:17](/2kgs#2Kgs.24.17); [2 Chr. 36:10](/2chr#2Chr.36.10)). After a troubled reign of eleven years his kingdom came to an end ([2 Chr. 36:11](/2chr#2Chr.36.11)). Nebuchadnezzar, with a powerful army, besieged Jerusalem, and Zedekiah became a prisoner in Babylon. His eyes were put out, and he was kept in close confinement till his death ([2 Kings 25:7](/2kgs#2Kgs.25.7)). The city was spoiled of all that was of value, and then given up to the flames. The temple and palaces were consumed, and the walls of the city were levelled with the ground (B.C. 586), and all that remained of the people, except a number of the poorest class who were left to till the ground and dress the vineyards, were carried away captives to Babylon. This was the third and last deportation of Jewish captives. The land was now utterly desolate, and was abondoned to anarchy.

 In the first year of his reign as king of Babylon (B.C. 536), Cyrus issued a decree liberating the Jewish captives, and permitting them to return to Jerusalem and rebuild the city and the temple ([2 Chr. 36:22](/2chr#2Chr.36.22), [23](/2chr#2Chr.36.23); [Ezra 1](/ezra#Ezra.1); [2](/ezra#Ezra.2)). The number of the people forming the first caravan, under Zerubbabel, amounted in all to 42,360 ([Ezra 2:64](/ezra#Ezra.2.64), [65](/ezra#Ezra.2.65)), besides 7,337 men-servants and maid-servants. A considerable number, 12,000 probably, from the ten tribes who had been carried away into Assyria no doubt combined with this band of liberated captives.

 At a later period other bands of the Jews returned (1) under Ezra (7:7) (B.C. 458), and (2) Nehemiah (7:66) (B.C. 445). But the great mass of the people remained still in the land to which they had been carried, and became a portion of the Jews of the “dispersion” ([John 7:35](/john#John.7.35); [1 Pet. 1:1](/1pet#1Pet.1.1)).

At the east end, in its highest part, it is 1,728 feet high, and at the west end it forms a promontory to the bay of Acre about 600 feet above the sea. It lay within the tribe of Asher. It was here, at the east end of the ridge, at a place called el-Mukhrakah (i.e., the place of burning), that Elijah brought back the people to their allegiance to God, and slew the prophets of Baal ([1 Kings 18](/1kgs#1Kgs.18)). Here were consumed the “fifties” of the royal guard; and here also Elisha received the visit of the bereaved mother whose son was restored by him to life ([2 Kings 4:25-37](/2kgs#2Kgs.4.25)). “No mountain in or around Palestine retains its ancient beauty so much as Carmel. Two or three villages and some scattered cottages are found on it; its groves are few but luxuriant; it is no place for crags and precipices or rocks of wild goats; but its surface is covered with a rich and constant verdure.” “The whole mountain-side is dressed with blossom, and flowering shrubs, and fragrant herbs.” The western extremity of the ridge is, however, more rocky and bleak than the eastern. The head of the bride in [Cant. 7:5](/song#Song.7.5) is compared to Carmel.

The districts most famous for their flocks of sheep were the plain of Sharon ([Isa. 65](/isa#Isa.65): 10), Mount Carmel ([Micah 7:14](/mic#Mic.7.14)), Bashan and Gilead ([Micah 7:14](/mic#Mic.7.14)).

The keepers so familiarized their sheep with their voices that they knew them, and followed them at their call. Sheep, but more especially rams and lambs, were frequently offered in sacrifice. The shearing of sheep was a great festive occasion ([1 Sam. 25:4](/1sam#1Sam.25.4); [2 Sam. 13:23](/2sam#2Sam.13.23)). They were folded at night, and guarded by their keepers against the attacks of the lion ([Micah 5:8](/mic#Mic.5.8)), the bear ([1 Sam. 17:34](/1sam#1Sam.17.34)), and the wolf ([Matt. 10:16](/matt#Matt.10.16); [John 10:12](/john#John.10.12)).

 The cave of Engedi (q.v.), now called ‘Ain Jidy, i.e., the “Fountain of the Kid”, where David cut off the skirt of Saul’s robe (24:4). Here he also found a shelter for himself and his followers to the number of 600 (23:29; 24:1). “On all sides the country is full of caverns which might serve as lurking-places for David and his men, as they do for outlaws at the present day.”

 The cave in which Obadiah hid the prophets ([1 Kings 18:4](/1kgs#1Kgs.18.4)) was probably in the north, but it cannot be identified.

 It grew very abundantly in Palestine, and particularly on Lebanon, of which it was “the glory” ([Isa. 35:2](/isa#Isa.35.2); [60:13](/isa#Isa.60.13)). Hiram supplied Solomon with cedar trees from Lebanon for various purposes connected with the construction of the temple and the king’s palace ([2 Sam. 5:11](/2sam#2Sam.5.11); [7:2](/2sam#2Sam.7.2), [7](/2sam#2Sam.7.7); [1 Kings 5:6](/1kgs#1Kgs.5.6), [8](/1kgs#1Kgs.5.8), [10](/1kgs#1Kgs.5.10); 6:9, 10, 15, 16, 18, 20; 7:2, 3, 7, 11, 12; 9:11, etc.). Cedars were used also in the building of the second temple under Zerubbabel ([Ezra 3:7](/ezra#Ezra.3.7)).

 Of the ancient cedars of Lebanon there remain now only some seven or eight. They are not standing together. But beside them there are found between three hundred and four hundred of younger growth. They stand in an amphitheatre fronting the west, about 6,400 feet above the level of the sea.

 The cedar is often figuratively alluded to in the sacred Scriptures. “The mighty conquerors of olden days, the despots of Assyria and the Pharaohs of Egypt, the proud and idolatrous monarchs of Judah, the Hebrew commonwealth itself, the war-like Ammonites of patriarchal times, and the moral majesty of the Messianic age, are all compared to the towering cedar, in its royal loftiness and supremacy ([Isa. 2:13](/isa#Isa.2.13); [Ezek. 17:3](/ezek#Ezek.17.3), [22](/ezek#Ezek.17.22), [23](/ezek#Ezek.17.23), [31](/ezek#Ezek.17.31):3-9; [Amos 2:9](/amos#Amos.2.9); [Zech. 11:1](/zech#Zech.11.1), [2](/zech#Zech.11.2); [Job 40:17](/job#Job.40.17); [Ps. 29:5](/ps#Ps.29.5); [80:10](/ps#Ps.80.10); [92:12](/ps#Ps.92.12), etc).”, Groser’s Scrip.

The censers in daily use were of brass ([Num. 16:39](/num#Num.16.39)), and were designated by a different Hebrew name, miktereth ([2 Chr. 26:19](/2chr#2Chr.26.19); [Ezek. 8:11](/ezek#Ezek.8.11)): while those used on the day of Atonement were of gold, and were denoted by a word (mahtah) meaning “something to take fire with;” LXX. pureion = a fire-pan.

Paul speaks of the golden censer as belonging to the tabernacle ([Heb. 9:4](/heb#Heb.9.4)).

 The country so named is a vast plain formed by the deposits of the Euphrates and the Tigris, extending to about 400 miles along the course of these rivers, and about 100 miles in average breadth. “In former days the vast plains of Babylon were nourished by a complicated system of canals and water-courses, which spread over the surface of the country like a network. The wants of a teeming population were supplied by a rich soil, not less bountiful than that on the banks of the Egyptian Nile. Like islands rising from a golden sea of waving corn stood frequent groves of palm-trees and pleasant gardens, affording to the idler or traveller their grateful and highly-valued shade. Crowds of passengers hurried along the dusty roads to and from the busy city. The land was rich in corn and wine.”

 Recent discoveries, more especially in Babylonia, have thrown much light on the history of the Hebrew patriarchs, and have illustrated or confirmed the Biblical narrative in many points. The ancestor of the Hebrew people, Abram, was, we are told, born at “Ur of the Chaldees.” “Chaldees” is a mistranslation of the Hebrew Kasdim, Kasdim being the Old Testament name of the Babylonians, while the Chaldees were a tribe who lived on the shores of the Persian Gulf, and did not become a part of the Babylonian population till the time of Hezekiah. Ur was one of the oldest and most famous of the Babylonian cities. Its site is now called Mugheir, or Mugayyar, on the western bank of the Euphrates, in Southern Babylonia. About a century before the birth of Abram it was ruled by a powerful dynasty of kings. Their conquests extended to Elam on the one side, and to the Lebanon on the other. They were followed by a dynasty of princes whose capital was Babylon, and who seem to have been of South Arabian origin. The founder of the dynasty was Sumu-abi (“Shem is my father”). But soon afterwards Babylonia fell under Elamite dominion. The kings of Babylon were compelled to acknowledge the supremacy of Elam, and a rival kingdom to that of Babylon, and governed by Elamites, sprang up at Larsa, not far from Ur, but on the opposite bank of the river. In the time of Abram the king of Larsa was Eri-Aku, the son of an Elamite prince, and Eri-Aku, as has long been recognized, is the Biblical “Arioch king of Ellasar” ([Gen. 14:1](/gen#Gen.14.1)).

Chance,1244,c-p159.3,Chance,"([Luke 10:31](/luke#Luke.10.31)). “It was not by chance that the priest came down by that road at that time, but by a specific arrangement and in exact fulfilment of a plan; not the plan of the priest, nor the plan of the wounded traveller, but the plan of God. By coincidence (Gr. sungkuria) the priest came down, that is, by the conjunction of two things, in fact, which were previously constituted a pair in the providence of God. In the result they fell together according to the omniscient Designer’s plan. This is the true theory of the divine government.” Compare the meeting of Philip with the Ethiopian ([Acts 8:26](/acts#Acts.8.26), [27](/acts#Acts.8.27)).

Chapter,1255,c-p166.9,Chapter,"The several books of the Old and New Testaments were from an early time divided into chapters. The Pentateuch was divided by the ancient Hebrews into 54 parshioth or sections, one of which was read in the synagogue every Sabbath day ([Acts. 13:15](/acts#Acts.13.15)). These sections were afterwards divided into 669 sidrim or orders of unequal length. The Prophets were divided in somewhat the same manner into haphtaroth or passages.

 In the early Latin and Greek versions of the Bible, similar divisions of the several books were made. The New Testament books were also divided into portions of various lengths under different names, such as titles and heads or chapters.

 In modern times this ancient example was imitated, and many attempts of the kind were made before the existing division into chapters was fixed. The Latin Bible published by Cardinal Hugo of St. Cher in A.D. 1240 is generally regarded as the first Bible that was divided into our present chapters, although it appears that some of the chapters were fixed as early as A.D. 1059.

Chariot,1258,c-p171.7,Chariot,"A vehicle generally used for warlike purposes. Sometimes, though but rarely, it is spoken of as used for peaceful purposes.

 The first mention of the chariot is when Joseph, as a mark of distinction, was placed in Pharaoh’s second state chariot ([Gen. 41:43](/gen#Gen.41.43)); and the next, when he went out in his own chariot to meet his father Jacob (46:29). Chariots formed part of the funeral procession of Jacob (50:9). When Pharaoh pursued the Israelites he took 600 war-chariots with him ([Ex. 14:7](/exod#Exod.14.7)). The Canaanites in the valleys of Palestine had chariots of iron ([Josh. 17:18](/josh#Josh.17.18); [Judg. 1:19](/judg#Judg.1.19)). Jabin, the king of Canaan, had 900 chariots ([Judg. 4:3](/judg#Judg.4.3)); and in Saul’s time the Philistines had 30,000. In his wars with the king of Zobah and with the Syrians, David took many chariots among the spoils ([2 Sam. 8:4](/2sam#2Sam.8.4); [10:18](/2sam#2Sam.10.18)). Solomon maintained as part of his army 1,400 chariots ([1 Kings 10:26](/1kgs#1Kgs.10.26)), which were chiefly imported from Egypt (29). From this time forward they formed part of the armies of Israel ([1 Kings 22:34](/1kgs#1Kgs.22.34); [2 Kings 9:16](/2kgs#2Kgs.9.16), [21](/2kgs#2Kgs.9.21); 13:7, 14; 18:24; 23:30).

 In the New Testament we have only one historical reference to the use of chariots, in the case of the Ethiopian eunuch ([Acts. 8:28](/acts#Acts.8.28), [29](/acts#Acts.8.29), [38](/acts#Acts.8.38)).

 This word is sometimes used figuratively for hosts ([Ps. 68:17](/ps#Ps.68.17); [2 Kings 6:17](/2kgs#2Kgs.6.17)). Elijah, by his prayers and his counsel, was “the chariot of Israel, and the horsemen thereof.” The rapid agency of God in the phenomena of nature is also spoken of under the similitude of a chariot ([Ps. 104:3](/ps#Ps.104.3); [Isa. 66:15](/isa#Isa.66.15); [Hab. 3:8](/hab#Hab.3.8)).

 Chariot of the cherubim ([1 Chr. 28:18](/1chr#1Chr.28.18)), the chariot formed by the two cherubs on the mercy-seat on which the Lord rides.

 Chariot cities were set apart for storing the war-chariots in time of peace ([2 Chr. 1:14](/2chr#2Chr.1.14)).

 Chariot horses were such as were peculiarly fitted for service in chariots ([2 Kings 7:14](/2kgs#2Kgs.7.14)).

 Chariots of war are described in [Ex. 14:7](/exod#Exod.14.7); [1 Sam. 13:5](/1sam#1Sam.13.5); [2 Sam. 8:4](/2sam#2Sam.8.4); [1 Chr. 18:4](/1chr#1Chr.18.4); [Josh. 11:4](/josh#Josh.11.4); [Judg. 4:3](/judg#Judg.4.3), [13](/judg#Judg.4.13). They were not used by the Israelites till the time of David. Elijah was translated in a “chariot of fire” ([2 Kings 2:11](/2kgs#2Kgs.2.11)). Comp. [2 Kings 6:17](/2kgs#2Kgs.6.17).

It was an early and universal opinion that the most venomous reptiles could be made harmless by certain charms or by sweet sounds. It is well known that there are jugglers in India and in other Eastern lands who practise this art at the present day.

 In [Isa. 19:3](/isa#Isa.19.3) the word “charmers” is the rendering of the Hebrew ’ittim, meaning, properly, necromancers (R.V. marg., “whisperers”). In [Deut. 18:11](/deut#Deut.18.11) the word “charmer” means a dealer in spells, especially one who, by binding certain knots, was supposed thereby to bind a curse or a blessing on its object.

Chedorlaomer,1263,c-p184.9,Chedorlaomer,"(= Khudur-Lagamar of the inscriptions), king of Elam. Many centuries before the age of Abraham, Canaan and even the Sinaitic peninsula had been conquered by Babylonian kings, and in the time of Abraham himself Babylonia was ruled by a dynasty which claimed sovereignity over Syria and Palestine. The kings of the dynasty bore names which were not Babylonian, but at once South Arabic and Hebrew. The most famous king of the dynasty was Khammu-rabi, who united Babylonia under one rule, and made Babylon its capital. When he ascended the throne, the country was under the suzerainty of the Elamites, and was divided into two kingdoms, that of Babylon (the Biblical Shinar) and that of Larsa (the Biblical Ellasar). The king of Larsa was Eri-Aku (“the servant of the moon-god”), the son of an Elamite prince, Kudur-Mabug, who is entitled “the father of the land of the Amorites.” A recently discovered tablet enumerates among the enemies of Khammu-rabi, Kudur-Lagamar (“the servant of the goddess Lagamar”) or Chedorlaomer, Eri-Aku or Arioch, and Tudkhula or Tidal. Khammu-rabi, whose name is also read Ammi-rapaltu or Amraphel by some scholars, succeeded in overcoming Eri-Aku and driving the Elamites out of Babylonia. Assur-bani-pal, the last of the Assyrian conquerors, mentions in two inscriptions that he took Susa 1635 years after Kedor-nakhunta, king of Elam, had conquered Babylonia.

Travellers have described it as one of the wildest ravines of this wild region, and peculiarly fitted to afford a secure asylum to the persecuted. But if the prophet’s interview with Ahab was in Samaria, and he thence journeyed toward the east, it is probable that he crossed Jordan and found refuge in some of the ravines of Gilead. The “brook” is said to have been “before Jordan,” which probably means that it opened toward that river, into which it flowed.

Cherub,1278,c-p194.3,Cherub,"Plural cherubim, the name of certain symbolical figures frequently mentioned in Scripture. They are first mentioned in connection with the expulsion of our first parents from Eden ([Gen. 3:24](/gen#Gen.3.24)). There is no intimation given of their shape or form. They are next mentioned when Moses was commanded to provide furniture for the tabernacle ([Ex. 25:17-20](/exod#Exod.25.17); [26:1](/exod#Exod.26.1), [31](/exod#Exod.26.31)). God promised to commune with Moses “from between the cherubim” (25:22). This expression was afterwards used to denote the Divine abode and presence ([Num. 7:89](/num#Num.7.89); [1 Sam. 4:4](/1sam#1Sam.4.4); [Isa. 37:16](/isa#Isa.37.16); [Ps. 80:1](/ps#Ps.80.1); [99:1](/ps#Ps.99.1)). In Ezekiel’s vision (10:1-20) they appear as living creatures supporting the throne of God. From Ezekiel’s description of them (1;10; 41:18, 19), they appear to have been compound figures, unlike any real object in nature; artificial images possessing the features and properties of several animals. Two cherubim were placed on the mercy-seat of the ark; two of colossal size overshadowed it in Solomon’s temple. Ezekiel (1:4-14) speaks of four; and this number of “living creatures” is mentioned in [Rev. 4:6](/rev#Rev.4.6). Those on the ark are called the “cherubim of glory” ([Heb. 9:5](/heb#Heb.9.5)), i.e., of the Shechinah, or cloud of glory, for on them the visible glory of God rested. They were placed one at each end of the mercy-seat, with wings stretched upward, and their faces “toward each other and toward the mercy-seat.” They were anointed with holy oil, like the ark itself and the other sacred furniture.

 The cherubim were symbolical. They were intended to represent spiritual existences in immediate contact with Jehovah. Some have regarded them as symbolical of the chief ruling power by which God carries on his operations in providence ([Ps. 18:10](/ps#Ps.18.10)). Others interpret them as having reference to the redemption of men, and as symbolizing the great rulers or ministers of the church. Many other opinions have been held regarding them which need not be referred to here. On the whole, it seems to be most satisfactory to regard the interpretation of the symbol to be variable, as is the symbol itself.

 Their office was, (1) on the expulsion of our first parents from Eden, to prevent all access to the tree of life; and (2) to form the throne and chariot of Jehovah in his manifestation of himself on earth. He dwelleth between and sitteth on the cherubim ([1 Sam. 4:4](/1sam#1Sam.4.4); [Ps. 80:1](/ps#Ps.80.1); [Ezek. 1:26](/ezek#Ezek.1.26), [28](/ezek#Ezek.1.28)).",0.0,unmatched,unmatched,,cherub_287

Child,1290,c-p208.2,Child,"This word has considerable latitude of meaning in Scripture. Thus Joseph is called a child at the time when he was probably about sixteen years of age ([Gen. 37:3](/gen#Gen.37.3)); and Benjamin is so called when he was above thirty years (44:20). Solomon called himself a little child when he came to the kingdom ([1 Kings 3:7](/1kgs#1Kgs.3.7)).

 The descendants of a man, however remote, are called his children; as, “the children of Edom,” “the children of Moab,” “the children of Israel.”

 In the earliest times mothers did not wean their children till they were from thirty months to three years old; and the day on which they were weaned was kept as a festival day ([Gen. 21:8](/gen#Gen.21.8); [Ex. 2:7](/exod#Exod.2.7), [9](/exod#Exod.2.9); [1 Sam. 1:22-24](/1sam#1Sam.1.22); [Matt. 21:16](/matt#Matt.21.16)).

 Figuratively the name is used for those who are ignorant or narrow-minded ([Matt. 11:16](/matt#Matt.11.16); [Luke 7:32](/luke#Luke.7.32); [1 Cor. 13:11](/1cor#1Cor.13.11)). “When I was a child, I spake as a child.” “Brethren, be not children in understanding” ([1 Cor. 14:20](/1cor#1Cor.14.20)). “That we henceforth be no more children, tossed to and fro” ([Eph. 4:14](/eph#Eph.4.14)).

Christ,1305,c-p230.4,Christ,"Anointed, the Greek translation of the Hebrew word rendered “Messiah” (q.v.), the official title of our Lord, occurring five hundred and fourteen times in the New Testament. It denotes that he was anointed or consecrated to his great redemptive work as Prophet, Priest, and King of his people. He is Jesus the Christ ([Acts 17:3](/acts#Acts.17.3); [18:5](/acts#Acts.18.5); [Matt. 22:42](/matt#Matt.22.42)), the Anointed One. He is thus spoken of by Isaiah (61:1), and by Daniel (9:24-26), who styles him “Messiah the Prince.”

 The Messiah is the same person as “the seed of the woman” ([Gen. 3:15](/gen#Gen.3.15)), “the seed of Abraham” ([Gen. 22:18](/gen#Gen.22.18)), the “Prophet like unto Moses” ([Deut. 18:15](/deut#Deut.18.15)), “the priest after the order of Melchizedek” ([Ps. 110:4](/ps#Ps.110.4)), “the rod out of the stem of Jesse” ([Isa. 11:1](/isa#Isa.11.1), [10](/isa#Isa.11.10)), the “Immanuel,” the virgin’s son ([Isa. 7:14](/isa#Isa.7.14)), “the branch of Jehovah” ([Isa. 4:2](/isa#Isa.4.2)), and “the messenger of the covenant” ([Mal. 3:1](/mal#Mal.3.1)). This is he “of whom Moses in the law and the prophets did write.” The Old Testament Scripture is full of prophetic declarations regarding the Great Deliverer and the work he was to accomplish. Jesus the Christ is Jesus the Great Deliverer, the Anointed One, the Saviour of men. This name denotes that Jesus was divinely appointed, commissioned, and accredited as the Saviour of men ([Heb. 5:4](/heb#Heb.5.4); [Isa. 11:2-4](/isa#Isa.11.2); [49:6](/isa#Isa.49.6); [John 5:37](/john#John.5.37); [Acts 2:22](/acts#Acts.2.22)).

 To believe that “Jesus is the Christ” is to believe that he is the Anointed, the Messiah of the prophets, the Saviour sent of God, that he was, in a word, what he claimed to be. This is to believe the gospel, by the faith of which alone men can be brought unto God.

 The time of the composition of the Chronicles was, there is every ground to conclude, subsequent to the Babylonian Exile, probably between 450 and 435 B.C. The contents of this twofold book, both as to matter and form, correspond closely with this idea. The close of the book records the proclamation of Cyrus permitting the Jews to return to their own land, and this forms the opening passage of the Book of Ezra, which must be viewed as a continuation of the Chronicles. The peculiar form of the language, being Aramaean in its general character, harmonizes also with that of the books which were written after the Exile. The author was certainly contemporary with Zerubbabel, details of whose family history are given ([1 Chr. 3:19](/1chr#1Chr.3.19)).

 The time of the composition being determined, the question of the authorship may be more easily decided. According to Jewish tradition, which was universally received down to the middle of the seventeenth century, Ezra was regarded as the author of the Chronicles. There are many points of resemblance and of contact between the Chronicles and the Book of Ezra which seem to confirm this opinion. The conclusion of the one and the beginning of the other are almost identical in expression. In their spirit and characteristics they are the same, showing thus also an identity of authorship.

 In their general scope and design these books are not so much historical as didactic. The principal aim of the writer appears to be to present moral and religious truth. He does not give prominence to political occurences, as is done in Samuel and Kings, but to ecclesiastical institutions. “The genealogies, so uninteresting to most modern readers, were really an important part of the public records of the Hebrew state. They were the basis on which not only the land was distributed and held, but the public services of the temple were arranged and conducted, the Levites and their descendants alone, as is well known, being entitled and first fruits set apart for that purpose.” The “Chronicles” are an epitome of the sacred history from the days of Adam down to the return from Babylonian Exile, a period of about 3,500 years. The writer gathers up “the threads of the old national life broken by the Captivity.”

 The sources whence the chronicler compiled his work were public records, registers, and genealogical tables belonging to the Jews. These are referred to in the course of the book ([1 Chr. 27:24](/1chr#1Chr.27.24); [29:29](/1chr#1Chr.29.29); [2 Chr. 9:29](/2chr#2Chr.9.29); [12:15](/2chr#2Chr.12.15); [13:22](/2chr#2Chr.13.22); [20:34](/2chr#2Chr.20.34); [24:27](/2chr#2Chr.24.27); [26:22](/2chr#2Chr.26.22); [32:32](/2chr#2Chr.32.32); [33:18](/2chr#2Chr.33.18), [19](/2chr#2Chr.33.19); [27:7](/2chr#2Chr.27.7); [35:25](/2chr#2Chr.35.25)). There are in Chronicles, and the books of Samuel and Kings, forty parallels, often verbal, proving that the writer both knew and used these records ([1 Chr. 17:18](/1chr#1Chr.17.18); comp. [2 Sam. 7:18-20](/2sam#2Sam.7.18); [1 Chr. 19](/1chr#1Chr.19); comp. [2 Sam. 10](/2sam#2Sam.10), etc.).

 As compared with Samuel and Kings, the Book of Chronicles omits many particulars there recorded ([2 Sam. 6:20-23](/2sam#2Sam.6.20); [9](/2sam#2Sam.9); [11](/2sam#2Sam.11); 14-19, etc.), and includes many things peculiar to itself ([1 Chr. 12](/1chr#1Chr.12); [22](/1chr#1Chr.22); 23-26; 27; 28; 29, etc.). Twenty whole chapters, and twenty-four parts of chapters, are occupied with matter not found elsewhere. It also records many things in fuller detail, as (e.g.) the list of David’s heroes ([1 Chr. 12:1-37](/1chr#1Chr.12.1)), the removal of the ark from Kirjath-jearim to Mount Zion ([1 Chr. 13](/1chr#1Chr.13); [15:2-24](/1chr#1Chr.15.2); [16:4-43](/1chr#1Chr.16.4); comp. [2 Sam. 6](/2sam#2Sam.6)), Uzziah’s leprosy and its cause ([2 Chr. 26:16-21](/2chr#2Chr.26.16); comp. [2 Kings 15:5](/2kgs#2Kgs.15.5)), etc.

 It has also been observed that another peculiarity of the book is that it substitutes modern and more common expressions for those that had then become unusual or obsolete. This is seen particularly in the substitution of modern names of places, such as were in use in the writer’s day, for the old names; thus Gezer ([1 Chr. 20:4](/1chr#1Chr.20.4)) is used instead of Gob ([2 Sam. 21:18](/2sam#2Sam.21.18)), etc.

 The Books of Chronicles are ranked among the khethubim or hagiographa. They are alluded to, though not directly quoted, in the New Testament ([Heb. 5:4](/heb#Heb.5.4); [Matt. 12:42](/matt#Matt.12.42); [23:35](/matt#Matt.23.35); [Luke 1:5](/luke#Luke.1.5); [11:31](/luke#Luke.11.31), [51](/luke#Luke.11.51)).",4.0,unmatched,unmatched,,

Chronology,1315,c-p246.2,Chronology,"Is the arrangement of facts and events in the order of time. The writers of the Bible themselves do not adopt any standard era according to which they date events. Sometimes the years are reckoned, e.g., from the time of the Exodus ([Num. 1:1](/num#Num.1.1); [33:38](/num#Num.33.38); [1 Kings 6:1](/1kgs#1Kgs.6.1)), and sometimes from the accession of kings ([1 Kings 15:1](/1kgs#1Kgs.15.1), [9](/1kgs#1Kgs.15.9), [25](/1kgs#1Kgs.15.25), [33](/1kgs#1Kgs.15.33), etc.), and sometimes again from the return from Exile ([Ezra 3:8](/ezra#Ezra.3.8)).

 Hence in constructing a system of Biblecal chronology, the plan has been adopted of reckoning the years from the ages of the patriarchs before the birth of their first-born sons for the period from the Creation to Abraham. After this period other data are to be taken into account in determining the relative sequence of events.

 As to the patriarchal period, there are three principal systems of chronology: (1) that of the Hebrew text, (2) that of the Septuagint version, and (3) that of the Samaritan Pentateuch, as seen in the scheme on the opposite page.

 The Samaritan and the Septuagint have considerably modified the Hebrew chronology. This modification some regard as having been wilfully made, and to be rejected. The same system of variations is observed in the chronology of the period between the Flood and Abraham. Thus:

 |             Hebrew Septuigant Samaritan   | From the birth of   |  Arphaxad, 2 years   |  after the Flood, to   |  the birth of Terah.   220   1000    870   | From the birth of   |  Terah to the birth   |  of Abraham.       130    70     72

 The Septuagint fixes on seventy years as the age of Terah at the birth of Abraham, from [Gen. 11:26](/gen#Gen.11.26); but a comparison of [Gen. 11:32](/gen#Gen.11.32) and [Acts 7:4](/acts#Acts.7.4) with [Gen. 12:4](/gen#Gen.12.4) shows that when Terah died, at the age of two hundred and five years, Abraham was seventy-five years, and hence Terah must have been one hundred and thirty years when Abraham was born. Thus, including the two years from the Flood to the birth of Arphaxad, the period from the Flood to the birth of Abraham was three hundred and fifty-two years.

 The next period is from the birth of Abraham to the Exodus. This, according to the Hebrew, extends to five hundred and five years. The difficulty here is as to the four hundred and thirty years mentioned [Ex. 12:40](/exod#Exod.12.40), [41](/exod#Exod.12.41); [Gal. 3:17](/gal#Gal.3.17). These years are regarded by some as dating from the covenant with Abraham ([Gen. 15](/gen#Gen.15)), which was entered into soon after his sojourn in Egypt; others, with more probability, reckon these years from Jacob’s going down into Egypt.

 In modern times the systems of Biblical chronology that have been adopted are chiefly those of Ussher and Hales. The former follows the Hebrew, and the latter the Septuagint mainly. Archbishop Ussher’s (died 1656) system is called the short chronology. It is that given on the margin of the Authorized Version, but is really of no authority, and is quite uncertain.

 |             Ussher  Hales   |             B.C.   B.C.   | Creation         4004   5411   | Flood          2348   3155   | Abram leaves Haran    1921   2078   | [Exodus          1491](/exod#Exod.1491)   1648   | Destruction of the   |  Temple         588   586

 To show at a glance the different ideas of the date of the creation, it may be interesting to note the following: From Creation to 1894.

 In the New Testament it is the translation of the Greek word ecclesia, which is synonymous with the Hebrew kahal of the Old Testament, both words meaning simply an assembly, the character of which can only be known from the connection in which the word is found. There is no clear instance of its being used for a place of meeting or of worship, although in post-apostolic times it early received this meaning. Nor is this word ever used to denote the inhabitants of a country united in the same profession, as when we say the “Church of England,” the “Church of Scotland,” etc.

Church 5,1324,c-p260.4,Church,"The whole body of professing Christians throughout the world ([1 Cor. 15:9](/1cor#1Cor.15.9); [Gal. 1:13](/gal#Gal.1.13); [Matt. 16:18](/matt#Matt.16.18)) are the church of Christ.

 The church visible “consists of all those throughout the world that profess the true religion, together with their children.” It is called “visible” because its members are known and its assemblies are public. Here there is a mixture of “wheat and chaff,” of saints and sinners. “God has commanded his people to organize themselves into distinct visible ecclesiastical communities, with constitutions, laws, and officers, badges, ordinances, and discipline, for the great purpose of giving visibility to his kingdom, of making known the gospel of that kingdom, and of gathering in all its elect subjects. Each one of these distinct organized communities which is faithful to the great King is an integral part of the visible church, and all together constitute the catholic or universal visible church.” A credible profession of the true religion constitutes a person a member of this church. This is “the kingdom of heaven,” whose character and progress are set forth in the parables recorded in [Matt. 13](/matt#Matt.13).

 The children of all who thus profess the true religion are members of the visible church along with their parents. Children are included in every covenant God ever made with man. They go along with their parents ([Gen. 9:9-17](/gen#Gen.9.9); [12:1-3](/gen#Gen.12.1); [17:7](/gen#Gen.17.7); [Ex. 20:5](/exod#Exod.20.5); [Deut. 29:10-13](/deut#Deut.29.10)). Peter, on the day of Pentecost, at the beginning of the New Testament dispensation, announces the same great principle. “The promise [just as to Abraham and his seed the promises were made] is unto you, and to your children” ([Acts 2:38](/acts#Acts.2.38), [39](/acts#Acts.2.39)). The children of believing parents are “holy”, i.e., are “saints”, a title which designates the members of the Christian church ([1 Cor. 7:14](/1cor#1Cor.7.14)).

 The church invisible “consists of the whole number of the elect that have been, are, or shall be gathered into one under Christ, the head thereof.” This is a pure society, the church in which Christ dwells. It is the body of Christ. it is called “invisible” because the greater part of those who constitute it are already in heaven or are yet unborn, and also because its members still on earth cannot certainly be distinguished. The qualifications of membership in it are internal and are hidden. It is unseen except by Him who “searches the heart.” “The Lord knoweth them that are his” ([2 Tim. 2:19](/2tim#2Tim.2.19)).

It is mentioned among the countries which took part in the attack upon Egypt in the reign of Rameses III. (of the Twentieth Dynasty), but as its king is not one of the princes stated to have been conquered by the Pharaoh, it would seem that he did not actually enter Egypt. As the reign of Rameses III. corresponds with the Israelitish occupation of Canaan, it is probable that the Egyptian monuments refer to the oppression of the Israelites by Chushan-rishathaim.

Circumcision,1334,c-p280.4,Circumcision,"Cutting around. This rite, practised before, as some think, by divers races, was appointed by God to be the special badge of his chosen people, an abiding sign of their consecration to him. It was established as a national ordinance ([Gen. 17:10](/gen#Gen.17.10), [11](/gen#Gen.17.11)). In compliance with the divine command, Abraham, though ninety-nine years of age, was circumcised on the same day with Ishmael, who was thirteen years old (17:24-27). Slaves, whether home-born or purchased, were circumcised (17:12, 13); and all foreigners must have their males circumcised before they could enjoy the privileges of Jewish citizenship ([Ex. 12:48](/exod#Exod.12.48)). During the journey through the wilderness, the practice of circumcision fell into disuse, but was resumed by the command of Joshua before they entered the Promised Land ([Josh. 5:2-9](/josh#Josh.5.2)). It was observed always afterwards among the tribes of israel, although it is not expressly mentioned from the time of the settlement in Canaan till the time of Christ, about 1,450 years. The Jews prided themselves in the possession of this covenant distinction ([Judg. 14:3](/judg#Judg.14.3); [15:18](/judg#Judg.15.18); [1 Sam. 14:6](/1sam#1Sam.14.6); [17:26](/1sam#1Sam.17.26); [2 Sam. 1:20](/2sam#2Sam.1.20); [Ezek. 31:18](/ezek#Ezek.31.18)).

 As a rite of the church it ceased when the New Testament times began ([Gal. 6:15](/gal#Gal.6.15); [Col. 3:11](/col#Col.3.11)). Some Jewish Christians sought to impose it, however, on the Gentile converts; but this the apostles resolutely resisted ([Acts 15:1](/acts#Acts.15.1); [Gal. 6:12](/gal#Gal.6.12)). Our Lord was circumcised, for it “became him to fulfil all righteousness,” as of the seed of Abraham, according to the flesh; and Paul “took and circumcised” Timothy ([Acts 16:3](/acts#Acts.16.3)), to avoid giving offence to the Jews. It would render Timothy’s labours more acceptable to the Jews. But Paul would by no means consent to the demand that Titus should be circumcised ([Gal. 2:3-5](/gal#Gal.2.3)). The great point for which he contended was the free admission of uncircumcised Gentiles into the church. He contended successfully in behalf of Titus, even in Jerusalem.

 In the Old Testament a spiritual idea is attached to circumcision. It was the symbol of purity ([Isa. 52:1](/isa#Isa.52.1)). We read of uncircumcised lips ([Ex. 6:12](/exod#Exod.6.12), [30](/exod#Exod.6.30)), ears ([Jer. 6:10](/jer#Jer.6.10)), hearts ([Lev. 26:41](/lev#Lev.26.41)).

The covenant with Abraham was a dispensation or a specific form of the covenant of grace, and circumcision was a sign and seal of that covenant. It had a spiritual meaning. It signified purification of the heart, inward circumcision effected by the Spirit ([Deut. 10:16](/deut#Deut.10.16); [30:6](/deut#Deut.30.6); [Ezek. 44:7](/ezek#Ezek.44.7); [Acts 7:51](/acts#Acts.7.51); [Rom. 2:28](/rom#Rom.2.28); [Col. 2:11](/col#Col.2.11)). Circumcision as a symbol shadowing forth sanctification by the Holy Spirit has now given way to the symbol of baptism (q.v.). But the truth embodied in both ordinances is ever the same, the removal of sin, the sanctifying effects of grace in the heart.

 Under the Jewish dispensation, church and state were identical. No one could be a member of the one without also being a member of the other. Circumcision was a sign and seal of membership in both.

Cistern,1337,c-p285.1,Cistern,"The rendering of a Hebrew word bor, which means a receptacle for water conveyed to it; distinguished from beer, which denotes a place where water rises on the spot ([Jer. 2:13](/jer#Jer.2.13); [Prov. 5:15](/prov#Prov.5.15); [Isa. 36:16](/isa#Isa.36.16)), a fountain. Cisterns are frequently mentioned in Scripture. The scarcity of springs in Palestine made it necessary to collect rain-water in reservoirs and cisterns ([Num. 21:22](/num#Num.21.22)).

Under the Mosaic law non-Israelites, with the exception of the Moabites and the Ammonites and others mentioned in [Deut. 23:1-3](/deut#Deut.23.1), were admitted to the general privileges of citizenship among the Jews ([Ex. 12:19](/exod#Exod.12.19); [Lev. 24:22](/lev#Lev.24.22); [Num. 15:15](/num#Num.15.15); [35:15](/num#Num.35.15); [Deut. 10:18](/deut#Deut.10.18); [14:29](/deut#Deut.14.29); [16:10](/deut#Deut.16.10), [14](/deut#Deut.16.14)).

 The right of citizenship under the Roman government was granted by the emperor to individuals, and sometimes to provinces, as a favour or as a recompense for services rendered to the state, or for a sum of money ([Acts 22:28](/acts#Acts.22.28)). This “freedom” secured privileges equal to those enjoyed by natives of Rome. Among the most notable of these was the provision that a man could not be bound or imprisoned without a formal trial ([Acts 22:25](/acts#Acts.22.25), [26](/acts#Acts.22.26)), or scourged (16:37).

Next, we have a record of the cities of the Canaanites, Sidon, Gaza, Sodom, etc. (10:12, 19; 11:3, 9; 36:31-39). The earliest description of a city is that of Sodom (19:1-22). Damascus is said to be the oldest existing city in the world. Before the time of Abraham there were cities in Egypt ([Num. 13:22](/num#Num.13.22)). The Israelites in Egypt were employed in building the “treasure cities” of Pithom and Raamses ([Ex. 1:11](/exod#Exod.1.11)); but it does not seem that they had any cities of their own in Goshen ([Gen. 46:34](/gen#Gen.46.34); [47:1-11](/gen#Gen.47.1)). In the kingdom of Og in Bashan there were sixty “great cities with walls,” and twenty-three cities in Gilead partly rebuilt by the tribes on the east of Jordan ([Num. 21:21](/num#Num.21.21), [32](/num#Num.21.32), [33](/num#Num.21.33), [35](/num#Num.21.35); [32:1-3](/num#Num.32.1), [34-42](/num#Num.32.34); [Deut. 3:4](/deut#Deut.3.4), [5](/deut#Deut.3.5), [14](/deut#Deut.3.14); [1 Kings 4:13](/1kgs#1Kgs.4.13)). On the west of Jordan were thirty-one “royal cities” ([Josh. 12](/josh#Josh.12)), besides many others spoken of in the history of Israel.

 A fenced city was a city surrounded by fortifications and high walls, with watch-towers upon them ([2 Chr. 11:11](/2chr#2Chr.11.11); [Deut. 3:5](/deut#Deut.3.5)). There was also within the city generally a tower to which the citizens might flee when danger threatened them ([Judg. 9:46-52](/judg#Judg.9.46)).

 A city with suburbs was a city surrounded with open pasture-grounds, such as the forty-eight cities which were given to the Levites ([Num. 35:2-7](/num#Num.35.2)). There were six cities of refuge, three on each side of Jordan, namely, Kadesh, Shechem, Hebron, on the west of Jordan; and on the east, Bezer, Ramoth-gilead, and Golan. The cities on each side of the river were nearly opposite each other. The regulations concerning these cities are given in [Num. 35:9-34](/num#Num.35.9); [Deut. 19:1-13](/deut#Deut.19.1); [Ex. 21:12-14](/exod#Exod.21.12).

 When David reduced the fortress of the Jebusites which stood on Mount Zion, he built on the site of it a palace and a city, which he called by his own name ([1 Chr. 11:5](/1chr#1Chr.11.5)), the city of David. Bethlehem is also so called as being David’s native town ([Luke 2:4](/luke#Luke.2.4)).

Claudius 1,1343,c-p297.2,Claudius,"The fourth Roman emperor. He succeeded Caligula (A.D. 41). Though in general he treated the Jews, especially those in Asia and Egypt, with great indulgence, yet about the middle of his reign (A.D. 49) he banished them all from Rome ([Acts 18:2](/acts#Acts.18.2)). In this edict the Christians were included, as being, as was supposed, a sect of Jews. The Jews, however soon again returned to Rome.

 During the reign of this emperor, several persecutions of the Christians by the Jews took place in the dominions of Herod Agrippa, in one of which the apostle James was “killed” (12:2). He died A.D. 54.",1.0,person,claudius_947,claudius_947,

Clay was used for sealing ([Job 38:14](/job#Job.38.14); [Jer. 32:14](/jer#Jer.32.14)). Our Lord’s tomb may have been thus sealed ([Matt. 27:66](/matt#Matt.27.66)). The practice of sealing doors with clay is still common in the East. Clay was also in primitive times used for mortar ([Gen. 11:3](/gen#Gen.11.3)). The “clay ground” in which the large vessels of the temple were cast ([1 Kings 7:46](/1kgs#1Kgs.7.46); [2 Chr. 4:17](/2chr#2Chr.4.17)) was a compact loam fitted for the purpose.

Clean,1346,c-p301.14,Clean,"The various forms of uncleanness according to the Mosaic law are enumerated in [Lev. 11](/lev#Lev.11)-15; [Num. 19](/num#Num.19). The division of animals into clean and unclean was probably founded on the practice of sacrifice. It existed before the Flood ([Gen. 7:2](/gen#Gen.7.2)). The regulations regarding such animals are recorded in [Lev. 11](/lev#Lev.11) and [Deut. 14:1-21](/deut#Deut.14.1).

 The Hebrews were prohibited from using as food certain animal substances, such as (1) blood; (2) the fat covering the intestines, termed the caul; (3) the fat on the intestines, called the mesentery; (4) the fat of the kidneys; and (5) the fat tail of certain sheep ([Ex. 29:13](/exod#Exod.29.13), [22](/exod#Exod.29.22); [Lev. 3:4-9](/lev#Lev.3.4); [9:19](/lev#Lev.9.19); [17:10](/lev#Lev.17.10); [19:26](/lev#Lev.19.26)).

 The chief design of these regulations seems to have been to establish a system of regimen which would distinguish the Jews from all other nations. Regarding the design and the abolition of these regulations the reader will find all the details in [Lev. 20:24-26](/lev#Lev.20.24); [Acts 10:9-16](/acts#Acts.10.9); [11:1-10](/acts#Acts.11.1); [Heb. 9:9-14](/heb#Heb.9.9).",0.0,unmatched,unmatched,,

If “wife” is rightly inserted, then Mary was the mother of James the Less, and Clopas is the same as Alphaeus ([Matt. 10:3](/matt#Matt.10.3); [27:56](/matt#Matt.27.56)).",0.0,person,cleophas_950,,
Cloak,1350,c-p307.4,Cloak,"An upper garment, “an exterior tunic, wide and long, reaching to the ankles, but without sleeves” ([Isa. 59:17](/isa#Isa.59.17)). The word so rendered is elsewhere rendered “robe” or “mantle.” It was worn by the high priest under the ephod ([Ex. 28:31](/exod#Exod.28.31)), by kings and others of rank ([1 Sam. 15:27](/1sam#1Sam.15.27); [Job 1:20](/job#Job.1.20); [2:12](/job#Job.2.12)), and by women ([2 Sam. 13:18](/2sam#2Sam.13.18)).

 The word translated “cloke”, i.e., outer garment, in [Matt. 5:40](/matt#Matt.5.40) is in its plural form used of garments in general ([Matt. 17:2](/matt#Matt.17.2); [26:65](/matt#Matt.26.65)). The cloak mentioned here and in [Luke 6:29](/luke#Luke.6.29) was the Greek himation, Latin pallium, and consisted of a large square piece of wollen cloth fastened round the shoulders, like the abba of the Arabs. This could be taken by a creditor ([Ex. 22:26](/exod#Exod.22.26), [27](/exod#Exod.22.27)), but the coat or tunic (Gr. chiton) mentioned in [Matt. 5:40](/matt#Matt.5.40) could not.

 The cloak which Paul “left at Troas” ([2 Tim. 4:13](/2tim#2Tim.4.13)) was the Roman paenula, a thick upper garment used chiefly in travelling as a protection from the weather.

Cloud,1352,c-p311.4,Cloud,"The Hebrew so rendered means “a covering,” because clouds cover the sky.

A “cloud without rain” is a proverbial saying, denoting a man who does not keep his promise ([Prov. 16:15](/prov#Prov.16.15); [Isa. 18:4](/isa#Isa.18.4); [25:5](/isa#Isa.25.5); [Jude 1](/jude#Jude.1.1):12). A cloud is the figure of that which is transitory ([Job 30:15](/job#Job.30.15); [Hos. 6:4](/hos#Hos.6.4)). A bright cloud is the symbolical seat of the Divine presence ([Ex. 29:42](/exod#Exod.29.42), [43](/exod#Exod.29.43); [1 Kings 8:10](/1kgs#1Kgs.8.10); [2 Chr. 5:14](/2chr#2Chr.5.14); [Ezek. 43:4](/ezek#Ezek.43.4)), and was called the Shechinah (q.v.). Jehovah came down upon Sinai in a cloud ([Ex. 19:9](/exod#Exod.19.9)); and the cloud filled the court around the tabernacle in the wilderness so that Moses could not enter it ([Ex. 40:34](/exod#Exod.40.34), [35](/exod#Exod.40.35)). At the dedication of the temple also the cloud “filled the house of the Lord” ([1 Kings 8:10](/1kgs#1Kgs.8.10)). Thus in like manner when Christ comes the second time he is described as coming “in the clouds” ([Matt. 17:5](/matt#Matt.17.5); [24:30](/matt#Matt.24.30); [Acts 1:9](/acts#Acts.1.9), [11](/acts#Acts.1.11)). False teachers are likened unto clouds carried about with a tempest (2 Pet. 2:17). The infirmities of old age, which come one after another, are compared by Solomon to “clouds returning after the rain” ([Eccl. 12:2](/eccl#Eccl.12.2)). The blotting out of sins is like the sudden disappearance of threatening clouds from the sky ([Isa. 44:22](/isa#Isa.44.22)).

Coal,1354,c-p314.2,Coal,"It is by no means certain that the Hebrews were acquainted with mineral coal, although it is found in Syria. Their common fuel was dried dung of animals and wood charcoal. Two different words are found in Hebrew to denote coal, both occurring in [Prov. 26:21](/prov#Prov.26.21), “As coal [Heb. peham; i.e., “black coal”] is to burning coal [Heb. gehalim].” The latter of these words is used in [Job 41:21](/job#Job.41.21); [Prov. 6:28](/prov#Prov.6.28); [Isa. 44:19](/isa#Isa.44.19). The words “live coal” in [Isa. 6:6](/isa#Isa.6.6) are more correctly “glowing stone.” In [Lam. 4:8](/lam#Lam.4.8) the expression “blacker than a coal” is literally rendered in the margin of the Revised Version “darker than blackness.” “Coals of fire” ([2 Sam. 22:9](/2sam#2Sam.22.9), [13](/2sam#2Sam.22.13); [Ps. 18:8](/ps#Ps.18.8), [12](/ps#Ps.18.12), [13](/ps#Ps.18.13), etc.) is an expression used metaphorically for lightnings proceeding from God. A false tongue is compared to “coals of juniper” ([Ps. 120:4](/ps#Ps.120.4); [James 3:6](/jas#Jas.3.6)). “Heaping coals of fire on the head” symbolizes overcoming evil with good. The words of Paul ([Rom. 12:20](/rom#Rom.12.20)) are equivalent to saying, “By charity and kindness thou shalt soften down his enmity as surely as heaping coals on the fire fuses the metal in the crucible.”",0.0,unmatched,unmatched,,

Paul argues against such teaching, showing that in Christ Jesus they had all things. He sets forth the majesty of his redemption.

 This colour was an emblem of purity and innocence ([Mark 16:5](/mark#Mark.16.5); [John 20:12](/john#John.20.12); [Rev. 19:8](/rev#Rev.19.8), [14](/rev#Rev.19.14)), of joy ([Eccl. 9:8](/eccl#Eccl.9.8)), and also of victory ([Zech. 6:3](/zech#Zech.6.3); [Rev. 6:2](/rev#Rev.6.2)). The hangings of the tabernacle court ([Ex. 27:9](/exod#Exod.27.9); [38:9](/exod#Exod.38.9)), the coats, mitres, bonnets, and breeches of the priests ([Ex. 39:27](/exod#Exod.39.27), [28](/exod#Exod.39.28)), and the dress of the high priest on the day of Atonement ([Lev. 16:4](/lev#Lev.16.4), [32](/lev#Lev.16.32)), were white.

 Black, applied to the hair ([Lev. 13:31](/lev#Lev.13.31); [Cant. 5:11](/song#Song.5.11)), the complexion ([Cant. 1:5](/song#Song.1.5)), and to horses ([Zech. 6:2](/zech#Zech.6.2), [6](/zech#Zech.6.6)). The word rendered “brown” in [Gen. 30:32](/gen#Gen.30.32) (R.V., “black”) means properly “scorched”, i.e., the colour produced by the influence of the sun’s rays. “Black” in [Job 30:30](/job#Job.30.30) means dirty, blackened by sorrow and disease. The word is applied to a mourner’s robes ([Jer. 8:21](/jer#Jer.8.21); [14:2](/jer#Jer.14.2)), to a clouded sky ([1 Kings 18:45](/1kgs#1Kgs.18.45)), to night ([Micah 3:6](/mic#Mic.3.6); [Jer. 4:28](/jer#Jer.4.28)), and to a brook rendered turbid by melted snow ([Job 6:16](/job#Job.6.16)). It is used as symbolical of evil in [Zech. 6:2](/zech#Zech.6.2), [6](/zech#Zech.6.6) and [Rev. 6:5](/rev#Rev.6.5). It was the emblem of mourning, affliction, calamity ([Jer. 14:2](/jer#Jer.14.2); [Lam. 4:8](/lam#Lam.4.8); [5:10](/lam#Lam.5.10)).

 Red, applied to blood ([2 Kings 3](/2kgs#2Kgs.3);[22](/2kgs#2Kgs.22)), a heifer ([Num. 19:2](/num#Num.19.2)), pottage of lentils ([Gen. 25:30](/gen#Gen.25.30)), a horse ([Zech. 1:8](/zech#Zech.1.8)), wine ([Prov. 23:31](/prov#Prov.23.31)), the complexion ([Gen. 25:25](/gen#Gen.25.25); [Cant. 5:10](/song#Song.5.10)). This colour is symbolical of bloodshed ([Zech. 6:2](/zech#Zech.6.2); [Rev. 6:4](/rev#Rev.6.4); [12:3](/rev#Rev.12.3)).

 Purple, a colour obtained from the secretion of a species of shell-fish (the Murex trunculus) which was found in the Mediterranean, and particularly on the coasts of Phoenicia and Asia Minor. The colouring matter in each separate shell-fish amounted to only a single drop, and hence the great value of this dye. Robes of this colour were worn by kings ([Judg. 8:26](/judg#Judg.8.26)) and high officers ([Esther 8:15](/esth#Esth.8.15)). They were also worn by the wealthy and luxurious ([Jer. 10:9](/jer#Jer.10.9); [Ezek. 27:7](/ezek#Ezek.27.7); [Luke 16:19](/luke#Luke.16.19); [Rev. 17:4](/rev#Rev.17.4)). With this colour was associated the idea of royalty and majesty ([Judg. 8:26](/judg#Judg.8.26); [Cant. 3:10](/song#Song.3.10); [7:5](/song#Song.7.5); [Dan. 5:7](/dan#Dan.5.7), [16](/dan#Dan.5.16), [29](/dan#Dan.5.29)).

 Blue. This colour was also procured from a species of shell-fish, the chelzon of the Hebrews, and the Helix ianthina of modern naturalists. The tint was emblematic of the sky, the deep dark hue of the Eastern sky. This colour was used in the same way as purple. The ribbon and fringe of the Hebrew dress were of this colour ([Num. 15:38](/num#Num.15.38)). The loops of the curtains ([Ex. 26:4](/exod#Exod.26.4)), the lace of the high priest’s breastplate, the robe of the ephod, and the lace on his mitre, were blue ([Ex. 28:28](/exod#Exod.28.28), [31](/exod#Exod.28.31), [37](/exod#Exod.28.37)).

 Scarlet, or Crimson. In [Isa. 1:18](/isa#Isa.1.18) a Hebrew word is used which denotes the worm or grub whence this dye was procured. In [Gen. 38:28](/gen#Gen.38.28), [30](/gen#Gen.38.30), the word so rendered means “to shine,” and expresses the brilliancy of the colour. The small parasitic insects from which this dye was obtained somewhat resembled the cochineal which is found in Eastern countries. It is called by naturalists Coccus ilics. The dye was procured from the female grub alone. The only natural object to which this colour is applied in Scripture is the lips, which are likened to a scarlet thread ([Cant. 4:3](/song#Song.4.3)). Scarlet robes were worn by the rich and luxurious ([2 Sam. 1:24](/2sam#2Sam.1.24); [Prov. 31:21](/prov#Prov.31.21); [Jer. 4:30](/jer#Jer.4.30). [Rev. 17:4](/rev#Rev.17.4)). It was also the hue of the warrior’s dress ([Nah. 2:3](/nah#Nah.2.3); [Isa. 9:5](/isa#Isa.9.5)). The Phoenicians excelled in the art of dyeing this colour ([2 Chr. 2:7](/2chr#2Chr.2.7)).

 These four colours—white, purple, blue, and scarlet—were used in the textures of the tabernacle curtains ([Ex. 26:1](/exod#Exod.26.1), [31](/exod#Exod.26.31), [36](/exod#Exod.26.36)), and also in the high priest’s ephod, girdle, and breastplate ([Ex. 28:5](/exod#Exod.28.5), [6](/exod#Exod.28.6), [8](/exod#Exod.28.8), [15](/exod#Exod.28.15)). Scarlet thread is mentioned in connection with the rites of cleansing the leper ([Lev. 14:4](/lev#Lev.14.4), [6](/lev#Lev.14.6), [51](/lev#Lev.14.51)) and of burning the red heifer ([Num. 19:6](/num#Num.19.6)). It was a crimson thread that Rahab was to bind on her window as a sign that she was to be saved alive ([Josh. 2:18](/josh#Josh.2.18); [6:25](/josh#Josh.6.25)) when the city of Jericho was taken.

 Vermilion, the red sulphuret of mercury, or cinnabar; a colour used for drawing the figures of idols on the walls of temples ([Ezek. 23:14](/ezek#Ezek.23.14)), or for decorating the walls and beams of houses ([Jer. 22:14](/jer#Jer.22.14)).",0.0,unmatched,unmatched,,

The same Greek word thus rendered is translated “Advocate” in [1 John 2:1](/1john#1John.2.1) as applicable to Christ. It means properly “one who is summoned to the side of another” to help him in a court of justice by defending him, “one who is summoned to plead a cause.” “Advocate” is the proper rendering of the word in every case where it occurs.

 It is worthy of notice that although Paul nowhere uses the word paracletos, he yet presents the idea it embodies when he speaks of the “intercession” both of Christ and the Spirit ([Rom. 8:27](/rom#Rom.8.27), [34](/rom#Rom.8.34)).",0.0,unmatched,unmatched,,

"Commandments, the Ten",1376,c-p348.8,"Commandments, the Ten","([Ex. 34:28](/exod#Exod.34.28); [Deut. 10:4](/deut#Deut.10.4), marg. “ten words”) i.e., the Decalogue (q.v.), is a summary of the immutable moral law. These commandments were first given in their written form to the people of Israel when they were encamped at Sinai, about fifty days after they came out of Egypt ([Ex. 19:10-25](/exod#Exod.19.10)). They were written by the finger of God on two tables of stone. The first tables were broken by Moses when he brought them down from the mount (32:19), being thrown by him on the ground. At the command of God he took up into the mount two other tables, and God wrote on them “the words that were on the first tables” (34:1). These tables were afterwards placed in the ark of the covenant ([Deut. 10:5](/deut#Deut.10.5); [1 Kings 8:9](/1kgs#1Kgs.8.9)). Their subsequent history is unknown. They are as a whole called “the covenant” ([Deut. 4:13](/deut#Deut.4.13)), and “the tables of the covenant” (9:9, 11; [Heb. 9:4](/heb#Heb.9.4)), and “the testimony.”

 They are obviously “ten” in number, but their division is not fixed, hence different methods of numbering them have been adopted. The Jews make the “Preface” one of the commandments, and then combine the first and second. The Roman Catholics and Lutherans combine the first and second and divide the tenth into two. The Jews and Josephus divide them equally. The Lutherans and Roman Catholics refer three commandments to the first table and seven to the second. The Greek and Reformed Churches refer four to the first and six to the second table. The Samaritans add to the second that Gerizim is the mount of worship.",0.0,unmatched,unmatched,,

Concubine,1380,c-p353.2,Concubine,"In the Bible denotes a female conjugally united to a man, but in a relation inferior to that of a wife. Among the early Jews, from various causes, the difference between a wife and a concubine was less marked than it would be amongst us. The concubine was a wife of secondary rank. There are various laws recorded providing for their protection ([Ex. 21:7](/exod#Exod.21.7); [Deut. 21:10-14](/deut#Deut.21.10)), and setting limits to the relation they sustained to the household to which they belonged ([Gen. 21:14](/gen#Gen.21.14); [25:6](/gen#Gen.25.6)). They had no authority in the family, nor could they share in the household government.

 The immediate cause of concubinage might be gathered from the conjugal histories of Abraham and Jacob ([Gen. 16](/gen#Gen.16);[30](/gen#Gen.30)). But in process of time the custom of concubinage degenerated, and laws were made to restrain and regulate it ([Ex. 21:7-9](/exod#Exod.21.7)).

 Christianity has restored the sacred institution of marriage to its original character, and concubinage is ranked with the sins of fornication and adultery ([Matt. 19:5-9](/matt#Matt.19.5); [1 Cor. 7:2](/1cor#1Cor.7.2)).",0.0,unmatched,unmatched,,

In carrying out this work he stopped “the waters of the fountains which were without the city” i.e., “the upper water-course of Gihon”, and conveyed it down from the west through a canal into the city, so that in case of a siege the inhabitants of the city might have a supply of water, which would thus be withdrawn from the enemy.

Coney,1383,c-p359.1,Coney,"(Heb. shaphan; i.e., “the hider”), an animal which inhabits the mountain gorges and the rocky districts of Arabia Petraea and the Holy Land. “The conies are but a feeble folk, yet make they their houses in the rocks” ([Prov. 30:26](/prov#Prov.30.26); [Ps. 104:18](/ps#Ps.104.18)).

 The animal intended by this name is known among naturalists as the Hyrax Syriacus. It is neither a ruminant nor a rodent, but is regarded as akin to the rhinoceros. When it is said to “chew the cud,” the Hebrew word so used does not necessarily imply the possession of a ruminant stomach. “The lawgiver speaks according to appearances; and no one can watch the constant motion of the little creature’s jaws, as it sits continually working its teeth, without recognizing the naturalness of the expression” (Tristram, Natural History of the Bible). It is about the size and color of a rabbit, though clumsier in structure, and without a tail. Its feet are not formed for digging, and therefore it has its home not in burrows but in the clefts of the rocks. “Coney” is an obsolete English word for “rabbit.”",0.0,unmatched,unmatched,,

Copper,1400,c-p379.2,Copper,"Derived from the Greek kupros (the island of Cyprus), called “Cyprian brass,” occurs only in the Authorized Version in [Ezra 8:27](/ezra#Ezra.8.27).

The “bow of steel” ([Job 20:24](/job#Job.20.24); [Ps. 18:34](/ps#Ps.18.34)) should have been “bow of copper” (or “brass,” as in the R.V.). The vessels of “fine copper” of [Ezra 8:27](/ezra#Ezra.8.27) were probably similar to those of “bright brass” mentioned in [1 Kings 7:45](/1kgs#1Kgs.7.45); [Dan. 10:6](/dan#Dan.10.6).

 Tubal-cain was the first artificer in brass and iron ([Gen. 4:22](/gen#Gen.4.22)). Hiram was noted as a worker in brass ([1 Kings 7:14](/1kgs#1Kgs.7.14)).

 The coral is a cretaceous marine product, the deposit by minute polypous animals of calcareous matter in cells in which the animal lives. It is of numberless shapes as it grows, but usually is branched like a tree. Great coral reefs and coral islands abound in the Red Sea, whence probably the Hebrews derived their knowledge of it.

Land, however, so dedicated might be redeemed before the year of jubilee ([Lev. 27:16-24](/lev#Lev.27.16)).

Cord,1404,c-p386.3,Cord,"Frequently used in its proper sense, for fastening a tent ([Ex. 35:18](/exod#Exod.35.18); [39:40](/exod#Exod.39.40)), yoking animals to a cart ([Isa. 5:18](/isa#Isa.5.18)), binding prisoners ([Judg. 15:13](/judg#Judg.15.13); [Ps. 2:3](/ps#Ps.2.3); [129:4](/ps#Ps.129.4)), and measuring ground ([2 Sam. 8](/2sam#2Sam.8);[2](/2sam#2Sam.2); [Ps. 78:55](/ps#Ps.78.55)). Figuratively, death is spoken of as the giving way of the tent-cord ([Job 4:21](/job#Job.4.21). “Is not their tent-cord plucked up?” R.V.). To gird one’s self with a cord was a token of sorrow and humiliation. To stretch a line over a city meant to level it with the ground ([Lam. 2:8](/lam#Lam.2.8)). The “cords of sin” are the consequences or fruits of sin ([Prov. 5:22](/prov#Prov.5.22)). A “threefold cord” is a symbol of union ([Eccl. 4:12](/eccl#Eccl.4.12)). The “cords of a man” ([Hos. 11:4](/hos#Hos.11.4)) means that men employ, in inducing each other, methods such as are suitable to men, and not “cords” such as oxen are led by. Isaiah (5:18) says, “Woe unto them that draw iniquity with cords of vanity, and sin as it were with a cart rope.” This verse is thus given in the Chaldee paraphrase: “Woe to those who begin to sin by little and little, drawing sin by cords of vanity: these sins grow and increase till they are strong and are like a cart rope.” This may be the true meaning. The wicked at first draw sin with a slender cord; but by-and-by their sins increase, and they are drawn after them by a cart rope. Henderson in his commentary says: “The meaning is that the persons described were not satisfied with ordinary modes of provoking the Deity, and the consequent ordinary approach of his vengeance, but, as it were, yoked themselves in the harness of iniquity, and, putting forth all their strength, drew down upon themselves, with accelerated speed, the load of punishment which their sins deserved.”",0.0,unmatched,unmatched,,

It is the Coriandrum sativum of botanists, an umbelliferous annual plant with a round stalk, about two feet high. It is widely cultivated in Eastern countries and in the south of Europe for the sake of its seeds, which are in the form of a little ball of the size of a peppercorn.

Corinth,1406,c-p388.3,Corinth,"A Grecian city, on the isthmus which joins the Peloponnesus to the mainland of Greece. It is about 48 miles west of Athens. The ancient city was destroyed by the Romans (B.C. 146), and that mentioned in the New Testament was quite a new city, having been rebuilt about a century afterwards and peopled by a colony of freedmen from Rome. It became under the Romans the seat of government for Southern Greece or Achaia ([Acts 18:12-16](/acts#Acts.18.12)). It was noted for its wealth, and for the luxurious and immoral and vicious habits of the people. It had a large mixed population of Romans, Greeks, and Jews. When Paul first visited the city (A.D. 51 or 52), Gallio, the brother of Seneca, was proconsul. Here Paul resided for eighteen months (18:1-18). Here he first became aquainted with Aquila and Priscilla, and soon after his departure Apollos came to it from Ephesus. After an interval he visited it a second time, and remained for three months (20:3). During this second visit his Epistle to the Romans was written (probably A.D. 55). Although there were many Jewish converts at Corinth, yet the Gentile element prevailed in the church there.

 Some have argued from [2 Cor. 12:14](/2cor#2Cor.12.14); [13:1](/2cor#2Cor.13.1), that Paul visited Corinth a third time (i.e., that on some unrecorded occasion he visited the city between what are usually called the first and second visits). But the passages referred to only indicate Paul’s intention to visit Corinth (comp. [1 Cor. 16:5](/1cor#1Cor.16.5), where the Greek present tense denotes an intention), an intention which was in some way frustrated.

 The news which had reached him, however, from Corinth frustrated his plan. He had heard of the abuses and contentions that had arisen among them, first from Apollos ([Acts 19:1](/acts#Acts.19.1)), and then from a letter they had written him on the subject, and also from some of the “household of Chloe,” and from Stephanas and his two friends who had visited him ([1 Cor. 1:11](/1cor#1Cor.1.11); [16:17](/1cor#1Cor.16.17)). Paul thereupon wrote this letter, for the purpose of checking the factious spirit and correcting the erroneous opinions that had sprung up among them, and remedying the many abuses and disorderly practices that prevailed. Titus and a brother whose name is not given were probably the bearers of the letter ([2 Cor. 2:13](/2cor#2Cor.2.13); [8:6](/2cor#2Cor.8.6), [16-18](/2cor#2Cor.8.16)).

 This epistle “shows the powerful self-control of the apostle in spite of his physical weakness, his distressed circumstances, his incessant troubles, and his emotional nature. It was written, he tells us, in bitter anguish, ‘out of much affliction and pressure of heart...and with streaming eyes’ ([2 Cor. 2:4](/2cor#2Cor.2.4)); yet he restrained the expression of his feelings, and wrote with a dignity and holy calm which he thought most calculated to win back his erring children. It gives a vivid picture of the early church...It entirely dissipates the dream that the apostolic church was in an exceptional condition of holiness of life or purity of doctrine.” The apostle in this epistle unfolds and applies great principles fitted to guide the church of all ages in dealing with the same and kindred evils in whatever form they may appear.

 This is one of the epistles the authenticity of which has never been called in question by critics of any school, so many and so conclusive are the evidences of its Pauline origin.

 The subscription to this epistle states erroneously in the Authorized Version that it was written at Philippi. This error arose from a mistranslation of [1 Cor. 16:5](/1cor#1Cor.16.5), “For I do pass through Macedonia,” which was interpreted as meaning, “I am passing through Macedonia.” In 16:8 he declares his intention of remaining some time longer in Ephesus.

Pursuing the usual route, he reached Troas, the port of departure for Europe. Here he expected to meet with Titus, whom he had sent from Ephesus to Corinth, with tidings of the effects produced on the church there by the first epistle; but was disappointed ([1 Cor. 16:9](/1cor#1Cor.16.9); [2 Cor. 1:8](/2cor#2Cor.1.8); [2:12](/2cor#2Cor.2.12), [13](/2cor#2Cor.2.13)). He then left Troas and proceeded to Macedonia; and at Philippi, where he tarried, he was soon joined by Titus ([2 Cor. 7:6](/2cor#2Cor.7.6), [7](/2cor#2Cor.7.7)), who brought him good news from Corinth, and also by Timothy. Under the influence of the feelings awakened in his mind by the favourable report which Titus brought back from Corinth, this second epistle was written. It was probably written at Philippi, or, as some think, Thessalonica, early in the year A.D. 58, and was sent to Corinth by Titus. This letter he addresses not only to the church in Corinth, but also to the saints in all Achaia, i.e., in Athens, Cenchrea, and other cities in Greece.

It is applied to our Lord, who was set in highest honour ([Matt. 21:42](/matt#Matt.21.42)). He is also styled “the chief corner stone” ([Eph. 2:20](/eph#Eph.2.20); [1 Pet. 2:6-8](/1pet#1Pet.2.6)). When Zechariah (10:4), speaking of Judah, says, “Out of him came forth the corner,” he is probably to be understood as ultimately referring to the Messiah as the “corner stone.” (See  TEMPLE, SOLOMON’S.)",0.0,unmatched,unmatched,,

Covenant,1434,c-p431.7,Covenant,"A contract or agreement between two parties. In the Old Testament the Hebrew word berith is always thus translated. Berith is derived from a root which means “to cut,” and hence a covenant is a “cutting,” with reference to the cutting or dividing of animals into two parts, and the contracting parties passing between them, in making a covenant ([Gen. 15](/gen#Gen.15); [Jer. 34:18](/jer#Jer.34.18), [19](/jer#Jer.34.19)).

 The corresponding word in the New Testament Greek is diatheke, which is, however, rendered “testament” generally in the Authorized Version. It ought to be rendered, just as the word berith of the Old Testament, “covenant.”

 This word is used (1) of a covenant or compact between man and man ([Gen. 21:32](/gen#Gen.21.32)), or between tribes or nations ([1 Sam. 11:1](/1sam#1Sam.11.1); [Josh. 9:6](/josh#Josh.9.6), [15](/josh#Josh.9.15)). In entering into a convenant, Jehovah was solemnly called on to witness the transaction ([Gen. 31:50](/gen#Gen.31.50)), and hence it was called a “covenant of the Lord” ([1 Sam. 20:8](/1sam#1Sam.20.8)). The marriage compact is called “the covenant of God” ([Prov. 2:17](/prov#Prov.2.17)), because the marriage was made in God’s name. Wicked men are spoken of as acting as if they had made a “covenant with death” not to destroy them, or with hell not to devour them ([Isa. 28:15](/isa#Isa.28.15), [18](/isa#Isa.28.18)).",0.0,unmatched,unmatched,,
Covenant 1,1435,c-p431.7,Covenant,"The word is used with reference to God’s revelation of himself in the way of promise or of favour to men. Thus God’s promise to Noah after the Flood is called a covenant ([Gen. 9](/gen#Gen.9); [Jer. 33:20](/jer#Jer.33.20), “my covenant”). We have an account of God’s covernant with Abraham ([Gen. 17](/gen#Gen.17), comp. [Lev. 26:42](/lev#Lev.26.42)), of the covenant of the priesthood ([Num. 25:12](/num#Num.25.12), [13](/num#Num.25.13); [Deut. 33:9](/deut#Deut.33.9); [Neh. 13:29](/neh#Neh.13.29)), and of the covenant of Sinai ([Ex. 34:27](/exod#Exod.34.27), [28](/exod#Exod.34.28); [Lev. 26:15](/lev#Lev.26.15)), which was afterwards renewed at different times in the history of Israel ([Deut. 29](/deut#Deut.29); [Josh. 1:24](/josh#Josh.1.24); [2 Chr. 15](/2chr#2Chr.15); [23](/2chr#2Chr.23); [29](/2chr#2Chr.29); [34](/2chr#2Chr.34); [Ezra 10](/ezra#Ezra.10); [Neh. 9](/neh#Neh.9)). In conformity with human custom, God’s covenant is said to be confirmed with an oath ([Deut. 4:31](/deut#Deut.4.31); [Ps. 89:3](/ps#Ps.89.3)), and to be accompanied by a sign ([Gen. 9](/gen#Gen.9); [17](/gen#Gen.17)). Hence the covenant is called God’s “counsel,” “oath,” “promise” ([Ps. 89:3](/ps#Ps.89.3), [4](/ps#Ps.89.4); [105:8-11](/ps#Ps.105.8); [Heb. 6:13-20](/heb#Heb.6.13); [Luke 1:68-75](/luke#Luke.1.68)). God’s covenant consists wholly in the bestowal of blessing ([Isa. 59:21](/isa#Isa.59.21); [Jer. 31:33](/jer#Jer.31.33), [34](/jer#Jer.31.34)).

 The term covenant is also used to designate the regular succession of day and night ([Jer. 33:20](/jer#Jer.33.20)), the Sabbath ([Ex. 31:16](/exod#Exod.31.16)), circumcision ([Gen. 17:9](/gen#Gen.17.9), [10](/gen#Gen.17.10)), and in general any ordinance of God ([Jer. 34:13](/jer#Jer.34.13), [14](/jer#Jer.34.14)).

 A “covenant of salt” signifies an everlasting covenant, in the sealing or ratifying of which salt, as an emblem of perpetuity, is used ([Num. 18:19](/num#Num.18.19); [Lev. 2:13](/lev#Lev.2.13); [2 Chr. 13:5](/2chr#2Chr.13.5)).

 This covenant is also called a covenant of nature, as made with man in his natural or unfallen state; a covenant of life, because “life” was the promise attached to obedience; and a legal covenant, because it demanded perfect obedience to the law.

 The “tree of life” was the outward sign and seal of that life which was promised in the covenant, and hence it is usually called the seal of that covenant.

 This covenant is abrogated under the gospel, inasmuch as Christ has fulfilled all its conditions in behalf of his people, and now offers salvation on the condition of faith. It is still in force, however, as it rests on the immutable justice of God, and is binding on all who have not fled to Christ and accepted his righteousness.

 CONVENANT OF GRACE, the eternal plan of redemption entered into by the three persons of the Godhead, and carried out by them in its several parts. In it the Father represented the Godhead in its indivisible sovereignty, and the Son his people as their surety ([John 17:4](/john#John.17.4), [6](/john#John.17.6), [9](/john#John.17.9); [Isa. 42:6](/isa#Isa.42.6); [Ps. 89:3](/ps#Ps.89.3)).

Crown 2,1456,c-p464.2,Crown,"The more general name in Hebrew for a crown is ’atarah, meaning a “circlet.” This is used of crowns and head ornaments of divers kinds, including royal crowns. Such was the crown taken from the king of Ammon by David ([2 Sam. 12:30](/2sam#2Sam.12.30)). The crown worn by the Assyrian kings was a high mitre, sometimes adorned with flowers. There are sculptures also representing the crowns worn by the early Egyptian and Persian kings. Sometimes a diadem surrounded the royal head-dress of two or three fillets. This probably signified that the wearer had dominion over two or three countries.

Crowns were worn sometimes to represent honour and power ([Ezek. 23:42](/ezek#Ezek.23.42)). They were worn at marriages ([Cant. 3:11](/song#Song.3.11); [Isa. 61:10](/isa#Isa.61.10), “ornaments;” R.V., “a garland”), and at feasts and public festivals.

 The crown was among the Romans and Greeks a symbol of victory and reward. The crown or wreath worn by the victors in the Olympic games was made of leaves of the wild olive; in the Pythian games, of laurel; in the Nemean games, of parsley; and in the Isthmian games, of the pine. The Romans bestowed the “civic crown” on him who saved the life of a citizen. It was made of the leaves of the oak. In opposition to all these fading crowns the apostles speak of the incorruptible crown, the crown of life ([James 1:12](/jas#Jas.1.12); [Rev. 2:10](/rev#Rev.2.10)) “that fadeth not away” ([1 Pet. 5:4](/1pet#1Pet.5.4), Gr. amarantinos; comp. 1:4).

Crucifixion,1459,c-p469.3,Crucifixion,"A common mode of punishment among heathen nations in early times. It is not certain whether it was known among the ancient Jews; probably it was not. The modes of capital punishment according to the Mosaic law were, by the sword ([Ex. 21](/exod#Exod.21)), strangling, fire ([Lev. 20](/lev#Lev.20)), and stoning ([Deut. 21](/deut#Deut.21)).

 This was regarded as the most horrible form of death, and to a Jew it would acquire greater horror from the curse in [Deut. 21:23](/deut#Deut.21.23).

 This punishment began by subjecting the sufferer to scourging. In the case of our Lord, however, his scourging was rather before the sentence was passed upon him, and was inflicted by Pilate for the purpose, probably, of exciting pity and procuring his escape from further punishment ([Luke 23:22](/luke#Luke.23.22); [John 19:1](/john#John.19.1)).

 The condemned one carried his own cross to the place of execution, which was outside the city, in some conspicuous place set apart for the purpose. Before the nailing to the cross took place, a medicated cup of vinegar mixed with gall and myrrh (the sopor) was given, for the purpose of deadening the pangs of the sufferer. Our Lord refused this cup, that his senses might be clear ([Matt. 27:34](/matt#Matt.27.34)). The spongeful of vinegar, sour wine, posca, the common drink of the Roman soldiers, which was put on a hyssop stalk and offered to our Lord in contemptuous pity ([Matt. 27:48](/matt#Matt.27.48); [Luke 23:36](/luke#Luke.23.36)), he tasted to allay the agonies of his thirst ([John 19:29](/john#John.19.29)). The accounts given of the crucifixion of our Lord are in entire agreement with the customs and practices of the Roman in such cases. He was crucified between two “malefactors” ([Isa. 53:12](/isa#Isa.53.12); [Luke 23:32](/luke#Luke.23.32)), and was watched by a party of four soldiers ([John 19:23](/john#John.19.23); [Matt. 27:36](/matt#Matt.27.36), [54](/matt#Matt.27.54)), with their centurion. The “breaking of the legs” of the malefactors was intended to hasten death, and put them out of misery ([John 19:31](/john#John.19.31)); but the unusual rapidity of our Lord’s death (19:33) was due to his previous sufferings and his great mental anguish. The omission of the breaking of his legs was the fulfilment of a type ([Ex. 12:46](/exod#Exod.12.46)). He literally died of a broken heart, a ruptured heart, and hence the flowing of blood and water from the wound made by the soldier’s spear ([John 19:34](/john#John.19.34)). Our Lord uttered seven memorable words from the cross, namely, (1) [Luke 23:34](/luke#Luke.23.34); ([2](/luke#Luke.2)) 23:43; (3) [John 19:26](/john#John.19.26); ([4](/john#John.4)) [Matt. 27:46](/matt#Matt.27.46), [Mark 15:34](/mark#Mark.15.34); ([5](/mark#Mark.5)) [John 19:28](/john#John.19.28); ([6](/john#John.6)) 19:30; (7) [Luke 23:46](/luke#Luke.23.46).",0.0,unmatched,unmatched,,

Cup,1466,c-p481.4,Cup,"A wine-cup ([Gen. 40:11](/gen#Gen.40.11), [21](/gen#Gen.40.21)), various forms of which are found on Assyrian and Egyptian monuments. All Solomon’s drinking vessels were of gold ([1 Kings 10](/1kgs#1Kgs.10): 21). The cups mentioned in the New Testament were made after Roman and Greek models, and were sometimes of gold ([Rev. 17:4](/rev#Rev.17.4)).

 The art of divining by means of a cup was practiced in Egypt ([Gen. 44:2-17](/gen#Gen.44.2)), and in the East generally.

 The “cup of salvation” ([Ps. 116:13](/ps#Ps.116.13)) is the cup of thanksgiving for the great salvation. The “cup of consolation” ([Jer. 16:7](/jer#Jer.16.7)) refers to the custom of friends sending viands and wine to console relatives in mourning ([Prov. 31:6](/prov#Prov.31.6)). In [1 Cor. 10:16](/1cor#1Cor.10.16), the “cup of blessing” is contrasted with the “cup of devils” ([1 Cor. 10:21](/1cor#1Cor.10.21)). The sacramental cup is the “cup of blessing,” because of blessing pronounced over it ([Matt. 26:27](/matt#Matt.26.27); [Luke 22:17](/luke#Luke.22.17)). The “portion of the cup” ([Ps. 11:6](/ps#Ps.11.6); [16:5](/ps#Ps.16.5)) denotes one’s condition of life, prosperous or adverse. A “cup” is also a type of sensual allurement ([Jer. 51:7](/jer#Jer.51.7); [Prov. 23:31](/prov#Prov.23.31); [Rev. 17:4](/rev#Rev.17.4)).

From him the land of Cush seems to have derived its name. The question of the precise locality of the land of Cush has given rise to not a little controversy. The second river of Paradise surrounded the whole land of Cush ([Gen. 2:13](/gen#Gen.2.13), R.V.). The term Cush is in the Old Testament generally applied to the countries south of the Israelites. It was the southern limit of Egypt ([Ezek. 29:10](/ezek#Ezek.29.10), A.V. “Ethiopia,” Heb. Cush), with which it is generally associated ([Ps. 68:31](/ps#Ps.68.31); [Isa. 18:1](/isa#Isa.18.1); [Jer. 46:9](/jer#Jer.46.9), etc.). It stands also associated with Elam ([Isa. 11:11](/isa#Isa.11.11)), with Persia ([Ezek. 38:5](/ezek#Ezek.38.5)), and with the Sabeans ([Isa. 45:14](/isa#Isa.45.14)). From these facts it has been inferred that Cush included Arabia and the country on the west coast of the Red Sea. Rawlinson takes it to be the country still known as Khuzi-stan, on the east side of the Lower Tigris. But there are intimations which warrant the conclusion that there was also a Cush in Africa, the Ethiopia (so called by the Greeks) of Africa. Ezekiel speaks (29:10; comp. 30:4-6) of it as lying south of Egypt. It was the country now known to us as Nubia and Abyssinia ([Isa. 18:1](/isa#Isa.18.1); [Zeph. 3:10](/zeph#Zeph.3.10), Heb. Cush). In ancient Egyptian inscriptions Ethiopia is termed Kesh. The Cushites appear to have spread along extensive tracts, stretching from the Upper Nile to the Euphrates and Tigris. At an early period there was a stream of migration of Cushites “from Ethiopia, properly so called, through Arabia, Babylonia, and Persia, to Western India.” The Hamite races, soon after their arrival in Africa, began to spread north, east, and west. Three branches of the Cushite or Ethiopian stock, moving from Western Asia, settled in the regions contiguous to the Persian Gulf. One branch, called the Cossaeans, settled in the mountainous district on the east of the Tigris, known afterwards as Susiana; another occupied the lower regions of the Euphrates and the Tigris; while a third colonized the southern shores and islands of the gulf, whence they afterwards emigrated to the Mediterranean and settled on the coast of Palestine as the Phoenicians.

It was originally inhabited by Phoenicians. In B.C. 477 it fell under the dominion of the Greeks; and became a Roman province B.C. 58. In ancient times it was a centre of great commercial activity. Corn and wine and oil were produced here in the greatest perfection. It was rich also in timber and in mineral wealth.

 It is first mentioned in the New Testament ([Acts 4:36](/acts#Acts.4.36)) as the native place of Barnabas. It was the scene of Paul’s first missionary labours (13:4-13), when he and Barnabas and John Mark were sent forth by the church of Antioch. It was afterwards visited by Barnabas and Mark alone (15:39). Mnason, an “old disciple,” probaly one of the converts of the day of Pentecost belonging to this island, is mentioned (21:16). It is also mentioned in connection with the voyages of Paul ([Acts 21:3](/acts#Acts.21.3); [27:4](/acts#Acts.27.4)).

Cyrus,1491,c-p509.3,Cyrus,"(Heb. Ko’resh), the celebrated “King of Persia” (Elam) who was conqueror of Babylon, and issued the decree of liberation to the Jews ([Ezra 1:1](/ezra#Ezra.1.1), [2](/ezra#Ezra.1.2)). He was the son of Cambyses, the prince of Persia, and was born about B.C. 599. In the year B.C. 559 he became king of Persia, the kingdom of Media being added to it partly by conquest. Cyrus was a great military leader, bent on universal conquest. Babylon fell before his army (B.C. 538) on the night of Belshazzar’s feast ([Dan. 5:30](/dan#Dan.5.30)), and then the ancient dominion of Assyria was also added to his empire (cf., “Go up, O Elam”, [Isa. 21:2](/isa#Isa.21.2)).

 Hitherto the great kings of the earth had only oppressed the Jews. Cyrus was to them as a “shepherd” ([Isa. 44:28](/isa#Isa.44.28); [45:1](/isa#Isa.45.1)). God employed him in doing service to his ancient people. He may posibly have gained, through contact with the Jews, some knowledge of their religion.

 The “first year of Cyrus” ([Ezra 1:1](/ezra#Ezra.1.1)) is not the year of his elevation to power over the Medes, nor over the Persians, nor the year of the fall of Babylon, but the year succeeding the two years during which “Darius the Mede” was viceroy in Babylon after its fall. At this time only (B.C. 536) Cyrus became actual king over Palestine, which became a part of his Babylonian empire. The edict of Cyrus for the rebuilding of Jerusalem marked a great epoch in the history of the Jewish people ([2 Chr. 36:22](/2chr#2Chr.36.22), [23](/2chr#2Chr.36.23); [Ezra 1:1-4](/ezra#Ezra.1.1); [4:3](/ezra#Ezra.4.3); [5:13-17](/ezra#Ezra.5.13); [6:3-5](/ezra#Ezra.6.3)).

 This decree was discovered “at Achmetha [R.V. marg., “Ecbatana”], in the palace that is in the province of the Medes” ([Ezra 6:2](/ezra#Ezra.6.2)). A chronicle drawn up just after the conquest of Babylonia by Cyrus, gives the history of the reign of Nabonidus (Nabunahid), the last king of Babylon, and of the fall of the Babylonian empire. In B.C. 538 there was a revolt in Southern Babylonia, while the army of Cyrus entered the country from the north. In June the Babylonian army was completely defeated at Opis, and immediately afterwards Sippara opened its gates to the conqueror. Gobryas (Ugbaru), the governor of Kurdistan, was then sent to Babylon, which surrendered “without fighting,” and the daily services in the temples continued without a break. In October, Cyrus himself arrived, and proclaimed a general amnesty, which was communicated by Gobryas to “all the province of Babylon,” of which he had been made governor. Meanwhile, Nabonidus, who had concealed himself, was captured, but treated honourably; and when his wife died, Cambyses, the son of Cyrus, conducted the funeral. Cyrus now assumed the title of “king of Babylon,” claimed to be the descendant of the ancient kings, and made rich offerings to the temples. At the same time he allowed the foreign populations who had been deported to Babylonia to return to their old homes, carrying with them the images of their gods. Among these populations were the Jews, who, as they had no images, took with them the sacred vessels of the temple.",0.0,person,cyrus_968,cyrus_968,

 The situation of this city is said to be the most beautiful of all Western Asia. It is mentioned among the conquests of the Egyptian king Thothmes III. (B.C. 1500), and in the Amarna tablets (B.C. 1400).

 It is first mentioned in Scripture in connection with Abraham’s victory over the confederate kings under Chedorlaomer ([Gen. 14:15](/gen#Gen.14.15)). It was the native place of Abraham’s steward (15:2). It is not again noticed till the time of David, when “the Syrians of Damascus came to succour Hadadezer” (q.v.), [2 Sam. 8:5](/2sam#2Sam.8.5); [1 Chr. 18:5](/1chr#1Chr.18.5). In the reign of Solomon, Rezon became leader of a band who revolted from Hadadezer ([1 Kings 11:23](/1kgs#1Kgs.11.23)), and betaking themselves to Damascus, settled there and made their leader king. There was a long war, with varying success, between the Israelites and Syrians, who at a later period became allies of Israel against Judah ([2 Kings 15:37](/2kgs#2Kgs.15.37)).

 The Syrians were at length subdued by the Assyrians, the city of Damascus was taken and destroyed, and the inhabitants carried captive into Assyria ([2 Kings 16:7-9](/2kgs#2Kgs.16.7); comp. [Isa. 7:8](/isa#Isa.7.8)). In this, prophecy was fulfilled ([Isa. 17:1](/isa#Isa.17.1); [Amos 1:4](/amos#Amos.1.4); [Jer. 49:24](/jer#Jer.49.24)). The kingdom of Syria remained a province of Assyria till the capture of Nineveh by the Medes (B.C. 625), when it fell under the conquerors. After passing through various vicissitudes, Syria was invaded by the Romans (B.C. 64), and Damascus became the seat of the government of the province. In A.D. 37 Aretas, the king of Arabia, became master of Damascus, having driven back Herod Antipas.

 This city is memorable as the scene of Saul’s conversion ([Acts 9:1-25](/acts#Acts.9.1)).

 In [1 Cor. 11:29](/1cor#1Cor.11.29) (R.V., “judgment”) this word means condemnation, in the sense of exposure to severe temporal judgements from God, as the following verse explains.

 In [Rom. 14:23](/rom#Rom.14.23) the word “damned” means “condemned” by one’s own conscience, as well as by the Word of God. The apostle shows here that many things which are lawful are not expedient; and that in using our Christian liberty the question should not simply be, Is this course I follow lawful? but also, Can I follow it without doing injury to the spiritual interests of a brother in Christ? He that “doubteth”, i.e., is not clear in his conscience as to “meats”, will violate his conscience “if he eat,” and in eating is condemned; and thus one ought not so to use his liberty as to lead one who is “weak” to bring upon himself this condemnation.",0.0,unmatched,unmatched,,

The blessing pronounced on him by his father was, “Dan shall judge his people” (49:16), probably in allusion to the judgeship of Samson, who was of the tribe of Dan.

 The tribe of Dan had their place in the march through the wilderness on the north side of the tabernacle ([Num. 2:25](/num#Num.2.25), [31](/num#Num.2.31); 10:25). It was the last of the tribes to receive a portion in the Land of Promise. Its position and extent are described in [Josh. 19:40-48](/josh#Josh.19.40).

 The territory of Dan extended from the west of that of Ephraim and Benjamin to the sea. It was a small territory, but was very fertile. It included in it, among others, the cities of Lydda, Ekron, and Joppa, which formed its northern boundary. But this district was too limited. “Squeezed into the narrow strip between the mountains and the sea, its energies were great beyond its numbers.” Being pressed by the Amorites and the Philistines, whom they were unable to conquer, they longed for a wider space. They accordingly sent out five spies from two of their towns, who went north to the sources of the Jordan, and brought back a favourable report regarding that region. “Arise,” they said, “be not slothful to go, and to possess the land,” for it is “a place where there is no want of any thing that is in the earth” ([Judg. 18:10](/judg#Judg.18.10)). On receiving this report, 600 Danites girded on their weapons of war, and taking with them their wives and their children, marched to the foot of Hermon, and fought against Leshem, and took it from the Sidonians, and dwelt therein, and changed the name of the conquered town to Dan ([Josh. 19:47](/josh#Josh.19.47)). This new city of Dan became to them a new home, and was wont to be spoken of as the northern limit of Palestine, the length of which came to be denoted by the expression “from Dan to Beersheba”, i.e., about 144 miles.

 “But like Lot under a similar temptation, they seem to have succumbed to the evil influences around them, and to have sunk down into a condition of semi-heathenism from which they never emerged. The mounds of ruins which mark the site of the city show that it covered a considerable extent of ground. But there remains no record of any noble deed wrought by the degenerate tribe. Their name disappears from the roll-book of the natural and the spiritual Israel.”, Manning’s Those Holy Fields.

It is the rendering of a word (rakad’) which means to skip or leap for joy, in [Eccl. 3:4](/eccl#Eccl.3.4); [Job 21:11](/job#Job.21.11); [Isa. 13:21](/isa#Isa.13.21), etc.

 In the New Testament it is in like manner the translation of different Greek words, circular motion ([Luke 15:25](/luke#Luke.15.25)); leaping up and down in concert ([Matt. 11:17](/matt#Matt.11.17)), and by a single person ([Matt. 14:6](/matt#Matt.14.6)).

 It is spoken of as symbolical of rejoicing ([Eccl. 3:4](/eccl#Eccl.3.4). Comp. [Ps. 30:11](/ps#Ps.30.11); [Matt. 11](/matt#Matt.11): 17). The Hebrews had their sacred dances expressive of joy and thanksgiving, when the performers were usually females ([Ex. 15:20](/exod#Exod.15.20); [1 Sam. 18:6](/1sam#1Sam.18.6)).

 The ancient dance was very different from that common among Western nations. It was usually the part of the women only ([Ex. 15:20](/exod#Exod.15.20); [Judg. 11:34](/judg#Judg.11.34); comp. 5:1). Hence the peculiarity of David’s conduct in dancing before the ark of the Lord ([2 Sam. 6:14](/2sam#2Sam.6.14)). The women took part in it with their timbrels. Michal should, in accordance with the example of Miriam and others, have herself led the female choir, instead of keeping aloof on the occasion and “looking through the window.” David led the choir “uncovered”, i.e., wearing only the ephod or linen tunic. He thought only of the honour of God, and forgot himself.

 From being reserved for occasions of religious worship and festivity, it came gradually to be practised in common life on occasions of rejoicing ([Jer. 31:4](/jer#Jer.31.4)).

At the first deportation of the Jews by Nebuchadnezzar (the kingdom of Israel had come to an end nearly a century before), or immediately after his victory over the Egyptians at the second battle of Carchemish, in the fourth year of the reign of Jehoiakim (B.C. 606), Daniel and other three noble youths were carried off to Babylon, along with part of the vessels of the temple. There he was obliged to enter into the service of the king of Babylon, and in accordance with the custom of the age received the Chaldean name of Belteshazzar, i.e., “prince of Bel,” or “Bel protect the king!” His residence in Babylon was very probably in the palace of Nebuchadnezzar, now identified with a mass of shapeless mounds called the Kasr, on the right bank of the river.

 His training in the schools of the wise men in Babylon ([Dan. 1:4](/dan#Dan.1.4)) was to fit him for service to the empire.

His habit of attention gained during his education in Jerusalem enabled him soon to master the wisdom and learning of the Chaldeans, and even to excel his compeers.

 At the close of his three years of discipline and training in the royal schools, Daniel was distinguished for his proficiency in the “wisdom” of his day, and was brought out into public life. He soon became known for his skill in the interpretation of dreams (1:17; 2:14), and rose to the rank of governor of the province of Babylon, and became “chief of the governors” (Chald. Rab-signin) over all the wise men of Babylon. He made known and also interpreted Nebuchadnezzar’s dream; and many years afterwards, when he was now an old man, amid the alarm and consternation of the terrible night of Belshazzar’s impious feast, he was called in at the instance of the queen-mother (perhaps Nitocris, the daughter of Nebuchadnezzar) to interpret the mysterious handwriting on the wall. He was rewarded with a purple robe and elevation to the rank of “third ruler.” The place of “second ruler” was held by Belshazzar as associated with his father, Nabonidus, on the throne (5:16). Daniel interpreted the handwriting, and “in that night was Belshazzar the king of the Chaldeans slain.”

 After the taking of Babylon, Cyrus, who was now master of all Asia from India to the Dardanelles, placed Darius (q.v.), a Median prince, on the throne, during the two years of whose reign Daniel held the office of first of the “three presidents” of the empire, and was thus practically at the head of affairs, no doubt interesting himself in the prospects of the captive Jews ([Dan. 9](/dan#Dan.9)), whom he had at last the happiness of seeing restored to their own land, although he did not return with them, but remained still in Babylon. His fidelity to God exposed him to persecution, and he was cast into a den of lions, but was miraculously delivered; after which Darius issued a decree enjoining reverence for “the God of Daniel” (6:26). He “prospered in the reign of Darius, and in the reign of Cyrus the Persian,” whom he probably greatly influenced in the matter of the decree which put an end to the Captivity (B.C. 536).

 He had a series of prophetic visions vouch-safed to him which opened up the prospect of a glorious future for the people of God, and must have imparted peace and gladness to his spirit in his old age as he waited on at his post till the “end of the days.” The time and circumstances of his death are not recorded. He probably died at Susa, about eighty-five years of age.

 Ezekiel, with whom he was contemporary, mentions him as a pattern of righteousness (14:14, 20) and wisdom (28:3).",2.0,unmatched,unmatched,,
"Daniel, Book of",1511,d-p41.2,"Daniel, Book of","Is ranked by the Jews in that division of their Bible called the Hagiographa (Heb. Khethubim). It consists of two distinct parts. The first part, consisting of the first six chapters, is chiefly historical; and the second part, consisting of the remaining six chapters, is chiefly prophetical.

 The historical part of the book treats of the period of the Captivity. Daniel is “the historian of the Captivity, the writer who alone furnishes any series of events for that dark and dismal period during which the harp of Israel hung on the trees that grew by the Euphrates. His narrative may be said in general to intervene between Kings and Chronicles on the one hand and Ezra on the other, or (more strictly) to fill out the sketch which the author of the Chronicles gives in a single verse in his last chapter: ‘And them that had escaped from the sword carried he [i.e., Nebuchadnezzar] away to Babylon; where they were servants to him and his sons until the reign of the kingdom of Persia’” ([2 Chr. 36:20](/2chr#2Chr.36.20)).

 The prophetical part consists of three visions and one lengthened prophetical communication.

Darius 1,1520,d-p49.5,Darius,"Darius the Mede ([Dan. 11:1](/dan#Dan.11.1)), “the son of Ahasuerus, of the seed of the Medes” (9:1). On the death of Belshazzar the Chaldean he “received the kingdom” of Babylon as viceroy from Cyrus. During his brief reign (B.C. 538-536) Daniel was promoted to the highest dignity ([Dan. 6:1](/dan#Dan.6.1), [2](/dan#Dan.6.2)); but on account of the malice of his enemies he was cast into the den of lions. After his miraculous escape, a decree was issued by Darius enjoining “reverence for the God of Daniel” (6:26). This king was probably the “Astyages” of the Greek historians. Nothing can, however, be with certainty affirmed regarding him. Some are of opinion that the name “Darius” is simply a name of office, equivalent to “governor,” and that the “Gobryas” of the inscriptions was the person intended by the name.",1.0,unmatched,unmatched,,
Darius 2,1521,d-p49.5,Darius,"Darius, king of Persia, was the son of Hystaspes, of the royal family of the Achaemenidae. He did not immediately succeed Cyrus on the throne. There were two intermediate kings, viz., Cambyses (the Ahasuerus of Ezra), the son of Cyrus, who reigned from B.C. 529-522, and was succeeded by a usurper named Smerdis, who occupied the throne only ten months, and was succeeded by this Darius (B.C. 521-486). Smerdis was a Margian, and therefore had no sympathy with Cyrus and Cambyses in the manner in which they had treated the Jews. He issued a decree prohibiting the restoration of the temple and of Jerusalem ([Ezra 4:17-22](/ezra#Ezra.4.17)). But soon after his death and the accession of Darius, the Jews resumed their work, thinking that the edict of Smerdis would be now null and void, as Darius was in known harmony with the religious policy of Cyrus. The enemies of the Jews lost no time in bringing the matter under the notice of Darius, who caused search to be made for the decree of Cyrus (q.v.). It was not found at Babylon, but at Achmetha ([Ezra 6:2](/ezra#Ezra.6.2)); and Darius forthwith issued a new decree, giving the Jews full liberty to prosecute their work, at the same time requiring the Syrian satrap and his subordinates to give them all needed help. It was with the army of this king that the Greeks fought the famous battle of Marathon (B.C. 490). During his reign the Jews enjoyed much peace and prosperity.

Darkness,1523,d-p52.2,Darkness,"The plague (the ninth) of darkness in Egypt ([Ex. 10:21](/exod#Exod.10.21)) is described as darkness “which may be felt.” It covered “all the land of Egypt,” so that “they saw not one another.” It did not extend to the land of Goshen (ver. 23).

 When Jesus hung upon the cross ([Matt. 27:45](/matt#Matt.27.45); [Luke 23:44](/luke#Luke.23.44)), from the “sixth hour there was darkness over all the land unto the ninth hour.”

 On Mount Sinai, Moses ([Ex. 20:21](/exod#Exod.20.21)) “drew near unto the thick darkness where God was.” This was the “thick cloud upon the mount” in which Jehovah was when he spake unto Moses there. The Lord dwelt in the cloud upon the mercy-seat ([1 Kings 8:12](/1kgs#1Kgs.8.12)), the cloud of glory. When the psalmist ([Ps. 97:2](/ps#Ps.97.2)) describes the inscrutable nature of God’s workings among the sons of men, he says, “Clouds and darkness are round about him.” God dwells in thick darkness.

 Darkness ([Isa. 13:9](/isa#Isa.13.9), [10](/isa#Isa.13.10); [Matt. 24:29](/matt#Matt.24.29)) also is a symbol of the judgments that attend on the coming of the Lord.

It is also a symbol of ignorance ([Isa. 9:2](/isa#Isa.9.2); [60:2](/isa#Isa.60.2); [Matt. 6:23](/matt#Matt.6.23)) and of death ([Job 10:21](/job#Job.10.21); [17:13](/job#Job.17.13)).",0.0,unmatched,unmatched,,

David,1535,d-p61.10,David,"Beloved, the eighth and youngest son of Jesse, a citizen of Bethlehem. His father seems to have been a man in humble life. His mother’s name is not recorded. Some think she was the Nahash of [2 Sam. 17:25](/2sam#2Sam.17.25). As to his personal appearance, we only know that he was red-haired, with beautiful eyes and a fair face ([1 Sam. 16:12](/1sam#1Sam.16.12); [17:42](/1sam#1Sam.17.42)).

 His early occupation was that of tending his father’s sheep on the uplands of Judah. From what we know of his after history, doubtless he frequently beguiled his time, when thus engaged, with his shepherd’s flute, while he drank in the many lessons taught him by the varied scenes spread around him. His first recorded exploits were his encounters with the wild beasts of the field. He mentions that with his own unaided hand he slew a lion and also a bear, when they came out against his flock, beating them to death in open conflict with his club ([1 Sam. 17:34](/1sam#1Sam.17.34), [35](/1sam#1Sam.17.35)).

 While David, in the freshness of ruddy youth, was thus engaged with his flocks, Samuel paid an unexpected visit to Bethlehem, having been guided thither by divine direction ([1 Sam. 16:1-13](/1sam#1Sam.16.1)). There he offered up sacrifice, and called the elders of Israel and Jesse’s family to the sacrificial meal. Among all who appeared before him he failed to discover the one he sought. David was sent for, and the prophet immediately recognized him as the chosen of God, chosen to succeed Saul, who was now departing from the ways of God, on the throne of the kingdom. He accordingly, in anticipation, poured on his head the anointing oil. David went back again to his shepherd life, but “the Spirit of the Lord came upon David from that day forward,” and “the Spirit of the Lord departed from Saul” ([1 Sam. 16:13](/1sam#1Sam.16.13), [14](/1sam#1Sam.16.14)).

 Not long after this David was sent for to soothe with his harp the troubled spirit of Saul, who suffered from a strange melancholy dejection. He played before the king so skilfully that Saul was greatly cheered, and began to entertain great affection for the young shepherd. After this he went home to Bethlehem. But he soon again came into prominence. The armies of the Philistines and of Israel were in battle array in the valley of Elah, some 16 miles south-west of Bethlehem; and David was sent by his father with provisions for his three brothers, who were then fighting on the side of the king. On his arrival in the camp of Israel, David (now about twenty years of age) was made aware of the state of matters when the champion of the Philistines, Goliath of Gath, came forth to defy Israel. David took his sling, and with a well-trained aim threw a stone “out of the brook,” which struck the giant’s forehead, so that he fell senseless to the ground. David then ran and slew him, and cut off his head with his own sword ([1 Sam. 17](/1sam#1Sam.17)). The result was a great victory to the Israelites, who pursued the Philistines to the gates of Gath and Ekron.

 David’s popularity consequent on this heroic exploit awakened Saul’s jealousy ([1 Sam. 18:6-16](/1sam#1Sam.18.6)), which he showed in various ways. He conceived a bitter hatred toward him, and by various stratagems sought his death ([1 Sam. 18](/1sam#1Sam.18)-30). The deep-laid plots of the enraged king, who could not fail to observe that David “prospered exceedingly,” all proved futile, and only endeared the young hero the more to the people, and very specially to Jonathan, Saul’s son, between whom and David a life-long warm friendship was formed.

 A fugitive. To escape from the vengeance of Saul, David fled to Ramah ([1 Sam. 19:12-18](/1sam#1Sam.19.12)) to Samuel, who received him, and he dwelt among the sons of the prophets, who were there under Samuel’s training. It is supposed by some that the sixth, seventh, and eleventh Psalms were composed by him at this time. This place was only 3 miles from the residence of Saul, who soon discovered whither the fugitive had gone, and tried ineffectually to bring him back. Jonathan made a fruitless effort to bring his father to a better state of mind toward David ([1 Sam. 20](/1sam#1Sam.20)), who, being made aware of the fact, saw no hope of safety but in flight to a distance. We accordingly find him first at Nob (21:1-9) and then at Gath, the chief city of the Philistines. The king of the Philistines would not admit him into his service, as he expected that he would, and David accordingly now betook himself to the stronghold of Adullam (22:1-4; [1 Chr. 12:8-18](/1chr#1Chr.12.8)). Here in a short time 400 men gathered around him and acknowledged him as their leader. It was at this time that David, amid the harassment and perils of his position, cried, “Oh that one would give me drink of the water of the well of Bethlehem;” when three of his heroes broke through the lines of the Philistines and brought him the water for which he longed ([2 Sam. 23:13-17](/2sam#2Sam.23.13)), but which he would not drink.

 In his rage at the failure of all his efforts to seize David, Saul gave orders for the massacre of the entire priestly family at Nob, “persons who wore a linen ephod”, to the number of eighty-five persons, who were put to death by Doeg the Edomite. The sad tidings of the massacre were brought to David by Abiathar, a son of Ahimelech, the only one who escaped. Comp. [Ps. 52](/ps#Ps.52).

 Hearing that Keilah, a town on the western frontier, was harassed by the Philistines, David with his men relieved it ([1 Sam. 23:1-14](/1sam#1Sam.23.1)); and then, for fear of Saul, he fled to the strongholds in the “hill country” of Judah. Comp. [Ps. 31](/ps#Ps.31). While encamped there, in the forest in the district of Ziph, he was visited by Jonathan, who spoke to him words of encouragement (23:16-18). The two now parted never to meet again. Saul continued his pursuit of David, who narrowly escaped from him at this time, and fled to the crags and ravines of Engedi, on the western shore of the Dead Sea ([1 Sam. 23:29](/1sam#1Sam.23.29)). Here Saul, who still pursued him with his army, narrowly escaped, through the generous forbearance of David, and was greatly affected by what David had done for him. He returned home from pursuing him, and David betook himself to Maon, where, with his 600 men, he maintained himself by contributions gathered from the district. Here occurred the incident connected with Nabal and his wife Abigail ([1 Sam. 25](/1sam#1Sam.25)), whom David married after Nabal’s death.

 Saul again went forth ([1 Sam. 26](/1sam#1Sam.26)) in pursuit of David, who had hid himself “in the hill Hachilah, which is before Jeshimon,” in the wilderness of Ziph, and was a second time spared through his forbearance. He returned home, professing shame and penitence for the way in which he had treated David, and predicting his elevation to the throne.

 Fighting against Israel. Harassed by the necessity of moving from place to place through fear of Saul, David once more sought refuge among the Philistines ([1 Sam. 27](/1sam#1Sam.27)). He was welcomed by the king, who assigned him Ziklag as his residence. Here David lived among his followers for some time as an independent chief engaged in frequent war with the Amalekites and other tribes on the south of Judah.

 Achish summoned David with his men to join his army against Saul; but the lords of the Philistines were suspicious of David’s loyalty, and therefore he was sent back to Ziklag, which he found to his dismay may had been pillaged and burnt during his brief absence. David pursued after the raiders, the Amalekites, and completely routed them. On his return to Ziklag tidings reached him of Saul’s death ([2 Sam. 1](/2sam#2Sam.1)). An Amalekite brought Saul’s crown and bracelet and laid them at his feet. David and his men rent their clothes and mourned for Saul, who had been defeated in battle near Mount Gilboa. David composed a beautiful elegy, the most beautiful of all extant Hebrew odes, a “lamentation over Saul and over Jonathan his son” ([2 Sam. 1:18-27](/2sam#2Sam.1.18)). It bore the title of “The Bow,” and was to be taught to the children, that the memory of Saul and Jonathan might be preserved among them. “Behold, it is written in the book of Jasher” (q.v.).

 David king over Judah. David and his men now set out for Hebron under divine direction ([2 Sam. 2:1-4](/2sam#2Sam.2.1)). There they were cordially welcomed, and he was at once anointed as king. He was now about thirty years of age.

 But his title to the throne was not undisputed. Abner took Ish-bosheth, Saul’s only remaining son, over the Jordan to Mahanaim, and there crowned him as king. Then began a civil war in Israel. The first encounter between the two opposing armies, led on the one side by Abner, and on the other by Joab, took place at the pool of Gibeon. It resulted in the defeat of Abner. Other encounters, however, between Israel and Judah followed ([2 Sam. 3:1](/2sam#2Sam.3.1), [5](/2sam#2Sam.3.5)), but still success was on the side of David. For the space of seven and a half years David reigned in Hebron. Abner now sided with David, and sought to promote his advancement; but was treacherously put to death by Joab in revenge for his having slain his brother Asahel at Gibeon (3:22-39). This was greatly to David’s regret. He mourned for the death of Abner. Shortly after this Ish-bosheth was also treacherously put to death by two Canaanites of Beeroth; and there being now no rival, David was anointed king over all Israel (4:1-12).

 David king over all Israel ([2 Sam. 5:1-5](/2sam#2Sam.5.1); [1 Chr. 11:1-3](/1chr#1Chr.11.1)). The elders of Israel now repaired to Hebron and offered allegiance to David in name of all the people, among whom the greatest enthusiasm prevailed. He was anointed king over all Israel, and sought out a new seat of government, more suitable than Hebron, as the capital of his empire. At this time there was a Jebusite fortress, “the stronghold”, on the hill of Zion, called also Jebus. This David took from the Jebusites, and made it Israel’s capital, and established here his residence, and afterwards built for himself a palace by the aid of Tyrian tradesmen. The Philistines, who had for some time observed a kind of truce, now made war against David; but were defeated in battle at a place afterwards called, in remembrance of the victory, Baal-perazim. Again they invaded the land, and were a second time routed by him. He thus delivered Israel from their enemies.

 David now resolved to bring up the ark of the covenant to his new capital ([2 Sam. 6](/2sam#2Sam.6)). It was in the house of Abinadab at Kirjath-jearim, about 7 miles from Jerusalem, where it had been for many years, from the time when the Philistines had sent it home ([1 Sam. 6](/1sam#1Sam.6); [7](/1sam#1Sam.7)). In consequence of the death of Uzzah (for it was a divine ordinance that only the Levites should handle the ark, [Num. 4](/num#Num.4)), who had put forth his hand to steady the ark when the cart in which it was being conveyed shook by reason of the roughness of the road, David stayed the procession, and conveyed the ark into the house of Obed-edom, a Philistine from Gath. After three months David brought the ark from the house of Obed-edom up to Jerusalem. Comp. [Ps. 24](/ps#Ps.24). Here it was placed in a new tent or tabernacle which David erected for the purpose. About seventy years had passed since it had stood in the tabernacle at Shiloh. The old tabernacle was now at Gibeah, at which Zadok ministered. David now ([1 Chr. 16](/1chr#1Chr.16)) carefully set in order all the ritual of divine worship at Jerusalem, along with Abiathar the high priest. A new religious era began. The service of praise was for the first time introduced into public worship. Zion became henceforth “God’s holy hill.”

 David’s wars. David now entered on a series of conquests which greatly extended and strengthened his kingdom ([2 Sam. 8](/2sam#2Sam.8)). In a few years the whole territory from the Euphrates to the river of Egypt, and from Gaza on the west to Thapsacus on the east, was under his sway ([2 Sam. 8:3-13](/2sam#2Sam.8.3); [10](/2sam#2Sam.10)).

 David’s fall. He had now reached the height of his glory. He ruled over a vast empire, and his capital was enriched with the spoils of many lands. But in the midst of all this success he fell, and his character became stained with the sin of adultery ([2 Sam. 11:2-27](/2sam#2Sam.11.2)). It has been noted as characteristic of the Bible that while his military triumphs are recorded in a few verses, the sad story of his fall is given in detail, a story full of warning, and therefore recorded. This crime, in the attempt to conceal it, led to anoter. He was guilty of murder. Uriah, whom he had foully wronged, an officer of the Gibborim, the corps of heros (23:39), was, by his order, “set in the front of the hottest battle” at the siege of Rabbah, in order that he might be put to death. Nathan the prophet ([2 Sam. 7:1-17](/2sam#2Sam.7.1); [12:1-23](/2sam#2Sam.12.1)) was sent by God to bring home his crimes to the conscience of the guilty monarch. He became a true penitent. He bitterly bewailed his sins before God. The thirty-second and fifty-first Psalms reveal the deep struggles of his soul, and his spiritual recovery.

 Bathsheba became his wife after Uriah’s death. Her first-born son died, according to the word of the prophet. She gave birth to a second son, whom David called Solomon, and who ultimately succeeded him on the throne ([2 Sam. 12:24](/2sam#2Sam.12.24), [25](/2sam#2Sam.12.25)).

 Peace. After the successful termination of all his wars, David formed the idea of building a temple for the ark of God. This he was not permitted to carry into execution, because he had been a man of war. God, however, sent Nathan to him with a gracious message ([2 Sam. 7:1-16](/2sam#2Sam.7.1)). On receiving it he went into the sanctuary, the tent where the ark was, and sat before the Lord, and poured out his heart in words of devout thanksgiving (18-29). The building of the temple was reserved for his son Solomon, who would be a man of peace ([1 Chr. 22:9](/1chr#1Chr.22.9); [28:3](/1chr#1Chr.28.3)).

 A cloudy evening. Hitherto David’s carrer had been one of great prosperity and success. Now cloudy and dark days came. His eldest son Amnon, whose mother was Ahinoam of Jezreel, was guilty of a great and shameful crime ([2 Sam. 13](/2sam#2Sam.13)). This was the beginning of the disasters of his later years. After two years Absalom terribly avenged the crime against Tamar, and put Amnon to death. This brought sore trouble to David’s heart. Absalom, afraid of the consequences of his guilt, fled to Geshur beyond Jordan, where he remained for three years, when he was brought back through the intrigue of Joab ([2 Sam. 14](/2sam#2Sam.14)).

 After this there fell upon the land the calamity of three years’ famine ([2 Sam. 21:1-14](/2sam#2Sam.21.1)). This was soon after followed by a pestilence, brought upon the land as a punishment for David’s sinful pride in numbering the people ([2 Sam. 24](/2sam#2Sam.24)), in which no fewer than 70,000 perished in the space of three days.

 Rebellion of Absalom. The personal respect for David was sadly lowered by the incident of Bathsheba. There was a strong popular sentiment against the taking of the census, and the outburst of the plague in connection with it deepened the feeling of jealously that had begun to manifest itself among some of the tribes against David. Absalom, taking full advantage of this state of things, gradually gained over the people, and at length openly rebelled against his father, and usurped the throne. Ahithophel was Absalom’s chief counsellor. The revolt began in Hebron, the capital of Judah. Absalom was there proclaimed king. David was now in imminent danger, and he left Jerusalem ([2 Sam. 15:13-20](/2sam#2Sam.15.13)), and once more became a fugitive. It was a momentous day in Israel. The incidents of it are recorded with a fulness of detail greater than of any other day in Old Testament history. David fled with his followers to Mahanarm, on the east of Jordan. An unnatural civil war broke out. After a few weeks the rival armies were mustered and organized. They met in hostile array at the wood of Ephraim ([2 Sam. 18:1-8](/2sam#2Sam.18.1)). Absalom’s army was defeated, and himself put to death by the hand of Joab (9-18). The tidings of the death of his rebellious son filled the heart of David with the most poignant grief. He “went up to the chamber over the gate, and wept” (33), giving utterance to the heart-broken cry, “Would God I had died for thee, O Absalom, my son, my son!” Peace was now restored, and David returned to Jerusalem and resumed the direction of affairs. An unhappy dispute arose between the men of Judah and the men of Israel (19:41-43). Sheba, a Benjamite, headed a revolt of the men of Israel. He was pursued to Abelbeth-maachah, and was there put to death, and so the revolt came to an end.

 The end. After the suppression of the rebellion of Absalom and that of Sheba, ten comparatively peaceful years of David’s life passed away. During those years he seems to have been principally engaged in accumulating treasures of every kind for the great temple at Jerusalem, which it was reserved to his successor to build ([1 Chr. 22](/1chr#1Chr.22); [28](/1chr#1Chr.28); [29](/1chr#1Chr.29)), a house which was to be “exceeding magnifical, of fame and of glory throughout all countries” (22:5). The exciting and laborious life he had spent, and the dangers and trials through which he had passed, had left him an enfeebled man, prematurely old. It became apparent that his life was now drawing to its close. A new palace conspiracy broke out as to who should be his successor. Joab favoured Adonijah. The chiefs of his party met at the “Fuller’s spring,” in the valley of Kidron, to proclaim him king; but Nathan hastened on a decision on the part of David in favour of Solomon, and so the aim of Adonijah’s party failed. Solomon was brought to Jerusalem, and was anointed king and seated on his father’s throne ([1 Kings 1:11-53](/1kgs#1Kgs.1.11)). David’s last words are a grand utterance, revealing his unfailing faith in God, and his joyful confidence in his gracious covenant promises ([2 Sam. 23:1-7](/2sam#2Sam.23.1)).

 After a reign of forty years and six months ([2 Sam. 5:5](/2sam#2Sam.5.5); [1 Chr. 3:4](/1chr#1Chr.3.4)) David died (B.C. 1015) at the age of seventy years, “and was buried in the city of David.” His tomb is still pointed out on Mount Zion.

 Both in his prophetical and in his regal character David was a type of the Messiah ([1 Sam. 16:13](/1sam#1Sam.16.13)). The book of Psalms commonly bears the title of the “Psalms of David,” from the circumstance that he was the largest contributor (about eighty psalms) to the collection.

 “The greatness of David was felt when he was gone. He had lived in harmony with both the priesthood and the prophets; a sure sign that the spirit of his government had been throughly loyal to the higher aims of the theocracy. The nation had not been oppressed by him, but had been left in the free enjoyment of its ancient liberties. As far as his power went he had striven to act justly to all ([2 Sam. 8:15](/2sam#2Sam.8.15)). His weak indulgence to his sons, and his own great sin besides, had been bitterly atoned, and were forgotten at his death in the remembrance of his long-tried worth. He had reigned thirty-three years in Jerusalem and seven and a half at Hebron ([2 Sam. 5:5](/2sam#2Sam.5.5)). Israel at his accession had reached the lowest point of national depression; its new-born unity rudely dissolved; its territory assailed by the Philistines. But he had left it an imperial power, with dominions like those of Egypt or Assyria. The sceptre of Solomon was already, before his father’s death, owned from the Mediterranean to the Euphrates, and from the Orontes to the Red Sea.”, Geikie’s Hours etc., iii.",0.0,person,david_994,david_994,

Day,1538,d-p89.4,Day,"The Jews reckoned the day from sunset to sunset ([Lev. 23:32](/lev#Lev.23.32)).

Before the Captivity the Jews divided the night into three watches, (1) from sunset to midnight ([Lam. 2:19](/lam#Lam.2.19)); (2) from midnight till the cock-crowing ([Judg. 7:19](/judg#Judg.7.19)); and (3) from the cock-crowing till sunrise ([Ex. 14:24](/exod#Exod.14.24)). In the New Testament the division of the Greeks and Romans into four watches was adopted ([Mark 13:35](/mark#Mark.13.35)).

 The division of the day by hours is first mentioned in [Dan. 3:6](/dan#Dan.3.6), [15](/dan#Dan.3.15); [4:19](/dan#Dan.4.19); [5:5](/dan#Dan.5.5). This mode of reckoning was borrowed from the Chaldeans. The reckoning of twelve hours was from sunrise to sunset, and accordingly the hours were of variable length ([John 11:9](/john#John.11.9)).

 The word “day” sometimes signifies an indefinite time ([Gen. 2:4](/gen#Gen.2.4); [Isa. 22:5](/isa#Isa.22.5); [Heb. 3:8](/heb#Heb.3.8), etc.).

Deacon,1543,d-p96.4,Deacon,"Anglicized form of the Greek word diaconos, meaning a “runner,” “messenger,” “servant.” For a long period a feeling of mutual jealousy had existed between the “Hebrews,” or Jews proper, who spoke the sacred language of palestine, and the “Hellenists,” or Jews of the Grecian speech, who had adopted the Grecian language, and read the Septuagint version of the Bible instead of the Hebrew. This jealousy early appeared in the Christian community. It was alleged by the Hellenists that their widows were overlooked in the daily distribution of alms. This spirit must be checked. The apostles accordingly advised the disciples to look out for seven men of good report, full of the Holy Ghost, and men of practical wisdom, who should take entire charge of this distribution, leaving them free to devote themselves entirely to the spiritual functions of their office ([Acts 6:1-6](/acts#Acts.6.1)). This was accordingly done. Seven men were chosen, who appear from their names to have been Hellenists. The name “deacon” is nowhere applied to them in the New Testament; they are simply called “the seven” (21:8). Their office was at first secular, but it afterwards became also spiritual; for among other qualifications they must also be “apt to teach” ([1 Tim. 3](/1tim#1Tim.3): 8-12).

Dead Sea,1545,d-p98.11,Dead Sea,"The name given by Greek writers of the second century to that inland sea called in Scripture the “salt sea” ([Gen. 14:3](/gen#Gen.14.3); [Num. 34:12](/num#Num.34.12)), the “sea of the plain” ([Deut. 3:17](/deut#Deut.3.17)), the “east sea” ([Ezek. 47:18](/ezek#Ezek.47.18); [Joel 2:20](/joel#Joel.2.20)), and simply “the sea” ([Ezek. 47:8](/ezek#Ezek.47.8)). The Arabs call it Bahr Lut, i.e., the Sea of Lot. It lies about 16 miles in a straight line to the east of Jerusalem. Its surface is 1,292 feet below the surface of the Mediterranean Sea. It covers an area of about 300 square miles. Its depth varies from 1,310 to 11 feet. From various phenomena that have been observed, its bottom appears to be still subsiding. It is about 53 miles long, and of an average breadth of 10 miles. It has no outlet, the great heat of that region causing such rapid evaporation that its average depth, notwithstanding the rivers that run into it, is maintained with little variation. The Jordan alone discharges into it no less than six million tons of water every twenty-four hours.

 The waters of the Dead Sea contain 24.6 per cent. of mineral salts, about seven times as much as in ordinary sea-water; thus they are unusually buoyant. Chloride of magnesium is most abundant; next to that chloride of sodium (common salt). But terraces of alluvial deposits in the deep valley of the Jordan show that formerly one great lake extended from the Waters of Merom to the foot of the watershed in the Arabah. The waters were then about 1,400 feet above the present level of the Dead Sea, or slightly above that of the Mediterranean, and at that time were much less salt.

 Nothing living can exist in this sea. “The fish carried down by the Jordan at once die, nor can even mussels or corals live in it; but it is a fable that no bird can fly over it, or that there are no living creatures on its banks. Dr. Tristram found on the shores three kinds of kingfishers, gulls, ducks, and grebes, which he says live on the fish which enter the sea in shoals, and presently die. He collected one hundred and eighteen species of birds, some new to science, on the shores, or swimming or flying over the waters. The cane-brakes which fringe it at some parts are the homes of about forty species of mammalia, several of them animals unknown in England; and innumerable tropical or semi-tropical plants perfume the atmosphere wherever fresh water can reach. The climate is perfect and most delicious, and indeed there is perhaps no place in the world where a sanatorium could be established with so much prospect of benefit as at Ain Jidi (Engedi).”, Geikie’s Hours, etc.",0.0,place,salt_sea_1021,,salt_sea_1021

 Death is the effect of sin ([Heb. 2:14](/heb#Heb.2.14)), and not a “debt of nature.” It is but once (9:27), universal ([Gen. 3:19](/gen#Gen.3.19)), necessary ([Luke 2:28-30](/luke#Luke.2.28)).

 The decrees of God are (1) efficacious, as they respect those events he has determined to bring about by his own immediate agency; or (2) permissive, as they respect those events he has determined that free agents shall be permitted by him to effect.

Deluge,1585,d-p147.4,Deluge,"The name given to Noah’s flood, the history of which is recorded in [Gen. 7](/gen#Gen.7) and 8.

 It began in the year 2516 B.C., and continued twelve lunar months and ten days, or exactly one solar year.

 The cause of this judgment was the corruption and violence that filled the earth in the ninth generation from Adam. God in righteous indignation determined to purge the earth of the ungodly race. Amid a world of crime and guilt there was one household that continued faithful and true to God, the household of Noah. “Noah was a just man and perfect in his generations.”

 At the command of God, Noah made an ark 300 cubits long, 50 broad, and 30 high. He slowly proceeded with this work during a period of one hundred and twenty years ([Gen. 6:3](/gen#Gen.6.3)). At length the purpose of God began to be carried into effect. The following table exhibits the order of events as they occurred:

 In the six hundredth year of his life Noah is commanded by God to enter the ark, taking with him his wife, and his three sons with their wives ([Gen. 7:1-10](/gen#Gen.7.1)).

 The rain begins on the seventeenth day of the second month ([Gen. 7:11-17](/gen#Gen.7.11)).

 The rain ceases, the waters prevail, fifteen cubits upward ([Gen. 7:18-24](/gen#Gen.7.18)).

 The ark grounds on one of the mountains of Ararat on the seventeenth day of the seventh month, or one hundred and fifty days after the Deluge began ([Gen. 8:1-4](/gen#Gen.8.1)).

 Tops of the mountains visible on the first day of the tenth month ([Gen. 8:5](/gen#Gen.8.5)).

 Raven and dove sent out forty days after this ([Gen. 8:6-9](/gen#Gen.8.6)).

 Dove again sent out seven days afterwards; and in the evening she returns with an olive leaf in her mouth ([Gen. 8:10](/gen#Gen.8.10), [11](/gen#Gen.8.11)).

 Dove sent out the third time after an interval of other seven days, and returns no more ([Gen. 8:12](/gen#Gen.8.12)).

 The ground becomes dry on the first day of the first month of the new year ([Gen. 8:13](/gen#Gen.8.13)).

 Noah leaves the ark on the twenty-seventh day of the second month ([Gen. 8:14-19](/gen#Gen.8.14)).

 The historical truth of the narrative of the Flood is established by the references made to it by our Lord ([Matt. 24:37](/matt#Matt.24.37); comp. [Luke 17:26](/luke#Luke.17.26)). Peter speaks of it also ([1 Pet. 3:20](/1pet#1Pet.3.20); 2 Pet. 2:5). In [Isa. 54:9](/isa#Isa.54.9) the Flood is referred to as “the waters of Noah.” The Biblical narrative clearly shows that so far as the human race was concerned the Deluge was universal; that it swept away all men living except Noah and his family, who were preserved in the ark; and that the present human race is descended from those who were thus preserved.

 Traditions of the Deluge are found among all the great divisions of the human family; and these traditions, taken as a whole, wonderfully agree with the Biblical narrative, and agree with it in such a way as to lead to the conclusion that the Biblical is the authentic narrative, of which all these traditions are more or less corrupted versions. The most remarkable of these traditions is that recorded on tablets prepared by order of Assur-bani-pal, the king of Assyria.

The same Hebrew word is rendered “wildernes,” and is used of the country lying between Egypt and Palestine ([Gen. 21:14](/gen#Gen.21.14), [21](/gen#Gen.21.21); [Ex. 4:27](/exod#Exod.4.27); [19:2](/exod#Exod.19.2); [Josh. 1:4](/josh#Josh.1.4)), the wilderness of the wanderings. It was a grazing tract, where the flocks and herds of the Israelites found pasturage during the whole of their journey to the Promised Land.

 The same Hebrew word is used also to denote the wilderness of Arabia, which in winter and early spring supplies good pasturage to the flocks of the nomad tribes than roam over it ([1 Kings 9:18](/1kgs#1Kgs.9.18)).

 The wilderness of Judah is the mountainous region along the western shore of the Dead Sea, where David fed his father’s flocks ([1 Sam. 17:28](/1sam#1Sam.17.28); [26:2](/1sam#1Sam.26.2)).

Deuteronomy,1605,d-p184.2,Deuteronomy,"In all the Hebrew manuscripts the Pentateuch (q.v.) forms one roll or volume divided into larger and smaller sections called parshioth_ and _sedarim. It is not easy to say when it was divided into five books. This was probably first done by the Greek translators of the book, whom the Vulgate follows. The fifth of these books was called by the Greeks Deuteronomion, i.e., the second law, hence our name Deuteronomy, or a second statement of the laws already promulgated. The Jews designated the book by the two first Hebrew words that occur, _’Elle haddabharim_, i.e., “These are the words.” They divided it into eleven parshioth. In the English Bible it contains thirty-four chapters.

 It consists chiefly of three discourses delivered by Moses a short time before his death. They were spoken to all Israel in the plains of Moab, in the eleventh month of the last year of their wanderings.

 The first discourse (1-4:40) recapitulates the chief events of the last forty years in the wilderness, with earnest exhortations to obedience to the divine ordinances, and warnings against the danger of forsaking the God of their fathers.

 The seond discourse (5-26:19) is in effect the body of the whole book. The first address is introductory to it. It contains practically a recapitulation of the law already given by God at Mount Sinai, together with many admonitions and injunctions as to the course of conduct they were to follow when they were settled in Canaan.

 The concluding discourse (ch. 27-30) relates almost wholly to the solemn sanctions of the law, the blessings to the obedient, and the curse that would fall on the rebellious. He solemnly adjures them to adhere faithfully to the covenant God had made with them, and so secure for themselves and their posterity the promised blessings.

 These addresses to the people are followed by what may be called three appendices, namely (1), a song which God had commanded Moses to write (32:1-47); (2) the blessings he pronounced on the separate tribes (ch. 33); and (3) the story of his death (32:48-52) and burial (ch. 34), written by some other hand, probably that of Joshua.

 These farewell addresses of Moses to the tribes of Israel he had so long led in the wilderness “glow in each line with the emotions of a great leader recounting to his contemporaries the marvellous story of their common experience. The enthusiasm they kindle, even to-day, though obscured by translation, reveals their matchless adaptation to the circumstances under which they were first spoken. Confidence for the future is evoked by remembrance of the past. The same God who had done mighty works for the tribes since the Exodus would cover their head in the day of battle with the nations of Palestine, soon to be invaded. Their great lawgiver stands before us, vigorous in his hoary age, stern in his abhorrence of evil, earnest in his zeal for God, but mellowed in all relations to earth by his nearness to heaven. The commanding wisdom of his enactments, the dignity of his position as the founder of the nation and the first of prophets, enforce his utterances. But he touches our deepest emotions by the human tenderness that breathes in all his words. Standing on the verge of life, he speaks as a father giving his parting counsels to those he loves; willing to depart and be with God he has served so well, but fondly lengthening out his last farewell to the dear ones of earth. No book can compare with Deuteronomy in its mingled sublimity and tenderness.” Geikie, Hours, etc.

 In [Lev. 17:7](/lev#Lev.17.7) the word “devil” is the translation of the Hebrew sair, meaning a “goat” or “satyr” ([Isa. 13:21](/isa#Isa.13.21); [34:14](/isa#Isa.34.14)), alluding to the wood-daemons, the objects of idolatrous worship among the heathen.

 In the narratives of the Gospels regarding the “casting out of devils” a different Greek word (daimon) is used. In the time of our Lord there were frequent cases of demoniacal possession ([Matt. 12:25-30](/matt#Matt.12.25); [Mark 5:1-20](/mark#Mark.5.1); [Luke 4:35](/luke#Luke.4.35); [10:18](/luke#Luke.10.18), etc.).",0.0,unmatched,unmatched,,
Dew,1612,d-p197.5,Dew,"“There is no dew properly so called in Palestine, for there is no moisture in the hot summer air to be chilled into dew-drops by the coldness of the night. From May till October rain is unknown, the sun shining with unclouded brightness day after day. The heat becomes intense, the ground hard, and vegetation would perish but for the moist west winds that come each night from the sea. The bright skies cause the heat of the day to radiate very quickly into space, so that the nights are as cold as the day is the reverse, a peculiarity of climate from which poor Jacob suffered thousands of years ago ([Gen. 31:40](/gen#Gen.31.40)). To this coldness of the night air the indispensable watering of all plant-life is due. The winds, loaded with moisture, are robbed of it as they pass over the land, the cold air condensing it into drops of water, which fall in a gracious rain of mist on every thirsty blade. In the morning the fog thus created rests like a sea over the plains, and far up the sides of the hills, which raise their heads above it like so many islands. At sunrise, however, the scene speedily changes. By the kindling light the mist is transformed into vast snow-white clouds, which presently break into separate masses and rise up the mountain-sides, to disappear in the blue above, dissipated by the increasing heat. These are ‘the morning clouds and the early dew that go away’ of which Hosea (6:4; 13:3) speaks so touchingly” (Geikie’s The Holy Land, etc., i., p. 72).

It is the symbol of a multitude ([2 Sam. 17:12](/2sam#2Sam.17.12); [Ps. 110:3](/ps#Ps.110.3)); and from its refreshing influence it is an emblem of brotherly love and harmony ([Ps. 133:3](/ps#Ps.133.3)), and of rich spiritual blessings ([Hos. 14:5](/hos#Hos.14.5)).",0.0,unmatched,unmatched,,

Three kinds of divination are mentioned in [Ezek. 21:21](/ezek#Ezek.21.21), by arrows, consulting with images (the teraphim), and by examining the entrails of animals sacrificed. The practice of this art seems to have been encouraged in ancient Egypt. Diviners also abounded among the aborigines of Canaan and the Philistines ([Isa. 2:6](/isa#Isa.2.6); [1 Sam. 28](/1sam#1Sam.28)). At a later period multitudes of magicians poured from Chaldea and Arabia into the land of Israel, and pursued their occupations ([Isa. 8:19](/isa#Isa.8.19); [2 Kings 21:6](/2kgs#2Kgs.21.6); [2 Chr. 33:6](/2chr#2Chr.33.6)). This superstition widely spread, and in the time of the apostles there were “vagabond Jews, exorcists” ([Acts 19:13](/acts#Acts.19.13)), and men like Simon Magus ([Acts 8:9](/acts#Acts.8.9)), Bar-jesus (13:6, 8), and other jugglers and impostors (19:19; [2 Tim. 3:13](/2tim#2Tim.3.13)).

Elijah’s dress was probably the skin of a sheep ([2 Kings 1:8](/2kgs#2Kgs.1.8)). The Hebrews were early acquainted with the art of weaving hair into cloth ([Ex. 26:7](/exod#Exod.26.7); [35:6](/exod#Exod.35.6)), which formed the sackcloth of mourners. This was the material of John the Baptist’s robe ([Matt. 3:4](/matt#Matt.3.4)). Wool was also woven into garments ([Lev. 13:47](/lev#Lev.13.47); [Deut. 22:11](/deut#Deut.22.11); [Ezek. 34:3](/ezek#Ezek.34.3); [Job 31:20](/job#Job.31.20); [Prov. 27:26](/prov#Prov.27.26)). The Israelites probably learned the art of weaving linen when they were in Egypt ([1 Chr. 4:21](/1chr#1Chr.4.21)). Fine linen was used in the vestments of the high priest ([Ex. 28:5](/exod#Exod.28.5)), as well as by the rich ([Gen. 41:42](/gen#Gen.41.42); [Prov. 31:22](/prov#Prov.31.22); [Luke 16:19](/luke#Luke.16.19)). The use of mixed material, as wool and flax, was forbidden ([Lev. 19:19](/lev#Lev.19.19); [Deut. 22:11](/deut#Deut.22.11)).",1.0,unmatched,unmatched,,
Dress 2,1684,d-p277.4,Dress,"Colour. The prevailing colour was the natural white of the material used, which was sometimes rendered purer by the fuller’s art ([Ps. 104:1](/ps#Ps.104.1), [2](/ps#Ps.104.2); [Isa. 63:3](/isa#Isa.63.3); [Mark 9:3](/mark#Mark.9.3)). The Hebrews were acquainted with the art of dyeing ([Gen. 37:3](/gen#Gen.37.3), [23](/gen#Gen.37.23)). Various modes of ornamentation were adopted in the process of weaving ([Ex. 28:6](/exod#Exod.28.6); [26:1](/exod#Exod.26.1), [31](/exod#Exod.26.31); [35:25](/exod#Exod.35.25)), and by needle-work ([Judg. 5:30](/judg#Judg.5.30); [Ps. 45:13](/ps#Ps.45.13)). Dyed robes were imported from foreign countries, particularly from Phoenicia ([Zeph. 1:8](/zeph#Zeph.1.8)). Purple and scarlet robes were the marks of the wealthy ([Luke 16:19](/luke#Luke.16.19); [2 Sam. 1:24](/2sam#2Sam.1.24)).",2.0,unmatched,unmatched,,
Dress 3,1685,d-p277.4,Dress,"Form. The robes of men and women were not very much different in form from each other.

 (a) The “coat” (kethoneth), of wool, cotton, or linen, was worn by both sexes. It was a closely-fitting garment, resembling in use and form our shirt ([John 19:23](/john#John.19.23)). It was kept close to the body by a girdle ([John 21:7](/john#John.21.7)). A person wearing this “coat” alone was described as naked ([1 Sam. 19:24](/1sam#1Sam.19.24); [Isa. 20:2](/isa#Isa.20.2); [2 Kings 6:30](/2kgs#2Kgs.6.30); [John 21:7](/john#John.21.7)); deprived of it he would be absolutely naked.

 (b) A linen cloth or wrapper (sadin) of fine linen, used somewhat as a night-shirt ([Mark 14:51](/mark#Mark.14.51)). It is mentioned in [Judg. 14:12](/judg#Judg.14.12), [13](/judg#Judg.14.13), and rendered there “sheets.”

 (c) An upper tunic (meil), longer than the “coat” ([1 Sam. 2:19](/1sam#1Sam.2.19); [24:4](/1sam#1Sam.24.4); [28:14](/1sam#1Sam.28.14)). In [1 Sam. 28:14](/1sam#1Sam.28.14) it is the mantle in which Samuel was enveloped; in [1 Sam. 24:4](/1sam#1Sam.24.4) it is the “robe” under which Saul slept. The disciples were forbidden to wear two “coats” ([Matt. 10:10](/matt#Matt.10.10); [Luke 9:3](/luke#Luke.9.3)).

 (d) The usual outer garment consisted of a piece of woollen cloth like a Scotch plaid, either wrapped round the body or thrown over the shoulders like a shawl, with the ends hanging down in front, or it might be thrown over the head so as to conceal the face ([2 Sam. 15:30](/2sam#2Sam.15.30); [Esther 6:12](/esth#Esth.6.12)). It was confined to the waist by a girdle, and the fold formed by the overlapping of the robe served as a pocket ([2 Kings 4:39](/2kgs#2Kgs.4.39); [Ps. 79:12](/ps#Ps.79.12); [Hag. 2:12](/hag#Hag.2.12); [Prov. 17:23](/prov#Prov.17.23); [21:14](/prov#Prov.21.14)).

 Female dress. The “coat” was common to both sexes ([Cant. 5:3](/song#Song.5.3)). But peculiar to females were (1) the “veil” or “wimple,” a kind of shawl ([Ruth 3:15](/ruth#Ruth.3.15); rendered “mantle,” R.V., [Isa. 3:22](/isa#Isa.3.22)); (2) the “mantle,” also a species of shawl ([Isa. 3:22](/isa#Isa.3.22)); (3) a “veil,” probably a light summer dress ([Gen. 24:65](/gen#Gen.24.65)); (4) a “stomacher,” a holiday dress ([Isa. 3:24](/isa#Isa.3.24)). The outer garment terminated in an ample fringe or border, which concealed the feet ([Isa. 47:2](/isa#Isa.47.2); [Jer. 13:22](/jer#Jer.13.22)).

 The dress of the Persians is described in [Dan. 3:21](/dan#Dan.3.21).

 The reference to the art of sewing are few, inasmuch as the garments generally came forth from the loom ready for being worn, and all that was required in the making of clothes devolved on the women of a family ([Prov. 31:22](/prov#Prov.31.22); [Acts 9:39](/acts#Acts.9.39)).

 Extravagance in dress is referred to in [Jer. 4:30](/jer#Jer.4.30); [Ezek. 16:10](/ezek#Ezek.16.10); [Zeph. 1:8](/zeph#Zeph.1.8) (R.V., “foreign apparel”); [1 Tim. 2:9](/1tim#1Tim.2.9); [1 Pet. 3:3](/1pet#1Pet.3.3). Rending the robes was expressive of grief ([Gen. 37:29](/gen#Gen.37.29), [34](/gen#Gen.37.34)), fear ([1 Kings 21:27](/1kgs#1Kgs.21.27)), indignation ([2 Kings 5:7](/2kgs#2Kgs.5.7)), or despair ([Judg. 11:35](/judg#Judg.11.35); [Esther 4:1](/esth#Esth.4.1)).

 Shaking the garments, or shaking the dust from off them, was a sign of renunciation ([Acts 18:6](/acts#Acts.18.6)); wrapping them round the head, of awe ([1 Kings 19:13](/1kgs#1Kgs.19.13)) or grief ([2 Sam. 15:30](/2sam#2Sam.15.30); casting them off, of excitement ([Acts 22:23](/acts#Acts.22.23)); laying hold of them, of supplication ([1 Sam. 15:27](/1sam#1Sam.15.27)). In the case of travelling, the outer garments were girded up ([1 Kings 18:46](/1kgs#1Kgs.18.46)). They were thrown aside also when they would impede action ([Mark 10:50](/mark#Mark.10.50); [John 13:4](/john#John.13.4); [Acts 7:58](/acts#Acts.7.58)).",3.0,unmatched,unmatched,,

 The Jews carefully strained their drinks through a sieve, through fear of violating the law of [Lev. 11:20](/lev#Lev.11.20), [23](/lev#Lev.11.23), [41](/lev#Lev.11.41), [42](/lev#Lev.11.42). (See [Matt. 23:24](/matt#Matt.23.24). “Strain at” should be “strain out.”)",0.0,unmatched,unmatched,,

In connection with it ([2 Kings 23:12](/2kgs#2Kgs.23.12)) was an upper room, used as a private chamber ([2 Sam 18:33](/2sam#2Sam.18.33); [Dan. 6:11](/dan#Dan.6.11)), also as a bedroom ([2 Kings 23:12](/2kgs#2Kgs.23.12)), a sleeping apartment for guests ([2 Kings 4:10](/2kgs#2Kgs.4.10)), and as a sick-chamber ([1 Kings 17:19](/1kgs#1Kgs.17.19)). The doors, sometimes of stone, swung on morticed pivots, and were generally fastened by wooden bolts. The houses of the more wealthy had a doorkeeper or a female porter ([John 18:16](/john#John.18.16); [Acts 12:13](/acts#Acts.12.13)). The windows generally opened into the courtyard, and were closed by a lattice ([Judg. 5:28](/judg#Judg.5.28)). The interior rooms were set apart for the female portion of the household.

 The furniture of the room ([2 Kings 4:10](/2kgs#2Kgs.4.10)) consisted of a couch furnished with pillows ([Amos 6:4](/amos#Amos.6.4); [Ezek. 13:20](/ezek#Ezek.13.20)); and besides this, chairs, a table and lanterns or lamp-stands ([2 Kings 4:10](/2kgs#2Kgs.4.10)).",0.0,unmatched,unmatched,,
Dye,1711,d-p322.5,Dye,"The art of dyeing is one of great antiquity, although no special mention is made of it in the Old Testament. The Hebrews probably learned it from the Egyptians (see [Ex. 26:1](/exod#Exod.26.1); [28:5-8](/exod#Exod.28.5)), who brought it to great perfection.

Eagle,1712,e-p0.2,Eagle,"(Herb. nesher; properly the griffon vulture or great vulture, so called from its tearing its prey with its beak), referred to for its swiftness of flight ([Deut. 28:49](/deut#Deut.28.49); [2 Sam. 1:23](/2sam#2Sam.1.23)), its mounting high in the air ([Job 39:27](/job#Job.39.27)), its strength ([Ps. 103:5](/ps#Ps.103.5)), its setting its nest in high places ([Jer. 49:16](/jer#Jer.49.16)), and its power of vision ([Job 39:27-30](/job#Job.39.27)).

 This “ravenous bird” is a symbol of those nations whom God employs and sends forth to do a work of destruction, sweeping away whatever is decaying and putrescent ([Matt. 24:28](/matt#Matt.24.28); [Isa. 46:11](/isa#Isa.46.11); [Ezek. 39:4](/ezek#Ezek.39.4); [Deut. 28:49](/deut#Deut.28.49); [Jer. 4:13](/jer#Jer.4.13); [48:40](/jer#Jer.48.40)). It is said that the eagle sheds his feathers in the beginning of spring, and with fresh plumage assumes the appearance of youth. To this, allusion is made in [Ps. 103:5](/ps#Ps.103.5) and [Isa. 40:31](/isa#Isa.40.31). God’s care over his people is likened to that of the eagle in training its young to fly ([Ex. 19:4](/exod#Exod.19.4); [Deut. 32:11](/deut#Deut.32.11), [12](/deut#Deut.32.12)). An interesting illustration is thus recorded by Sir Humphry Davy:, “I once saw a very interesting sight above the crags of Ben Nevis. Two parent eagles were teaching their offspring, two young birds, the maneuvers of flight. They began by rising from the top of the mountain in the eye of the sun. It was about mid-day, and bright for the climate. They at first made small circles, and the young birds imitated them. They paused on their wings, waiting till they had made their flight, and then took a second and larger gyration, always rising toward the sun, and enlarging their circle of flight so as to make a gradually ascending spiral. The young ones still and slowly followed, apparently flying better as they mounted; and they continued this sublime exercise, always rising till they became mere points in the air, and the young ones were lost, and afterwards their parents, to our aching sight.” (See [Isa. 40:31](/isa#Isa.40.31).)

 There have been observed in Palestine four distinct species of eagles, (1) the golden eagle (Aquila chrysaetos); (2) the spotted eagle (Aquila naevia); (3) the common species, the imperial eagle (Aquila heliaca); and (4) the Circaetos gallicus, which preys on reptiles. The eagle was unclean by the Levitical law ([Lev. 11:13](/lev#Lev.11.13); [Deut. 14:12](/deut#Deut.14.12)).",0.0,unmatched,unmatched,,

To have the “ear heavy”, or to have “uncircumcised ears” ([Isa. 6:10](/isa#Isa.6.10)), is to be inattentive and disobedient.

The word thus rendered is the same as that rendered “pledge” in [Gen. 38:17-20](/gen#Gen.38.17); “indeed, the Hebrew word has simply passed into the Greek and Latin languages, probably through commercial dealings with the Phoenicians, the great trading people of ancient days. Originally it meant no more than a pledge; but in common usage it came to denote that particular kind of pledge which is a part of the full price of an article paid in advance; and as it is joined with the figure of a seal when applied to the Spirit, it seems to be used by Paul in this specific sense.” The Spirit’s gracious presence and working in believers is a foretaste to them of the blessedness of heaven.

Edom 2,1757,e-p46.3,Edom,"Idumea ([Isa. 34:5](/isa#Isa.34.5), [6](/isa#Isa.34.6); [Ezek. 35:15](/ezek#Ezek.35.15)). “The field of Edom” ([Gen. 32:3](/gen#Gen.32.3)), “the land of Edom” ([Gen. 36:16](/gen#Gen.36.16)), was mountainous (Obad. 1:8, 9, 19, 21). It was called the land, or “the mountain of Seir,” the rough hills on the east side of the Arabah. It extended from the head of the Gulf of Akabah, the Elanitic gulf, to the foot of the Dead Sea ([1 Kings 9:26](/1kgs#1Kgs.9.26)), and contained, among other cities, the rock-hewn Sela (q.v.), generally known by the Greek name Petra ([2 Kings 14:7](/2kgs#2Kgs.14.7)). It is a wild and rugged region, traversed by fruitful valleys. Its old capital was Bozrah ([Isa. 63:1](/isa#Isa.63.1)). The early inhabitants of the land were Horites. They were destroyed by the Edomites ([Deut. 2:12](/deut#Deut.2.12)), between whom and the kings of Israel and Judah there was frequent war ([2 Kings 8:20](/2kgs#2Kgs.8.20); [2 Chr. 28:17](/2chr#2Chr.28.17)).

 At the time of the Exodus they churlishly refused permission to the Israelites to pass through their land ([Num. 20:14-21](/num#Num.20.14)), and ever afterwards maintained an attitude of hostility toward them. They were conquered by David ([2 Sam. 8:14](/2sam#2Sam.8.14); comp. [1 Kings 9:26](/1kgs#1Kgs.9.26)), and afterwards by Amaziah ([2 Chr. 25:11](/2chr#2Chr.25.11), [12](/2chr#2Chr.25.12)). But they regained again their independence, and in later years, during the decline of the Jewish kingdom ([2 Kings 16:6](/2kgs#2Kgs.16.6); R.V. marg., “Edomites”), made war against Israel. They took part with the Chaldeans when Nebuchadnezzar captured Jerusalem, and afterwards they invaded and held possession of the south of Palestine as far as Hebron. At length, however, Edom fell under the growing Chaldean power ([Jer. 27:3](/jer#Jer.27.3), [6](/jer#Jer.27.6)).

 There are many prophecies concerning Edom ([Isa. 34:5](/isa#Isa.34.5), [6](/isa#Isa.34.6); [Jer. 49:7-18](/jer#Jer.49.7); [Ezek. 25:13](/ezek#Ezek.25.13); [35:1-15](/ezek#Ezek.35.1); [Joel 3:19](/joel#Joel.3.19); [Amos 1:11](/amos#Amos.1.11); Obad.; [Mal. 1:3](/mal#Mal.1.3), [4](/mal#Mal.1.4)) which have been remarkably fulfilled. The present desolate condition of that land is a standing testimony to the inspiration of these prophecies. After an existence as a people for above seventeen hundred years, they have utterly disappeared, and their language even is forgotten for ever. In Petra, “where kings kept their court, and where nobles assembled, there no man dwells; it is given by lot to birds, and beasts, and reptiles.”

 The Edomites were Semites, closely related in blood and in language to the Israelites. They dispossessed the Horites of Mount Seir; though it is clear, from [Gen. 36](/gen#Gen.36), that they afterwards intermarried with the conquered population. Edomite tribes settled also in the south of Judah, like the Kenizzites ([Gen. 36:11](/gen#Gen.36.11)), to whom Caleb and Othniel belonged ([Josh. 15:17](/josh#Josh.15.17)).

It subsequently belonged to Manasseh, for a short time apparently, and afterwards became the abode of banditti and outlaws ([Josh. 13:31](/josh#Josh.13.31)). It has been identified with the modern Edr’a, which stands on a rocky promontory on the south-west edge of the Lejah (the Argob of the Hebrews, and Trachonitis of the Greeks). The ruins of Edr’a are the most extensive in the Hauran. They are 3 miles in circumference. A number of the ancient houses still remain; the walls, roofs, and doors being all of stone. The wild region of which Edrei was the capital is thus described in its modern aspect: “Elevated about 20 feet above the plain, it is a labyrinth of clefts and crevasses in the rock, formed by volcanic action; and owing to its impenetrable condition, it has become a refuge for outlaws and turbulent characters, who make it a sort of Cave of Adullam...It is, in fact, an impregnable natural fortress, about 20 miles in length and 15 in breadth” (Porter’s Syria, etc.).

Egypt,1769,e-p60.3,Egypt,"The land of the Nile and the pyramids, the oldest kingdom of which we have any record, holds a place of great significance in Scripture.

 The Egyptians belonged to the white race, and their original home is still a matter of dispute. Many scholars believe that it was in Southern Arabia, and recent excavations have shown that the valley of the Nile was originally inhabited by a low-class population, perhaps belonging to the Nigritian stock, before the Egyptians of history entered it. The ancient Egyptian language, of which the latest form is Coptic, is distantly connected with the Semitic family of speech.

 Egypt consists geographically of two halves, the northern being the Delta, and the southern Upper Egypt, between Cairo and the First Cataract. In the Old Testament, Northern or Lower Egypt is called Mazor, “the fortified land” ([Isa. 19:6](/isa#Isa.19.6); [37](/isa#Isa.37): 25, where the A.V. mistranslates “defence” and “besieged places”); while Southern or Upper Egypt is Pathros, the Egyptian Pa-to-Res, or “the land of the south” ([Isa. 11:11](/isa#Isa.11.11)). But the whole country is generally mentioned under the dual name of Mizraim, “the two Mazors.”

 The civilization of Egypt goes back to a very remote antiquity. The two kingdoms of the north and south were united by Menes, the founder of the first historical dynasty of kings. The first six dynasties constitute what is known as the Old Empire, which had its capital at Memphis, south of Cairo, called in the Old Testament Moph ([Hos. 9:6](/hos#Hos.9.6)) and Noph. The native name was Mennofer, “the good place.”

 The Pyramids were tombs of the monarchs of the Old Empire, those of Gizeh being erected in the time of the Fourth Dynasty. After the fall of the Old Empire came a period of decline and obscurity. This was followed by the Middle Empire, the most powerful dynasty of which was the Twelfth. The Fayyum was rescued for agriculture by the kings of the Twelfth Dynasty; and two obelisks were erected in front of the temple of the sun-god at On or Heliopolis (near Cairo), one of which is still standing. The capital of the Middle Empire was Thebes, in Upper Egypt.

 The Middle Empire was overthrown by the invasion of the Hyksos, or shepherd princes from Asia, who ruled over Egypt, more especially in the north, for several centuries, and of whom there were three dynasties of kings. They had their capital at Zoan or Tanis (now San), in the north-eastern part of the Delta. It was in the time of the Hyksos that Abraham, Jacob, and Joseph entered Egypt. The Hyksos were finally expelled about B.C. 1600, by the hereditary princes of Thebes, who founded the Eighteenth Dynasty, and carried the war into Asia. Canaan and Syria were subdued, as well as Cyprus, and the boundaries of the Egyptian Empire were fixed at the Euphrates. The Soudan, which had been conquered by the kings of the Twelfth Dynasty, was again annexed to Egypt, and the eldest son of the Pharaoh took the title of “Prince of Cush.”

 One of the later kings of the dynasty, Amenophis IV., or Khu-n-Aten, endeavoured to supplant the ancient state religion of Egypt by a new faith derived from Asia, which was a sort of pantheistic monotheism, the one supreme god being adored under the image of the solar disk. The attempt led to religious and civil war, and the Pharaoh retreated from Thebes to Central Egypt, where he built a new capital, on the site of the present Tell-el-Amarna. The cuneiform tablets that have been found there represent his foreign correspondence (about B.C. 1400). He surrounded himself with officials and courtiers of Asiatic, and more especially Canaanitish, extraction; but the native party succeeded eventually in overthrowing the government, the capital of Khu-n-Aten was destroyed, and the foreigners were driven out of the country, those that remained being reduced to serfdom.

 The national triumph was marked by the rise of the Nineteenth Dynasty, in the founder of which, Rameses I., we must see the “new king, who knew not Joseph.” His grandson, Rameses II., reigned sixty-seven years (B.C. 1348-1281), and was an indefatigable builder. As Pithom, excavated by Dr. Naville in 1883, was one of the cities he built, he must have been the Pharaoh of the Oppression. The Pharaoh of the Exodus may have been one of his immediate successors, whose reigns were short. Under them Egypt lost its empire in Asia, and was itself attacked by barbarians from Libya and the north.

 The Nineteenth Dynasty soon afterwards came to an end; Egypt was distracted by civil war; and for a short time a Canaanite, Arisu, ruled over it.

 Then came the Twentieth Dynasty, the second Pharaoh of which, Rameses III., restored the power of his country. In one of his campaigns he overran the southern part of Palestine, where the Israelites had not yet settled. They must at the time have been still in the wilderness. But it was during the reign of Rameses III. that Egypt finally lost Gaza and the adjoining cities, which were seized by the Pulista, or Philistines.

 After Rameses III., Egypt fell into decay. Solomon married the daughter of one of the last kings of the Twenty-first Dynasty, which was overthrown by Shishak I., the general of the Libyan mercenaries, who founded the Twenty-second Dynasty ([1 Kings 11:40](/1kgs#1Kgs.11.40); [14:25](/1kgs#1Kgs.14.25), [26](/1kgs#1Kgs.14.26)). A list of the places he captured in Palestine is engraved on the outside of the south wall of the temple of Karnak.

 In the time of Hezekiah, Egypt was conquered by Ethiopians from the Soudan, who constituted the Twenty-fifth Dynasty. The third of them was Tirhakah ([2 Kings 19:9](/2kgs#2Kgs.19.9)). In B.C. 674 it was conquered by the Assyrians, who divided it into twenty satrapies, and Tirhakah was driven back to his ancestral dominions. Fourteen years later it successfully revolted under Psammetichus I. of Sais, the founder of the Twenty-sixth Dynasty. Among his successors were Necho ([2 Kings 23:29](/2kgs#2Kgs.23.29)) and Hophra, or Apries ([Jer. 37:5](/jer#Jer.37.5), [7](/jer#Jer.37.7), [11](/jer#Jer.37.11)). The dynasty came to an end in B.C. 525, when the country was subjugated by Cambyses. Soon afterwards it was organized into a Persian satrapy.

 The title of Pharaoh, given to the Egyptian kings, is the Egyptian Per-aa, or “Great House,” which may be compared to that of “Sublime Porte.” It is found in very early Egyptian texts.

 The Egyptian religion was a strange mixture of pantheism and animal worship, the gods being adored in the form of animals. While the educated classes resolved their manifold deities into manifestations of one omnipresent and omnipotent divine power, the lower classes regarded the animals as incarnations of the gods.

 Under the Old Empire, Ptah, the Creator, the god of Memphis, was at the head of the Pantheon; afterwards Amon, the god of Thebes, took his place. Amon, like most of the other gods, was identified with Ra, the sun-god of Heliopolis.

 The Egyptians believed in a resurrection and future life, as well as in a state of rewards and punishments dependent on our conduct in this world. The judge of the dead was Osiris, who had been slain by Set, the representative of evil, and afterwards restored to life. His death was avenged by his son Horus, whom the Egyptians invoked as their “Redeemer.” Osiris and Horus, along with Isis, formed a trinity, who were regarded as representing the sun-god under different forms.

 Even in the time of Abraham, Egypt was a flourishing and settled monarchy. Its oldest capital, within the historic period, was Memphis, the ruins of which may still be seen near the Pyramids and the Sphinx. When the Old Empire of Menes came to an end, the seat of empire was shifted to Thebes, some 300 miles farther up the Nile. A short time after that, the Delta was conquered by the Hyksos, or shepherd kings, who fixed their capital at Zoan, the Greek Tanis, now San, on the Tanic arm of the Nile. All this occurred before the time of the new king “which knew not Joseph” ([Ex. 1:8](/exod#Exod.1.8)). In later times Egypt was conquered by the Persians (B.C. 525), and by the Greeks under Alexander the Great (B.C. 332), after whom the Ptolemies ruled the country for three centuries. Subsequently it was for a time a province of the Roman Empire; and at last, in A.D. 1517, it fell into the hands of the Turks, of whose empire it still forms nominally a part. Abraham and Sarah went to Egypt in the time of the shepherd kings. The exile of Joseph and the migration of Jacob to “the land of Goshen” occurred about 200 years later. On the death of Solomon, Shishak, king of Egypt, invaded Palestine ([1 Kings 14:25](/1kgs#1Kgs.14.25)). He left a list of the cities he conquered.

 A number of remarkable clay tablets, discovered at Tell-el-Amarna in Upper Egypt, are the most important historical records ever found in connection with the Bible. They most fully confirm the historical statements of the Book of Joshua, and prove the antiquity of civilization in Syria and Palestine. As the clay in different parts of Palestine differs, it has been found possible by the clay alone to decide where the tablets come from when the name of the writer is lost. The inscriptions are cuneiform, and in the Aramaic language, resembling Assyrian. The writers are Phoenicians, Amorites, and Philistines, but in no instance Hittites, though Hittites are mentioned. The tablets consist of official dispatches and letters, dating from B.C. 1480, addressed to the two Pharaohs, Amenophis III. and IV., the last of this dynasty, from the kings and governors of Phoenicia and Palestine. There occur the names of three kings killed by Joshua, Adoni-zedec, king of Jerusalem, Japhia, king of Lachish ([Josh. 10:3](/josh#Josh.10.3)), and Jabin, king of Hazor (11:1); also the Hebrews (Abiri) are said to have come from the desert.

 The principal prophecies of Scripture regarding Egypt are these, [Isa. 19](/isa#Isa.19); [Jer. 43](/jer#Jer.43): 8-13; 44:30; 46; [Ezek. 29](/ezek#Ezek.29)-32; and it might be easily shown that they have all been remarkably fulfilled. For example, the singular disappearance of Noph (i.e., Memphis) is a fulfilment of [Jer. 46:19](/jer#Jer.46.19), [Ezek. 30:13](/ezek#Ezek.30.13).",0.0,place,egypt_362,,"egypt_362,egypt_259"

Elder,1788,e-p98.6,Elder,"A name frequently used in the Old Testament as denoting a person clothed with authority, and entitled to respect and reverence ([Gen. 50:7](/gen#Gen.50.7)). It also denoted a political office ([Num. 22:7](/num#Num.22.7)). The “elders of Israel” held a rank among the people indicative of authority. Moses opened his commission to them ([Ex. 3:16](/exod#Exod.3.16)). They attended Moses on all important occasions. Seventy of them attended on him at the giving of the law ([Ex. 24:1](/exod#Exod.24.1)). Seventy also were selected from the whole number to bear with Moses the burden of the people ([Num. 11:16](/num#Num.11.16), [17](/num#Num.11.17)). The “elder” is the keystone of the social and political fabric wherever the patriarchal system exists. At the present day this is the case among the Arabs, where the sheik (i.e., “the old man”) is the highest authority in the tribe. The body of the “elders” of Israel were the representatives of the people from the very first, and were recognized as such by Moses. All down through the history of the Jews we find mention made of the elders as exercising authority among the people. They appear as governors ([Deut. 31:28](/deut#Deut.31.28)), as local magistrates (16:18), administering justice (19:12). They were men of extensive influence ([1 Sam. 30:26-31](/1sam#1Sam.30.26)). In New Testament times they also appear taking an active part in public affairs ([Matt. 16:21](/matt#Matt.16.21); [21:23](/matt#Matt.21.23); [26:59](/matt#Matt.26.59)).

 The Jewish eldership was transferred from the old dispensation to the new. “The creation of the office of elder is nowhere recorded in the New Testament, as in the case of deacons and apostles, because the latter offices were created to meet new and special emergencies, while the former was transmitted from the earlies times. In other words, the office of elder was the only permanent essential office of the church under either dispensation.”

 The “elders” of the New Testament church were the “pastors” ([Eph. 4:11](/eph#Eph.4.11)), “bishops or overseers” ([Acts 20:28](/acts#Acts.20.28)), “leaders” and “rulers” ([Heb. 13:7](/heb#Heb.13.7); [1 Thess. 5:12](/1thess#1Thess.5.12)) of the flock. Everywhere in the New Testament bishop and presbyter are titles given to one and the same officer of the Christian church. He who is called presbyter or elder on account of his age or gravity is also called bishop or overseer with reference to the duty that lay upon him ([Titus 1:5-7](/titus#Titus.1.5); [Acts 20:17-28](/acts#Acts.20.17); [Phil. 1:1](/phil#Phil.1.1)).",0.0,unmatched,unmatched,,

On Mount Hor he was clothed with the sacred vestments, which Moses took from off his brother Aaron and put upon him as successor to his father in the high priest’s office, which he held for more than twenty years ([Num. 20:25-29](/num#Num.20.25)). He took part with Moses in numbering the people (26:3, 4), and assisted at the inauguration of Joshua. He assisted in the distribution of the land after the conquest ([Josh. 14:1](/josh#Josh.14.1)). The high-priesthood remained in his family till the time of Eli, into whose family it passed, till it was restored to the family of Eleazar in the person of Zadok ([1 Sam. 2:35](/1sam#1Sam.2.35); comp.

Election of Grace,1796,e-p107.3,Election of Grace,"The Scripture speaks (1) of the election of individuals to office or to honour and privilege, e.g., Abraham, Jacob, Saul, David, Solomon, were all chosen by God for the positions they held; so also were the apostles. (2) There is also an election of nations to special privileges, e.g., the Hebrews ([Deut. 7:6](/deut#Deut.7.6); [Rom. 9:4](/rom#Rom.9.4)). (3) But in addition there is an election of individuals to eternal life ([2 Thess. 2:13](/2thess#2Thess.2.13); [Eph. 1:4](/eph#Eph.1.4); [1 Pet. 1:2](/1pet#1Pet.1.2); [John 13:18](/john#John.13.18)).

 The ground of this election to salvation is the good pleasure of God ([Eph. 1:5](/eph#Eph.1.5), [11](/eph#Eph.1.11); [Matt. 11:25](/matt#Matt.11.25), [26](/matt#Matt.11.26); [John 15:16](/john#John.15.16), [19](/john#John.15.19)). God claims the right so to do ([Rom. 9:16](/rom#Rom.9.16), [21](/rom#Rom.9.21)).

 It is not conditioned on faith or repentance, but is of soverign grace ([Rom. 11:4-6](/rom#Rom.11.4); [Eph. 1:3-6](/eph#Eph.1.3)). All that pertain to salvation, the means ([Eph. 2:8](/eph#Eph.2.8); [2 Thess. 2:13](/2thess#2Thess.2.13)) as well as the end, are of God ([Acts 5:31](/acts#Acts.5.31); [2 Tim. 2:25](/2tim#2Tim.2.25); [1 Cor. 1:30](/1cor#1Cor.1.30); [Eph. 2:5](/eph#Eph.2.5), [10](/eph#Eph.2.10)). Faith and repentance and all other graces are the exercises of a regenerated soul; and regeneration is God’s work, a “new creature.”

He was the first of the line of Ithamar, Aaron’s fourth son ([1 Chr. 24:3](/1chr#1Chr.24.3); comp. [2 Sam. 8:17](/2sam#2Sam.8.17)), who held that office. The office remained in his family till the time of Abiathar ([1 Kings 2:26](/1kgs#1Kgs.2.26), [27](/1kgs#1Kgs.2.27)), whom Solomon deposed, and appointed Zadok, of the family of Eleazar, in his stead (35). He acted also as a civil judge in Israel after the death of Samson ([1 Sam. 4:18](/1sam#1Sam.4.18)), and judged Israel for forty years.

 His sons Hophni and Phinehas grossly misconducted themselves, to the great disgust of the people ([1 Sam. 2:27-36](/1sam#1Sam.2.27)). They were licentious reprobates. He failed to reprove them so sternly as he ought to have done, and so brought upon his house the judgment of God (2:22-33; 3:18). The Israelites proclaimed war against the Philistines, whose army was encamped at Aphek. The battle, fought a short way beyond Mizpeh, ended in the total defeat of Israel. Four thousand of them fell in “battle array”. They now sought safety in having the “ark of the covenant of the Lord” among them. They fetched it from Shiloh, and Hophni and Phinehas accompanied it. This was the first time since the settlement of Israel in Canaan that the ark had been removed from the sanctuary. The Philistines put themselves again in array against Israel, and in the battle which ensued “Israel was smitten, and there was a very great slaughter.” The tidings of this great disaster were speedily conveyed to Shiloh, about 20 miles distant, by a messenger, a Benjamite from the army. There Eli sat outside the gate of the sanctuary by the wayside, anxiously waiting for tidings from the battle-field. The full extent of the national calamity was speedily made known to him: “Israel is fled before the Philistines, there has also been a great slaughter among the people, thy two sons Hophni and Phinehas are dead, and the ark of God is taken” ([1 Sam. 4:12-18](/1sam#1Sam.4.12)). When the old man, whose eyes were “stiffened” (i.e., fixed, as of a blind eye unaffected by the light) with age, heard this sad story of woe, he fell backward from off his seat and died, being ninety and eight years old.

Elijah,1844,e-p151.2,Elijah,"
Whose God is Jehovah. ",0.0,unmatched,unmatched,,
Elijah 1,1845,e-p151.2,Elijah,"“The Tishbite,” the “Elias” of the New Testament, is suddenly introduced to our notice in [1 Kings 17:1](/1kgs#1Kgs.17.1) as delivering a message from the Lord to Ahab. There is mention made of a town called Thisbe, south of Kadesh, but it is impossible to say whether this was the place referred to in the name given to the prophet.

 Having delivered his message to Ahab, he retired at the command of God to a hiding-place by the brook Cherith, beyond Jordan, where he was fed by ravens. When the brook dried up God sent him to the widow of Zarephath, a city of Zidon, from whose scanty store he was supported for the space of two years. During this period the widow’s son died, and was restored to life by Elijah ([1 Kings 17](/1kgs#1Kgs.17): 2-24).

 During all these two years a famine prevailed in the land. At the close of this period of retirement and of preparation for his work (comp. [Gal. 1:17](/gal#Gal.1.17), [18](/gal#Gal.1.18)) Elijah met Obadiah, one of Ahab’s officers, whom he had sent out to seek for pasturage for the cattle, and bade him go and tell his master that Elijah was there. The king came and met Elijah, and reproached him as the troubler of Israel. It was then proposed that sacrifices should be publicly offered, for the purpose of determining whether Baal or Jehovah were the true God. This was done on Carmel, with the result that the people fell on their faces, crying, “The Lord, he is the God.” Thus was accomplished the great work of Elijah’s ministry. The prophets of Baal were then put to death by the order of Elijah. Not one of them escaped. Then immediately followed rain, according to the word of Elijah, and in answer to his prayer ([James 5:18](/jas#Jas.5.18)).

 Jezebel, enraged at the fate that had befallen her priests of Baal, threatened to put Elijah to death ([1 Kings 19:1-13](/1kgs#1Kgs.19.1)). He therefore fled in alarm to Beersheba, and thence went alone a day’s journey into the wilderness, and sat down in despondency under a juniper tree. As he slept an angel touched him, and said unto him, “Arise and eat; because the journey is too great for thee.” He arose and found a cake and a cruse of water. Having partaken of the provision thus miraculously supplied, he went forward on his solitary way for forty days and forty nights to Horeb, the mount of God, where he took up his abode in a cave. Here the Lord appeared unto him and said, “What dost thou here, Elijah?” In answer to his despondent words God manifests to him his glory, and then directs him to return to Damascus and anoint Hazael king over Syria, and Jehu king over Israel, and Elisha to be prophet in his room ([1 Kings 19:13-21](/1kgs#1Kgs.19.13); comp. [2 Kings 8:7-15](/2kgs#2Kgs.8.7); [9:1-10](/2kgs#2Kgs.9.1)).

 Some six years after this he warned Ahab and Jezebel of the violent deaths they would die ([1 Kings 21:19-24](/1kgs#1Kgs.21.19); [22:38](/1kgs#1Kgs.22.38)). He also, four years afterwards, warned Ahaziah (q.v.), who had succeeded his father Ahab, of his approaching death ([2 Kings 1:1-16](/2kgs#2Kgs.1.1)). During these intervals he probably withdrew to some quiet retirement, no one knew where. His interview with Ahaziah’s messengers on the way to Ekron, and the account of the destruction of his captains with their fifties, suggest the idea that he may have been in retirement at this time on Mount Carmel.

 The time now drew near when he was to be taken up into heaven ([2 Kings 2:1-12](/2kgs#2Kgs.2.1)). He had a presentiment of what was awaiting him. He went down to Gilgal, where was a school of the prophets, and where his successor Elisha, whom he had anointed some years before, resided. Elisha was solemnized by the thought of his master’s leaving him, and refused to be parted from him. “They two went on,” and came to Bethel and Jericho, and crossed the Jordan, the waters of which were “divided hither and thither” when smitten with Elijah’s mantle. Arrived at the borders of Gilead, which Elijah had left many years before, it “came to pass as they still went on and talked” they were suddenly separated by a chariot and horses of fire; and “Elijah went up by a whirlwind into heaven, “Elisha receiving his mantle, which fell from him as he ascended.

 No one of the old prophets is so frequently referred to in the New Testament. The priests and Levites said to the Baptist ([John 1:25](/john#John.1.25)), “Why baptizest thou, if thou be not that Christ, nor Elias?” Paul ([Rom. 11:2](/rom#Rom.11.2)) refers to an incident in his history to illustrate his argument that God had not cast away his people. James (5:17) finds in him an illustration of the power of prayer. (See also [Luke 4:25](/luke#Luke.4.25); [9:54](/luke#Luke.9.54).) He was a type of John the Baptist in the sternness and power of his reproofs ([Luke 9:8](/luke#Luke.9.8)). He was the Elijah that “must first come” ([Matt. 11:11](/matt#Matt.11.11), [14](/matt#Matt.11.14)), the forerunner of our Lord announced by Malachi. Even outwardly the Baptist corresponded so closely to the earlier prophet that he might be styled a second Elijah. In him we see “the same connection with a wild and wilderness country; the same long retirement in the desert; the same sudden, startling entrance on his work ([1 Kings 17:1](/1kgs#1Kgs.17.1); [Luke 3:2](/luke#Luke.3.2)); even the same dress, a hairy garment, and a leathern girdle about the loins ([2 Kings 1:8](/2kgs#2Kgs.1.8); [Matt. 3:4](/matt#Matt.3.4)).”

 How deep the impression was which Elijah made “on the mind of the nation may be judged from the fixed belief, which rested on the words of Malachi (4:5, 6), which many centuries after prevailed that he would again appear for the relief and restoration of the country. Each remarkable person as he arrives on the scene, be his habits and characteristics what they may, the stern John equally with his gentle Successor, is proclaimed to be Elijah ([Matt. 11:13](/matt#Matt.11.13), [14](/matt#Matt.11.14); 16:14; 17:10; [Mark 9:11](/mark#Mark.9.11); [15:35](/mark#Mark.15.35); [Luke 9:7](/luke#Luke.9.7), [8](/luke#Luke.9.8); [John 1:21](/john#John.1.21)).

[1 Chr. 28:19](/1chr#1Chr.28.19); [Jer. 36](/jer#Jer.36)), and acted as a prophet in Judah; while the Tishbite was a prophet of the northern kingdom. But there does not seem any necessity for concluding that the writer of this letter was some other Elijah than the Tishbite. It may be supposed either that Elijah anticipated the character of Jehoram, and so wrote the warning message, which was preserved in the schools of the prophets till Jehoram ascended the throne after the Tishbite’s translation, or that the translation did not actually take place till after the accession of Jehoram to the throne ([2 Chr. 21:12](/2chr#2Chr.21.12); [2 Kings 8:16](/2kgs#2Kgs.8.16)).

Elisha,1861,e-p172.4,Elisha,"God his salvation, the son of Shaphat of Abel-meholah, who became the attendant and disciple of Elijah ([1 Kings 19:16-19](/1kgs#1Kgs.19.16)). His name first occurs in the command given to Elijah to anoint him as his successor ([1 Kings 19:16](/1kgs#1Kgs.19.16)). This was the only one of the three commands then given to Elijah which he accomplished. On his way from Sinai to Damascus he found Elisha at his native place engaged in the labours of the field, ploughing with twelve yoke of oxen. He went over to him, threw over his shoulders his rough mantle, and at once adopted him as a son, and invested him with the prophetical office (comp. [Luke 9:61](/luke#Luke.9.61), [62](/luke#Luke.9.62)). Elisha accepted the call thus given (about four years before the death of Ahab), and for some seven or eight years became the close attendant on Elijah till he was parted from him and taken up into heaven. During all these years we hear nothing of Elisha except in connection with the closing scenes of Elijah’s life. After Elijah, Elisha was accepted as the leader of the sons of the prophets, and became noted in Israel. He possessed, according to his own request, “a double portion” of Elijah’s spirit ([2 Kings 2:9](/2kgs#2Kgs.2.9)); and for the long period of about sixty years (B.C. 892-832) held the office of “prophet in Israel” ([2 Kings 5:8](/2kgs#2Kgs.5.8)).

 After Elijah’s departure, Elisha returned to Jericho, and there healed the spring of water by casting salt into it ([2 Kings 2:21](/2kgs#2Kgs.2.21)). We next find him at Bethel (2:23), where, with the sternness of his master, he cursed the youths who came out and scoffed at him as a prophet of God: “Go up, thou bald head.” The judgment at once took effect, and God terribly visited the dishonour done to his prophet as dishonour done to himself. We next read of his predicting a fall of rain when the army of Jehoram was faint from thirst ([2 Kings 3:9-20](/2kgs#2Kgs.3.9)); of the multiplying of the poor widow’s cruse of oil (4:1-7); the miracle of restoring to life the son of the woman of Shunem (4:18-37); the multiplication of the twenty loaves of new barley into a sufficient supply for an hundred men (4:42-44); of the cure of Naaman the Syrian of his leprosy (5:1-27); of the punishment of Gehazi for his falsehood and his covetousness; of the recovery of the axe lost in the waters of the Jordan (6:1-7); of the miracle at Dothan, half-way on the road between Samaria and Jezreel; of the siege of Samaria by the king of Syria, and of the terrible sufferings of the people in connection with it, and Elisha’s prophecy as to the relief that would come ([2 Kings 6:24-7:2](/2kgs#2Kgs.6.24)).

 We then find Elisha at Damascus, to carry out the command given to his master to anoint Hazael king over Syria ([2 Kings 8:7-15](/2kgs#2Kgs.8.7)); thereafter he directs one of the sons of the prophets to anoint Jehu, the son of Jehoshaphat, king of Israel, instead of Ahab. Thus the three commands given to Elijah (9:1-10) were at length carried out.

 We do not again read of him till we find him on his death-bed in his own house ([2 Kings 13:14-19](/2kgs#2Kgs.13.14)). Joash, the grandson of Jehu, comes to mourn over his approaching departure, and utters the same words as those of Elisha when Elijah was taken away: “My father, my father! the chariot of Israel, and the horsemen thereof.”

 Afterwards when a dead body is laid in Elisha’s grave a year after his burial, no sooner does it touch the hallowed remains than the man “revived, and stood up on his feet” ([2 Kings 13:20-21](/2kgs#2Kgs.13.20)).",0.0,person,elisha_1153,elisha_1153,

This art was practised by the Egyptians from the earliest times, and there brought to great perfection. This custom probably originated in the belief in the future reunion of the soul with the body. The process became more and more complicated, and to such perfection was it carried that bodies embalmed thousands of years ago are preserved to the present day in the numberless mummies that have been discovered in Egypt.

 The embalming of Jacob and Joseph was according to the Egyptian custom, which was partially followed by the Jews ([2 Chr. 16:14](/2chr#2Chr.16.14)), as in the case of king Asa, and of our Lord ([John 19:39](/john#John.19.39), [40](/john#John.19.40); [Luke 23:56](/luke#Luke.23.56); [24:1](/luke#Luke.24.1)).",0.0,unmatched,unmatched,,

 The manner in which the Israelites encamped during their march through the wilderness is described in [Num. 2](/num#Num.2) and 3.

"Ephesians, Epistle to",1939,e-p247.3,"Ephesians, Epistle to","Was written by Paul at Rome about the same time as that to the Colossians, which in many points it resembles.

 Contents of. The Epistle to the Colossians is mainly polemical, designed to refute certain theosophic errors that had crept into the church there. That to the Ephesians does not seem to have originated in any special circumstances, but is simply a letter springing from Paul’s love to the church there, and indicative of his earnest desire that they should be fully instructed in the profound doctrines of the gospel. It contains (1) the salutation (1:1, 2); (2) a general description of the blessings the gospel reveals, as to their source, means by which they are attained, purpose for which they are bestowed, and their final result, with a fervent prayer for the further spiritual enrichment of the Ephesians (1:3-2:10); (3) “a record of that marked change in spiritual position which the Gentile believers now possessed, ending with an account of the writer’s selection to and qualification for the apostolate of heathendom, a fact so considered as to keep them from being dispirited, and to lead him to pray for enlarged spiritual benefactions on his absent sympathizers” (2:12-3:21); (4) a chapter on unity as undisturbed by diversity of gifts (4:1-16); (5) special injunctions bearing on ordinary life (4:17-6:10); (6) the imagery of a spiritual warfare, mission of Tychicus, and valedictory blessing (6:11-24).

 Planting of the church at Ephesus. Paul’s first and hurried visit for the space of three months to Ephesus is recorded in [Acts 18:19-21](/acts#Acts.18.19). The work he began on this occasion was carried forward by Apollos (24-26) and Aquila and Priscilla. On his second visit, early in the following year, he remained at Ephesus “three years,” for he found it was the key to the western provinces of Asia Minor. Here “a great door and effectual” was opened to him ([1 Cor. 16:9](/1cor#1Cor.16.9)), and the church was established and strengthened by his assiduous labours there ([Acts 20:20](/acts#Acts.20.20), [31](/acts#Acts.20.31)). From Ephesus as a centre the gospel spread abroad “almost throughout all Asia” (19:26). The word “mightily grew and prevailed” despite all the opposition and persecution he encountered.

 On his last journey to Jerusalem the apostle landed at Miletus, and summoning together the elders of the church from Ephesus, delivered to them his remarkable farewell charge ([Acts 20:18-35](/acts#Acts.20.18)), expecting to see them no more.

 Place and date of the writing of the letter. It was evidently written from Rome during Paul’s first imprisonment (3:1; 4:1; 6:20), and probably soon after his arrival there, about the year 62, four years after he had parted with the Ephesian elders at Miletus. The subscription of this epistle is correct.

 There seems to have been no special occasion for the writing of this letter, as already noted. Paul’s object was plainly not polemical. No errors had sprung up in the church which he sought to point out and refute. The object of the apostle is “to set forth the ground, the cause, and the aim and end of the church of the faithful in Christ. He speaks to the Ephesians as a type or sample of the church universal.” The church’s foundations, its course, and its end, are his theme. “Everywhere the foundation of the church is the will of the Father; the course of the church is by the satisfaction of the Son; the end of the church is the life in the Holy Spirit.” In the Epistle to the Romans, Paul writes from the point of view of justification by the imputed righteousness of Christ; here he writes from the point of view specially of union to the Redeemer, and hence of the oneness of the true church of Christ. “This is perhaps the profoundest book in existence.” It is a book “which sounds the lowest depths of Christian doctrine, and scales the loftiest heights of Christian experience;” and the fact that the apostle evidently expected the Ephesians to understand it is an evidence of the “proficiency which Paul’s converts had attained under his preaching at Ephesus.”

 Relation between this epistle and that to the Colossians (q.v.). “The letters of the apostle are the fervent outburst of pastoral zeal and attachment, written without reserve and in unaffected simplicity; sentiments come warm from the heart, without the shaping out, pruning, and punctilious arrangement of a formal discourse. There is such a fresh and familiar transcription of feeling, so frequent an introduction of coloquial idiom, and so much of conversational frankness and vivacity, that the reader associates the image of the writer with every paragraph, and the ear seems to catch and recognize the very tones of living address.” “Is it then any matter of amazement that one letter should resemble another, or that two written about the same time should have so much in common and so much that is peculiar? The close relation as to style and subject between the epistles to Colosse and Ephesus must strike every reader. Their precise relation to each other has given rise to much discussion. The great probability is that the epistle to Colosse was first written; the parallel passages in Ephesians, which amount to about forty-two in number, having the appearance of being expansions from the epistle to Colosse. Compare:

Ephesus,1945,e-p262.2,Ephesus,"The capital of proconsular Asia, which was the western part of Asia Minor. It was colonized principally from Athens. In the time of the Romans it bore the title of “the first and greatest metropolis of Asia.” It was distinguished for the Temple of Diana (q.v.), who there had her chief shrine; and for its theatre, which was the largest in the world, capable of containing 50,000 spectators. It was, like all ancient theatres, open to the sky. Here were exhibited the fights of wild beasts and of men with beasts. (Comp. [1 Cor. 4:9](/1cor#1Cor.4.9); [9:24](/1cor#1Cor.9.24), [25](/1cor#1Cor.9.25); [15:32](/1cor#1Cor.15.32).)

 Many Jews took up their residence in this city, and here the seeds of the gospel were sown immediately after Pentecost ([Acts 2:9](/acts#Acts.2.9); [6:9](/acts#Acts.6.9)). At the close of his second missionary journey (about A.D. 51), when Paul was returning from Greece to Syria (18:18-21), he first visited this city. He remained, however, for only a short time, as he was hastening to keep the feast, probably of Pentecost, at Jerusalem; but he left Aquila and Priscilla behind him to carry on the work of spreading the gospel.

 During his third missionary journey Paul reached Ephesus from the “upper coasts” ([Acts 19:1](/acts#Acts.19.1)), i.e., from the inland parts of Asia Minor, and tarried here for about three years; and so successful and abundant were his labours that “all they which dwelt in Asia heard the word of the Lord Jesus, both Jews and Greeks” (19:10). Probably during this period the seven churches of the Apocalypse were founded, not by Paul’s personal labours, but by missionaries whom he may have sent out from Ephesus, and by the influence of converts returning to their homes.

 On his return from his journey, Paul touched at Miletus, some 30 miles south of Ephesus ([Acts 20:15](/acts#Acts.20.15)), and sending for the presbyters of Ephesus to meet him there, he delivered to them that touching farewell charge which is recorded in [Acts 20:18-35](/acts#Acts.20.18). Ephesus is not again mentioned till near the close of Paul’s life, when he writes to Timothy exhorting him to “abide still at Ephesus” ([1 Tim. 1:3](/1tim#1Tim.1.3)).

 Two of Paul’s companions, Trophimus and Tychicus, were probably natives of Ephesus ([Acts 20:4](/acts#Acts.20.4); [21:29](/acts#Acts.21.29); [2 Tim. 4:12](/2tim#2Tim.4.12)). In his second epistle to Timothy, Paul speaks of Onesiphorus as having served him in many things at Ephesus ([2 Tim. 1:18](/2tim#2Tim.1.18)). He also “sent Tychicus to Ephesus” (4:12), probably to attend to the interests of the church there. Ephesus is twice mentioned in the Apocalypse (1:11; 2:1).

 The apostle John, according to tradition, spent many years in Ephesus, where he died and was buried.

 A part of the site of this once famous city is now occupied by a small Turkish village, Ayasaluk, which is regarded as a corruption of the two Greek words, hagios theologos; i.e., “the holy divine.”",0.0,place,ephesus_400,,ephesus_400

The two pieces were joined together over the shoulders (hence in Latin called superhumerale) by clasps or buckles of gold or precious stones, and fastened round the waist by a “curious girdle of gold, blue, purple, and fine twined linen” (28:6-12).

The descendants of Joseph formed two of the tribes of Israel, whereas each of the other sons of Jacob was the founder of only one tribe. Thus there were in reality thirteen tribes; but the number twelve was preserved by excluding that of Levi when Ephraim and Manasseh are mentioned separately ([Num. 1:32-34](/num#Num.1.32); [Josh. 17:14](/josh#Josh.17.14), [17](/josh#Josh.17.17); [1 Chr. 7:20](/1chr#1Chr.7.20)).

 Territory of. At the time of the first census in the wilderness this tribe numbered 40,500 ([Num. 1:32](/num#Num.1.32), [33](/num#Num.1.33)); forty years later, when about to take possession of the Promised Land, it numbered only 32,500. During the march (see CAMP) Ephraim’s place was on the west side of the tabernacle ([Num. 2:18-24](/num#Num.2.18)). When the spies were sent out to spy the land, “Oshea the son of Nun” of this tribe signalized himself.

 The boundaries of the portion of the land assigned to Ephraim are given in [Josh. 16:1-10](/josh#Josh.16.1). It included most of what was afterwards called Samaria as distinguished from Judea and Galilee. It thus lay in the centre of all traffic, from north to south, and from Jordan to the sea, and was about 55 miles long and 30 broad. The tabernacle and the ark were deposited within its limits at Shiloh, where it remained for four hundred years. During the time of the judges and the first stage of the monarchy this tribe manifested a domineering and haughty and discontented spirit. “For more than five hundred years, a period equal to that which elapsed between the Norman Conquest and the War of the Roses, Ephraim, with its two dependent tribes of Manasseh and Benjamin, exercised undisputed pre-eminence. Joshua the first conqueror, Gideon the greatest of the judges, and Saul the first king, belonged to one or other of the three tribes. It was not till the close of the first period of Jewish history that God ‘refused the tabernacle of Joseph, and chose not the tribe of Ephraim, but chose the tribe of Judah, the Mount Zion which he loved’ ([Ps. 78:67](/ps#Ps.78.67), [68](/ps#Ps.78.68)). When the ark was removed from Shiloh to Zion the power of Ephraim was humbled.”

 Among the causes which operated to bring about the disruption of Israel was Ephraim’s jealousy of the growing power of Judah. From the settlement of Canaan till the time of David and Solomon, Ephraim had held the place of honour among the tribes. It occupied the central and fairest portions of the land, and had Shiloh and Shechem within its borders. But now when Jerusalem became the capital of the kingdom, and the centre of power and worship for the whole nation of Israel, Ephraim declined in influence.

These are not arranged in the New Testament in the order of time as to their composition, but rather according to the rank of the cities or places to which they were sent. Who arranged them after this manner is unknown. Paul’s letters were, as a rule, dictated to an amanuensis, a fact which accounts for some of their peculiarities. He authenticated them, however, by adding a few words in his own hand at the close.

Epistles 2,1964,e-p287.3,Epistles,"The Catholic or General Epistles, so called because they are not addressed to any particular church or city or individual, but to Christians in general, or to Christians in several countries. Of these, three are written by John, two by Peter, and one each by James and Jude.

 It is an interesting and instructive fact that a large portion of the New Testament is taken up with epistles. The doctrines of Christianity are thus not set forth in any formal treatise, but mainly in a collection of letters. “Christianity was the first great missionary religion. It was the first to break the bonds of race and aim at embracing all mankind. But this necessarily involved a change in the mode in which it was presented. The prophet of the Old Testament, if he had anything to communicate, either appeared in person or sent messengers to speak for him by word of mouth. The narrow limits of Palestine made direct personal communication easy. But the case was different when the Christian Church came to consist of a number of scattered parts, stretching from Mesopotamia in the east to Rome or even Spain in the far west. It was only natural that the apostle by whom the greater number of these communities had been founded should seek to communicate with them by letter.”",2.0,unmatched,unmatched,,

Nothing further is recorded of him in Scripture, except that he settled certain colonists in Samaria ([Ezra 4:2](/ezra#Ezra.4.2)). But from the monuments it appears that he was the most powerful of all the Assyrian monarchs. He built many temples and palaces, the most magnificent of which was the south-west palace at Nimrud, which is said to have been in its general design almost the same as Solomon’s palace, only much larger ([1 Kings 7:1-12](/1kgs#1Kgs.7.1)).

 In December B.C. 681 Sennacherib was murdered by two of his sons, who, after holding Nineveh for forty-two days, were compelled to fly to Erimenas of Ararat, or Armenia. Their brother Esarhaddon, who had been engaged in a campaign against Armenia, led his army against them. They were utterly overthrown in a battle fought April B.C. 680, near Malatiyeh, and in the following month Esarhaddon was crowned at Nineveh. He restored Babylon, conquered Egypt, and received tribute from Manasseh of Judah.

Esau,1971,e-p297.1,Esau,"Hairy, Rebekah’s first-born twin son ([Gen. 25:25](/gen#Gen.25.25)). The name of Edom, “red”, was also given to him from his conduct in connection with the red lentil “pottage” for which he sold his birthright (30, 31). The circumstances connected with his birth foreshadowed the enmity which afterwards subsisted between the twin brothers and the nations they founded (25:22, 23, 26). In process of time Jacob, following his natural bent, became a shepherd; while Esau, a “son of the desert,” devoted himself to the perilous and toilsome life of a huntsman. On a certain occasion, on returning from the chase, urged by the cravings of hunger, Esau sold his birthright to his brother, Jacob, who thereby obtained the covenant blessing ([Gen. 27:28](/gen#Gen.27.28), [29](/gen#Gen.27.29), [36](/gen#Gen.27.36); [Heb. 12:16](/heb#Heb.12.16), [17](/heb#Heb.12.17)). He afterwards tried to regain what he had so recklessly parted with, but was defeated in his attempts through the stealth of his brother ([Gen. 27:4](/gen#Gen.27.4), [34](/gen#Gen.27.34), [38](/gen#Gen.27.38)).

 At the age of forty years, to the great grief of his parents, he married ([Gen. 26:34](/gen#Gen.26.34), [35](/gen#Gen.26.35)) two Canaanitish maidens, Judith, the daughter of Beeri, and Bashemath, the daughter of Elon. When Jacob was sent away to Padan-aram, Esau tried to conciliate his parents ([Gen. 28:8](/gen#Gen.28.8), [9](/gen#Gen.28.9)) by marrying his cousin Mahalath, the daughter of Ishmael. This led him to cast in his lot with the Ishmaelite tribes; and driving the Horites out of Mount Seir, he settled in that region. After some thirty years’ sojourn in Padan-aram Jacob returned to Canaan, and was reconciled to Esau, who went forth to meet him (33:4). Twenty years after this, Isaac their father died, when the two brothers met, probably for the last time, beside his grave (35:29). Esau now permanently left Canaan, and established himself as a powerful and wealthy chief in the land of Edom (q.v.).

 Long after this, when the descendants of Jacob came out of Egypt, the Edomites remembered the old quarrel between the brothers, and with fierce hatred they warred against Israel.",0.0,person,esau_1216,esau_1216,esau_408

It is drained by “that ancient river” the Kishon, which flows westward to the Mediterranean. From the foot of Mount Tabor it branches out into three valleys, that on the north passing between Tabor and Little Hermon ([Judg. 4:14](/judg#Judg.4.14)); that on the south between Mount Gilboa and En-gannim ([2 Kings 9:27](/2kgs#2Kgs.9.27)); while the central portion, the “valley of Jezreel” proper, runs into the Jordan valley (which is about 1,000 feet lower than Esdraelon) by Bethshean. Here Gideon gained his great victory over the Midianites ([Judg. 7:1-25](/judg#Judg.7.1)). Here also Barak defeated Sisera, and Saul’s army was defeated by the Philistines, and king Josiah, while fighting in disguise against Necho, king of Egypt, was slain ([2 Chr. 35:20-27](/2chr#2Chr.35.20); [2 Kings 23](/2kgs#2Kgs.23)-29). This plain has been well called the “battle-field of Palestine.” “It has been a chosen place for encampment in every contest carried on in this country, from the days of Nebuchadnezzar, king of the Assyrians, in the history of whose wars with Arphaxad it is mentioned as the Great Plain of Esdraelon, until the disastrous march of Napoleon Bonaparte from Egypt into Syria.

She was a Jewess named Hadas’sah (the myrtle), but when she entered the royal harem she received the name by which she henceforth became known ([Esther 2:7](/esth#Esth.2.7)). It is a Syro-Arabian modification of the Persian word satarah, which means a star. She was the daughter of Abihail, a Benjamite. Her family did not avail themselves of the permission granted by Cyrus to the exiles to return to Jerusalem; and she resided with her cousin Mordecai, who held some office in the household of the Persian king at “Shushan in the palace.” Ahasuerus having divorced Vashti, chose Esther to be his wife. Soon after this he gave Haman the Agagite, his prime minister, power and authority to kill and extirpate all the Jews throughout the Persian empire. By the interposition of Esther this terrible catastrophe was averted. Haman was hanged on the gallows he had intended for Mordecai ([Esther 7](/esth#Esth.7)); and the Jews established an annual feast, the feast of Purim (q.v.), in memory of their wonderful deliverance. This took place about fifty-two years after the Return, the year of the great battles of Plataea and Mycale (B.C. 479).

 Esther appears in the Bible as a “woman of deep piety, faith, courage, patriotism, and caution, combined with resolution; a dutiful daughter to her adopted father, docile and obedient to his counsels, and anxious to share the king’s favour with him for the good of the Jewish people. There must have been a singular grace and charm in her aspect and manners, since ‘she obtained favour in the sight of all them that looked upon her’ ([Esther 2:15](/esth#Esth.2.15)).

Eternal death,1989,e-p317.2,Eternal death,"The miserable fate of the wicked in hell ([Matt. 25:46](/matt#Matt.25.46); [Mark 3:29](/mark#Mark.3.29); [Heb. 6:2](/heb#Heb.6.2); [2 Thess. 1:9](/2thess#2Thess.1.9); [Matt. 18:8](/matt#Matt.18.8); [25:41](/matt#Matt.25.41); [Jude 1](/jude#Jude.1.1):7). The Scripture as clearly teaches the unending duration of the penal sufferings of the lost as the “everlasting life,” the “eternal life” of the righteous. The same Greek words in the New Testament (aion, aionios, aidios) are used to express (1) the eternal existence of God ([1 Tim. 1:17](/1tim#1Tim.1.17); [Rom. 1:20](/rom#Rom.1.20); [16:26](/rom#Rom.16.26)); (2) of Christ ([Rev. 1:18](/rev#Rev.1.18)); (3) of the Holy Ghost ([Heb. 9:14](/heb#Heb.9.14)); and (4) the eternal duration of the sufferings of the lost ([Matt. 25:46](/matt#Matt.25.46); [Jude 1](/jude#Jude.1.1):6).

 Their condition after casting off the mortal body is spoken of in these expressive words: “Fire that shall not be quenched” ([Mark 9:45](/mark#Mark.9.45), [46](/mark#Mark.9.46)), “fire unquenchable” ([Luke 3:17](/luke#Luke.3.17)), “the worm that never dies,” the “bottomless pit” ([Rev. 9:1](/rev#Rev.9.1)), “the smoke of their torment ascending up for ever and ever” ([Rev. 14:10](/rev#Rev.14.10), [11](/rev#Rev.14.11)).

 The idea that the “second death” ([Rev. 20:14](/rev#Rev.20.14)) is in the case of the wicked their absolute destruction, their annihilation, has not the slightest support from Scripture, which always represents their future as one of conscious suffering enduring for ever.

 The supposition that God will ultimately secure the repentance and restoration of all sinners is equally unscriptural. There is not the slightest trace in all the Scriptures of any such restoration. Sufferings of themselves have no tendency to purify the soul from sin or impart spiritual life. The atoning death of Christ and the sanctifying power of the Holy Spirit are the only means of divine appointment for bringing men to repentance. Now in the case of them that perish these means have been rejected, and “there remaineth no more sacrifice for sins” ([Heb. 10:26](/heb#Heb.10.26), [27](/heb#Heb.10.27)).",0.0,unmatched,unmatched,,
Eternal life,1990,e-p321.3,Eternal life,"This expression occurs in the Old Testament only in [Dan. 12:2](/dan#Dan.12.2) (R.V., “everlasting life”).

It is the final reward and glory into which the children of God enter ([1 Tim. 6:12](/1tim#1Tim.6.12), [19](/1tim#1Tim.6.19); [Rom. 6:22](/rom#Rom.6.22); [Gal. 6:8](/gal#Gal.6.8); [1 Tim. 1:16](/1tim#1Tim.1.16); [Rom. 5:21](/rom#Rom.5.21)); their Sabbath of rest ([Heb. 4:9](/heb#Heb.4.9); comp. 12:22).

 The newness of life which the believer derives from Christ ([Rom. 6:4](/rom#Rom.6.4)) is the very essence of salvation, and hence the life of glory or the eternal life must also be theirs ([Rom. 6:8](/rom#Rom.6.8); [2 Tim. 2:11](/2tim#2Tim.2.11), [12](/2tim#2Tim.2.12); [Rom. 5:17](/rom#Rom.5.17), [21](/rom#Rom.5.21); 8:30; [Eph. 2:5](/eph#Eph.2.5), [6](/eph#Eph.2.6)).

Euphrates,2003,e-p337.2,Euphrates,"Hebrew, Perath; Assyrian, Purat; Persian cuneiform, Ufratush, whence Greek Euphrates, meaning “sweet water.” The Assyrian name means “the stream,” or “the great stream.” It is generally called in the Bible simply “the river” ([Ex. 23:31](/exod#Exod.23.31)), or “the great river” ([Deut. 1:7](/deut#Deut.1.7)).

 The Euphrates is first mentioned in [Gen. 2:14](/gen#Gen.2.14) as one of the rivers of Paradise. It is next mentioned in connection with the covenant which God entered into with Abraham (15:18), when he promised to his descendants the land from the river of Egypt to the river Euphrates (comp. [Deut. 11:24](/deut#Deut.11.24); [Josh. 1:4](/josh#Josh.1.4)), a covenant promise afterwards fulfilled in the extended conquests of David ([2 Sam. 8:2-14](/2sam#2Sam.8.2); [1 Chr. 18:3](/1chr#1Chr.18.3); [1 Kings 4:24](/1kgs#1Kgs.4.24)). It was then the boundary of the kingdom to the north-east. In the ancient history of Assyria, and Babylon, and Egypt many events are recorded in which mention is made of the “great river.” Just as the Nile represented in prophecy the power of Egypt, so the Euphrates represented the Assyrian power ([Isa. 8:7](/isa#Isa.8.7); [Jer. 2:18](/jer#Jer.2.18)).

 It is by far the largest and most important of all the rivers of Western Asia. From its source in the Armenian mountains to the Persian Gulf, into which it empties itself, it has a course of about 1,700 miles. It has two sources, (1) the Frat or Kara-su (i.e., “the black river”), which rises 25 miles north-east of Erzeroum; and (2) the Muradchai (i.e., “the river of desire”), which rises near Ararat, on the northern slope of Ala-tagh. At Kebban Maden, 400 miles from the source of the former, and 270 from that of the latter, they meet and form the majestic stream, which is at length joined by the Tigris at Koornah, after which it is called Shat-el-Arab, which runs in a deep and broad stream for above 140 miles to the sea.

The account of her creation is given in [Gen. 2:21](/gen#Gen.2.21), [22](/gen#Gen.2.22). The Creator, by declaring that it was not good for man to be alone, and by creating for him a suitable companion, gave sanction to monogamy.

Not from his head, lest she should rule over him; nor from his feet, lest he should tyrannize over her; but from his side, to denote that species of equality which is to subsist in the marriage state.” And again, “That wife that is of God’s making by special grace, and of God’s bringing by special providence, is likely to prove a helpmeet to her husband.” Through the subtle temptation of the serpent she violated the commandment of God by taking of the forbidden fruit, which she gave also unto her husband ([1 Tim. 2:13-15](/1tim#1Tim.2.13); [2 Cor. 11:3](/2cor#2Cor.11.3)).

In B.C. 598 ([Jer. 52:28](/jer#Jer.52.28); [2 Kings 24:12](/2kgs#2Kgs.24.12)), in the beginning of Jehoiachin’s reign ([2 Kings 24:8](/2kgs#2Kgs.24.8)), Nebuchadnezzar carried away captive 3,023 eminent Jews, including the king ([2 Chr. 36:10](/2chr#2Chr.36.10)), with his family and officers ([2 Kings 24:12](/2kgs#2Kgs.24.12)), and a large number of warriors (16), with very many persons of note (14), and artisans (16), leaving behind only those who were poor and helpless. This was the first general deportation to Babylon.

 In B.C. 588, after the revolt of Zedekiah (q.v.), there was a second general deportation of Jews by Nebuchadnezzar ([Jer. 52:29](/jer#Jer.52.29); [2 Kings 25:8](/2kgs#2Kgs.25.8)), including 832 more of the principal men of the kingdom. He carried away also the rest of the sacred vessels ([2 Chr. 36:18](/2chr#2Chr.36.18)). From this period, when the temple was destroyed ([2 Kings 25:9](/2kgs#2Kgs.25.9)), to the complete restoration, B.C. 517 ([Ezra 6:15](/ezra#Ezra.6.15)), is the period of the “seventy years.”

 In B.C. 582 occurred the last and final deportation. The entire number Nebuchadnezzar carried captive was 4,600 heads of families with their wives and children and dependants ([Jer. 52:30](/jer#Jer.52.30); [43:5-7](/jer#Jer.43.5); [2 Chr. 36:20](/2chr#2Chr.36.20), etc.). Thus the exiles formed a very considerable community in Babylon.

 When Cyrus granted permission to the Jews to return to their own land ([Ezra 1:5](/ezra#Ezra.1.5); [7:13](/ezra#Ezra.7.13)), only a comparatively small number at first availed themselves of the privilege. It cannot be questioned that many belonging to the kingdom of Israel ultimately joined the Jews under Ezra, Zerubbabel, and Nehemiah, and returned along with them to Jerusalem ([Jer. 50:4](/jer#Jer.50.4), [5](/jer#Jer.50.5), [17](/jer#Jer.50.17)-20, 33-35).

Exodus,2019,e-p359.3,Exodus,"The great deliverance wrought for the children of Isreal when they were brought out of the land of Egypt with “a mighty hand and with an outstretched arm” ([Ex 12:51](/exod#Exod.12.51); [Deut. 26:8](/deut#Deut.26.8); [Ps 114](/ps#Ps.114); [136](/ps#Ps.136)), about B.C. 1490, and four hundred and eighty years ([1 Kings 6:1](/1kgs#1Kgs.6.1)) before the building of Solomon’s temple.

 The time of their sojourning in Egypt was, according to [Ex. 12:40](/exod#Exod.12.40), the space of four hundred and thirty years. In the LXX., the words are, “The sojourning of the children of Israel which they sojourned in Egypt and in the land of Canaan was four hundred and thirty years;” and the Samaritan version reads, “The sojourning of the children of Israel and of their fathers which they sojourned in the land of Canaan and in the land of Egypt was four hundred and thirty years.” In [Gen. 15:13-16](/gen#Gen.15.13), the period is prophetically given (in round numbers) as four hundred years. This passage is quoted by Stephen in his defence before the council ([Acts 7:6](/acts#Acts.7.6)).

 The chronology of the “sojourning” is variously estimated. Those who adopt the longer term reckon thus:

 |                          Years | |    From the descent of Jacob into Egypt to the |     death of Joseph               71 | |    From the death of Joseph to the birth of |     Moses                    278 | |    From the birth of Moses to his flight into |     Midian                    40 | |    From the flight of Moses to his return into |     Egypt                    40 | |    From the return of Moses to the [Exodus     1](/exod#Exod.1) | |                           430

 Others contend for the shorter period of two hundred and fifteen years, holding that the period of four hundred and thirty years comprehends the years from the entrance of Abraham into Canaan (see LXX. and Samaritan) to the descent of Jacob into Egypt. They reckon thus:

 |                          Years | |    From Abraham’s arrival in Canaan to Isaac’s |     birth                    25 | |    From Isaac’s birth to that of his twin sons |     Esau and Jacob                60 | |    From Jacob’s birth to the going down into |     Egypt                    130 | |                          (215) | |    From Jacob’s going down into Egypt to the |     death of Joseph               71 | |    From death of Joseph to the birth of Moses   64 | |    From birth of Moses to the [Exodus       80](/exod#Exod.80) | |                      In all... 430

 During the forty years of Moses’ sojourn in the land of Midian, the Hebrews in Egypt were being gradually prepared for the great national crisis which was approaching. The plagues that successively fell upon the land loosened the bonds by which Pharaoh held them in slavery, and at length he was eager that they should depart. But the Hebrews must now also be ready to go. They were poor; for generations they had laboured for the Egyptians without wages. They asked gifts from their neighbours around them ([Ex. 12:35](/exod#Exod.12.35)), and these were readily bestowed. And then, as the first step towards their independent national organization, they observed the feast of the Passover, which was now instituted as a perpetual memorial. The blood of the paschal lamb was duly sprinkled on the door-posts and lintels of all their houses, and they were all within, waiting the next movement in the working out of God’s plan. At length the last stroke fell on the land of Egypt. “It came to pass, that at midnight Jehovah smote all the firstborn in the land of Egypt.” Pharaoh rose up in the night, and called for Moses and Aaron by night, and said, “Rise up, and get you forth from among my people, both ye and the children of Israel; and go, serve Jehovah, as ye have said. Also take your flocks and your herds, as ye have said, and be gone; and bless me also.” Thus was Pharaoh (q.v.) completely humbled and broken down. These words he spoke to Moses and Aaron “seem to gleam through the tears of the humbled king, as he lamented his son snatched from him by so sudden a death, and tremble with a sense of the helplessness which his proud soul at last felt when the avenging hand of God had visited even his palace.”

 The terror-stricken Egyptians now urged the instant departure of the Hebrews. In the midst of the Passover feast, before the dawn of the 15th day of the month Abib (our April nearly), which was to be to them henceforth the beginning of the year, as it was the commencement of a new epoch in their history, every family, with all that appertained to it, was ready for the march, which instantly began under the leadership of the heads of tribes with their various sub-divisions. They moved onward, increasing as they went forward from all the districts of Goshen, over the whole of which they were scattered, to the common centre. Three or four days perhaps elapsed before the whole body of the people were assembled at Rameses, and ready to set out under their leader Moses ([Ex. 12:37](/exod#Exod.12.37); [Num. 33:3](/num#Num.33.3)). This city was at that time the residence of the Egyptian court, and here the interviews between Moses and Pharaoh had taken place.

 From Rameses they journeyed to Succoth ([Ex. 12:37](/exod#Exod.12.37)), identified with Tel-el-Maskhuta, about 12 miles west of Ismailia. Their third station was Etham (q.v.), 13:20, “in the edge of the wilderness,” and was probably a little to the west of the modern town of Ismailia, on the Suez Canal. Here they were commanded “to turn and encamp before Pi-hahiroth, between Migdol and the sea”, i.e., to change their route from east to due south. The Lord now assumed the direction of their march in the pillar of cloud by day and of fire by night. They were then led along the west shore of the Red Sea till they came to an extensive camping-ground “before Pi-hahiroth,” about 40 miles from Etham. This distance from Etham may have taken three days to traverse, for the number of camping-places by no means indicates the number of days spent on the journey: e.g., it took fully a month to travel from Rameses to the wilderness of Sin ([Ex. 16:1](/exod#Exod.16.1)), yet reference is made to only six camping-places during all that time. The exact spot of their encampment before they crossed the Red Sea cannot be determined. It was probably somewhere near the present site of Suez.

 Under the direction of God the children of Israel went “forward” from the camp “before Pi-hahiroth,” and the sea opened a pathway for them, so that they crossed to the farther shore in safety. The Egyptian host pursued after them, and, attempting to follow through the sea, were overwhelmed in its returning waters, and thus the whole military force of the Egyptians perished. They “sank as lead in the mighty waters” ([Ex. 15:1-9](/exod#Exod.15.1); comp. [Ps. 77:16-19](/ps#Ps.77.16)).

 Having reached the eastern shore of the sea, perhaps a little way to the north of ‘Ayun Musa (“the springs of Moses”), there they encamped and rested probably for a day. Here Miriam and the other women sang the triumphal song recorded in [Ex. 15:1-21](/exod#Exod.15.1).

 From ‘Ayun Musa they went on for three days through a part of the barren “wilderness of Shur” (22), called also the “wilderness of Etham” ([Num. 33:8](/num#Num.33.8); comp. [Ex. 13:20](/exod#Exod.13.20)), without finding water. On the last of these days they came to Marah (q.v.), where the “bitter” water was by a miracle made drinkable.

 Their next camping-place was Elim (q.v.), where were twelve springs of water and a grove of “threescore and ten” palm trees ([Ex. 15:27](/exod#Exod.15.27)).

 After a time the children of Israel “took their journey from Elim,” and encamped by the Red Sea ([Num. 33:10](/num#Num.33.10)), and thence removed to the “wilderness of Sin” (to be distinguished from the wilderness of Zin, 20:1), where they again encamped. Here, probably the modern el-Markha, the supply of bread they had brought with them out of Egypt failed. They began to “murmur” for want of bread. God “heard their murmurings” and gave them quails and manna, “bread from heaven” ([Ex. 16:4-36](/exod#Exod.16.4)). Moses directed that an omer of manna should be put aside and preserved as a perpetual memorial of God’s goodness. They now turned inland, and after three encampments came to the rich and fertile valley of Rephidim, in the Wady Feiran. Here they found no water, and again murmured against Moses. Directed by God, Moses procured a miraculous supply of water from the “rock in Horeb,” one of the hills of the Sinai group (17:1-7); and shortly afterwards the children of Israel here fought their first battle with the Amalekites, whom they smote with the edge of the sword.

 From the eastern extremity of the Wady Feiran the line of march now probably led through the Wady esh-Sheikh and the Wady Solaf, meeting in the Wady er-Rahah, “the enclosed plain in front of the magnificient cliffs of Ras Sufsafeh.” Here they encamped for more than a year ([Num. 1:1](/num#Num.1.1); [10:11](/num#Num.10.11)) before Sinai (q.v.).

 The different encampments of the children of Israel, from the time of their leaving Egypt till they reached the Promised Land, are mentioned in [Ex. 12:37-19](/exod#Exod.12.37); [Num. 10](/num#Num.10)-21; 33; [Deut. 1](/deut#Deut.1), [2](/deut#Deut.2), [10](/deut#Deut.10).

 The expression ([Prov. 23:31](/prov#Prov.23.31)), “when it giveth his colour in the cup,” is literally, “when it giveth out [or showeth] its eye.” The beads or bubbles of wine are thus spoken of. “To set the eyes” on any one is to view him with favour ([Gen. 44:21](/gen#Gen.44.21); [Job 24:23](/job#Job.24.23); [Jer. 39:12](/jer#Jer.39.12)). This word is used figuratively in the expressions an “evil eye” ([Matt. 20:15](/matt#Matt.20.15)), a “bountiful eye” ([Prov. 22:9](/prov#Prov.22.9)), “haughty eyes” (6:17 marg.), “wanton eyes” ([Isa. 3:16](/isa#Isa.3.16)), “eyes full of adultery” (2 Pet. 2:14), “the lust of the eyes” ([1 John 2:16](/1john#1John.2.16)). Christians are warned against “eye-service” ([Eph. 6:6](/eph#Eph.6.6); [Col. 3:22](/col#Col.3.22)).

 The closing visions of this book are referred to in the book of Revelation ([Ezek. 38](/ezek#Ezek.38)=[Rev. 20:8](/rev#Rev.20.8); [Ezek. 47:1-8](/ezek#Ezek.47.1)=[Rev. 22:1](/rev#Rev.22.1),[2](/rev#Rev.22.2)).

 It may be noted that Daniel, fourteen years after his deportation from Jerusalem, is mentioned by Ezekiel (14:14) along with Noah and Job as distinguished for his righteousness, and some five years later he is spoken of as pre-eminent for his wisdom (28:3).

 Ezekiel’s prophecies are characterized by symbolical and allegorical representations, “unfolding a rich series of majestic visions and of colossal symbols.” There are a great many also of “symbolcal actions embodying vivid conceptions on the part of the prophet” (4:1-4; 5:1-4; 12:3-6; 24:3-5; 37:16, etc.) “The mode of representation, in which symbols and allegories occupy a prominent place, gives a dark, mysterious character to the prophecies of Ezekiel. They are obscure and enigmatical. A cloudy mystery overhangs them which it is almost impossible to penetrate. Jerome calls the book ‘a labyrith of the mysteries of God.’ It was because of this obscurity that the Jews forbade any one to read it till he had attained the age of thirty.”

 Ezekiel is singular in the frequency with which he refers to the Pentateuch (e.g., [Ezek. 27](/ezek#Ezek.27); [28:13](/ezek#Ezek.28.13); [31:8](/ezek#Ezek.31.8); [36:11](/ezek#Ezek.36.11), [34](/ezek#Ezek.36.34); [47:13](/ezek#Ezek.47.13), etc.).

Ezra 2,2045,e-p401.8,Ezra,"The “scribe” who led the second body of exiles that returned from Babylon to Jerusalem B.C. 459, and author of the book of Scripture which bears his name. He was the son, or perhaps grandson, of Seraiah ([2 Kings 25:18-21](/2kgs#2Kgs.25.18)), and a lineal descendant of Phinehas, the son of Aaron ([Ezra 7:1-5](/ezra#Ezra.7.1)). All we know of his personal history is contained in the last four chapters of his book, and in [Neh. 8](/neh#Neh.8) and 12:26.

 In the seventh year of the reign of Artaxerxes Longimanus (see DARIUS), he obtained leave to go up to Jerusalem and to take with him a company of Israelites ([Ezra 8](/ezra#Ezra.8)). Artaxerxes manifested great interest in Ezra’s undertaking, granting him “all his request,” and loading him with gifts for the house of God. Ezra assembled the band of exiles, probably about 5,000 in all, who were prepared to go up with him to Jerusalem, on the banks of the Ahava, where they rested for three days, and were put into order for their march across the desert, which was completed in four months. His proceedings at Jerusalem on his arrival there are recorded in his book.

 He was “a ready scribe in the law of Moses,” who “had prepared his heart to seek the law of the Lord and to do it, and to teach in Israel statutes and judgments.” “He is,” says Professor Binnie, “the first well-defined example of an order of men who have never since ceased in the church; men of sacred erudition, who devote their lives to the study of the Holy Scriptures, in order that they may be in a condition to interpret them for the instruction and edification of the church. It is significant that the earliest mention of the pulpit occurs in the history of Ezra’s ministry ([Neh. 8:4](/neh#Neh.8.4)). He was much more of a teacher than a priest. We learn from the account of his labours in the book of Nehemiah that he was careful to have the whole people instructed in the law of Moses; and there is no reason to reject the constant tradition of the Jews which connects his name with the collecting and editing of the Old Testament canon. The final completion of the canon may have been, and probably was, the work of a later generation; but Ezra seems to have put it much into the shape in which it is still found in the Hebrew Bible. When it is added that the complete organization of the synagogue dates from this period, it will be seen that the age was emphatically one of Biblical study” (The Psalms: their History, etc.).

 For about fourteen years, i.e., till B.C. 445, we have no record of what went on in Jerusalem after Ezra had set in order the ecclesiastical and civil affairs of the nation. In that year another distinguished personage, Nehemiah, appears on the scene. After the ruined wall of the city had been built by Nehemiah, there was a great gathering of the people at Jerusalem preparatory to the dedication of the wall. On the appointed day the whole population assembled, and the law was read aloud to them by Ezra and his assistants ([Neh. 8:3](/neh#Neh.8.3)). The remarkable scene is described in detail. There was a great religious awakening. For successive days they held solemn assemblies, confessing their sins and offering up solemn sacrifices. They kept also the feast of Tabernacles with great solemnity and joyous enthusiasm, and then renewed their national covenant to be the Lord’s. Abuses were rectified, and arrangements for the temple service completed, and now nothing remained but the dedication of the walls of the city ([Neh. 12](/neh#Neh.12)).",2.0,person,ezra_1245,ezra_1245,

The “light of God’s countenance” is his favour ([Ps. 44:3](/ps#Ps.44.3); [Dan. 9:17](/dan#Dan.9.17)). “Face” signifies also anger, justice, severity ([Gen. 16:6](/gen#Gen.16.6), [8](/gen#Gen.16.8); [Ex. 2:15](/exod#Exod.2.15); [Ps. 68:1](/ps#Ps.68.1); [Rev. 6:16](/rev#Rev.6.16)). To “provoke God to his face” ([Isa. 65:3](/isa#Isa.65.3)) is to sin against him openly.

 Faith is the result of teaching ([Rom. 10:14-17](/rom#Rom.10.14)). Knowledge is an essential element in all faith, and is sometimes spoken of as an equivalent to faith ([John 10:38](/john#John.10.38); [1 John 2:3](/1john#1John.2.3)). Yet the two are distinguished in this respect, that faith includes in it assent, which is an act of the will in addition to the act of the understanding. Assent to the truth is of the essence of faith, and the ultimate ground on which our assent to any revealed truth rests is the veracity of God.

 Historical faith is the apprehension of and assent to certain statements which are regarded as mere facts of history.

 Temporary faith is that state of mind which is awakened in men (e.g., Felix) by the exhibition of the truth and by the influence of religious sympathy, or by what is sometimes styled the common operation of the Holy Spirit.

 Saving faith is so called because it has eternal life inseparably connected with it. It cannot be better defined than in the words of the Assembly’s Shorter Catechism: “Faith in Jesus Christ is a saving grace, whereby we receive and rest upon him alone for salvation, as he is offered to us in the gospel.”

 The object of saving faith is the whole revealed Word of God. Faith accepts and believes it as the very truth most sure. But the special act of faith which unites to Christ has as its object the person and the work of the Lord Jesus Christ ([John 7:38](/john#John.7.38); [Acts 16:31](/acts#Acts.16.31)). This is the specific act of faith by which a sinner is justified before God ([Rom. 3:22](/rom#Rom.3.22), [25](/rom#Rom.3.25); [Gal. 2:16](/gal#Gal.2.16); [Phil. 3:9](/phil#Phil.3.9); [John 3:16-36](/john#John.3.16); [Acts 10:43](/acts#Acts.10.43); [16:31](/acts#Acts.16.31)). In this act of faith the believer appropriates and rests on Christ alone as Mediator in all his offices.

 This assent to or belief in the truth received upon the divine testimony has always associated with it a deep sense of sin, a distinct view of Christ, a consenting will, and a loving heart, together with a reliance on, a trusting in, or resting in Christ. It is that state of mind in which a poor sinner, conscious of his sin, flees from his guilty self to Christ his Saviour, and rolls over the burden of all his sins on him. It consists chiefly, not in the assent given to the testimony of God in his Word, but in embracing with fiducial reliance and trust the one and only Saviour whom God reveals. This trust and reliance is of the essence of faith. By faith the believer directly and immediately appropriates Christ as his own. Faith in its direct act makes Christ ours. It is not a work which God graciously accepts instead of perfect obedience, but is only the hand by which we take hold of the person and work of our Redeemer as the only ground of our salvation.

 Saving faith is a moral act, as it proceeds from a renewed will, and a renewed will is necessary to believing assent to the truth of God ([1 Cor. 2:14](/1cor#1Cor.2.14); [2 Cor. 4:4](/2cor#2Cor.4.4)). Faith, therefore, has its seat in the moral part of our nature fully as much as in the intellectual. The mind must first be enlightened by divine teaching ([John 6:44](/john#John.6.44); [Acts 13:48](/acts#Acts.13.48); [2 Cor. 4:6](/2cor#2Cor.4.6); [Eph. 1:17](/eph#Eph.1.17), [18](/eph#Eph.1.18)) before it can discern the things of the Spirit.

 Faith is necessary to our salvation ([Mark 16:16](/mark#Mark.16.16)), not because there is any merit in it, but simply because it is the sinner’s taking the place assigned him by God, his falling in with what God is doing.

 The warrant or ground of faith is the divine testimony, not the reasonableness of what God says, but the simple fact that he says it. Faith rests immediately on, “Thus saith the Lord.” But in order to this faith the veracity, sincerity, and truth of God must be owned and appreciated, together with his unchangeableness. God’s word encourages and emboldens the sinner personally to transact with Christ as God’s gift, to close with him, embrace him, give himself to Christ, and take Christ as his. That word comes with power, for it is the word of God who has revealed himself in his works, and especially in the cross. God is to be believed for his word’s sake, but also for his name’s sake.

 Faith in Christ secures for the believer freedom from condemnation, or justification before God; a participation in the life that is in Christ, the divine life ([John 14:19](/john#John.14.19); [Rom. 6:4-10](/rom#Rom.6.4); [Eph. 4:15](/eph#Eph.4.15), [16](/eph#Eph.4.16), etc.); “peace with God” ([Rom. 5:1](/rom#Rom.5.1)); and sanctification ([Acts 26:18](/acts#Acts.26.18); [Gal. 5:6](/gal#Gal.5.6); [Acts 15:9](/acts#Acts.15.9)).

 All who thus believe in Christ will certainly be saved ([John 6:37](/john#John.6.37), [40](/john#John.6.40); [10:27](/john#John.10.27), [28](/john#John.10.28); [Rom. 8:1](/rom#Rom.8.1)).

Fall of man,2057,f-p20.7,Fall of man,"An expression probably borrowed from the Apocryphal Book of Wisdom, to express the fact of the revolt of our first parents from God, and the consequent sin and misery in which they and all their posterity were involved.

 The history of the Fall is recorded in [Gen. 2](/gen#Gen.2) and 3. That history is to be literally interpreted. It records facts which underlie the whole system of revealed truth. It is referred to by our Lord and his apostles not only as being true, but as furnishing the ground of all God’s subsequent dispensations and dealings with the children of men. The record of Adam’s temptation and fall must be taken as a true historical account, if we are to understand the Bible at all as a revelation of God’s purpose of mercy.

 The effects of this first sin upon our first parents themselves were (1) “shame, a sense of degradation and pollution; (2) dread of the displeasure of God, or a sense of guilt, and the consequent desire to hide from his presence. These effects were unavoidable. They prove the loss not only of innocence but of original righteousness, and, with it, of the favour and fellowship of God. The state therefore to which Adam was reduced by his disobedience, so far as his subjective condition is concerned, was analogous to that of the fallen angels. He was entirely and absolutely ruined” (Hodge’s Theology).

 Commenting on [John 9:3](/john#John.9.3), Ryle well remarks: “A deep and instructive principle lies in these words. They surely throw some light on that great question, the origin of evil. God has thought fit to allow evil to exist in order that he may have a platform for showing his mercy, grace, and compassion. If man had never fallen there would have been no opportunity of showing divine mercy. But by permitting evil, mysterious as it seems, God’s works of grace, mercy, and wisdom in saving sinners have been wonderfully manifested to all his creatures. The redeeming of the church of elect sinners is the means of ‘showing to principalities and powers the manifold wisdom of God’ ([Eph. 3:10](/eph#Eph.3.10)). Without the Fall we should have known nothing of the Cross and the Gospel.”

 On the monuments of Egypt are found representations of a deity in human form, piercing with a spear the head of a serpent. This is regarded as an illustration of the wide dissemination of the tradition of the Fall.

Land was allowed to lie fallow that it might become more fruitful; but when in this condition, it soon became overgrown with thorns and weeds. The cultivator of the soil was careful to “break up” his fallow ground, i.e., to clear the field of weeds, before sowing seed in it.

The fortifications consisted of one or two walls, on which were towers or parapets at regular intervals ([2 Chr. 32:5](/2chr#2Chr.32.5); [Jer. 31:38](/jer#Jer.31.38)). Around ancient Jerusalem were three walls, on one of which were ninety towers, on the second fourteen, and on the third sixty.

 Our Lord’s cursing the fig-tree near Bethany ([Mark 11:13](/mark#Mark.11.13)) has occasioned much perplexity from the circumstance, as mentioned by the evangelist, that “the time of figs was not yet.” The explanation of the words, however, lies in the simple fact that the fruit of the fig-tree appears before the leaves, and hence that if the tree produced leaves it ought also to have had fruit. It ought to have had fruit if it had been true to its “pretensions,” in showing its leaves at this particular season. “This tree, so to speak, vaunted itself to be in advance of all the other trees, challenged the passer-by that he should come and refresh himself with its fruit. Yet when the Lord accepted its challenge and drew near, it proved to be but as the others, without fruit as they; for indeed, as the evangelist observes, the time of figs had not yet arrived. Its fault, if one may use the word, lay in its pretensions, in its making a show to run before the rest when it did not so indeed” (Trench, Miracles).

The Jewish commentators regarded the Hebrew word here as connected with the word ’arab, which means “mingled;” and they accordingly supposed the plague to consist of a mixed multitude of animals, beasts, reptiles, and insects. But there is no doubt that “the ’arab“ denotes a single definite species. Some interpreters regard it as the Blatta orientalis, the cockroach, a species of beetle.

They had also quails ([Ex. 16:11-13](/exod#Exod.16.11); [Num. 11:31](/num#Num.11.31)).

 In the law of Moses there are special regulations as to the animals to be used for food ([Lev. 11](/lev#Lev.11); [Deut. 14:3-21](/deut#Deut.14.3)).

It was in this forest that Absalom was slain by Joab. David withdrew to the forest of Hareth in the mountains of Judah to avoid the fury of Saul ([1 Sam. 22:5](/1sam#1Sam.22.5)).

 “The forest of the vintage” ([Zech. 11:2](/zech#Zech.11.2), “inaccessible forest,” or R.V. “strong forest”) is probably a figurative allusion to Jerusalem, or the verse may simply point to the devastation of the region referred to.

 These fountains, bright sparkling “eyes” of the desert, are remarkable for their abundance and their beauty, especially on the west of Jordan.

The meaning of the injunction to the Israelites, with regard to the statues and precepts given them, that they should “bind them for a sign upon their hand, and have them as frontlets between their eyes,” was that they should keep them distinctly in view and carefully attend to them. But soon after their return from Babylon they began to interpret this injunction literally, and had accordingly portions of the law written out and worn about their person. These they called tephillin, i.e., “prayers.” The passages so written out on strips of parchment were these, [Ex. 12:2-10](/exod#Exod.12.2); [13:11-21](/exod#Exod.13.11); [Deut. 6:4-9](/deut#Deut.6.4); [11:18-21](/deut#Deut.11.18).

 The first traces of burning the dead are found in [1 Sam. 31:12](/1sam#1Sam.31.12). The burning of the body was affixed by the law of Moses as a penalty to certain crimes ([Lev. 20:14](/lev#Lev.20.14); [21:9](/lev#Lev.21.9)).

 To leave the dead unburied was regarded with horror ([1 Kings 13:22](/1kgs#1Kgs.13.22); [14:11](/1kgs#1Kgs.14.11); [16:4](/1kgs#1Kgs.16.4); [21:24](/1kgs#1Kgs.21.24), etc.).

 The tribe of Gad during the march through the wilderness had their place with Simeon and Reuben on the south side of the tabernacle ([Num. 2:14](/num#Num.2.14)). The tribes of Reuben and Gad continued all through their history to follow the pastoral pursuits of the patriarchs ([Num. 32:1-5](/num#Num.32.1)).

 The portion allotted to the tribe of Gad was on the east of Jordan, and comprehended the half of Gilead, a region of great beauty and fertility ([Deut. 3:12](/deut#Deut.3.12)), bounded on the east by the Arabian desert, on the west by the Jordan ([Josh. 13:27](/josh#Josh.13.27)), and on the north by the river Jabbok. It thus included the whole of the Jordan valley as far north as to the Sea of Galilee, where it narrowed almost to a point.

 This tribe was fierce and warlike; they were “strong men of might, men of war for the battle, that could handle shield and buckler, their faces the faces of lions, and like roes upon the mountains for swiftness” ([1 Chr. 12:8](/1chr#1Chr.12.8); [5:19-22](/1chr#1Chr.5.19)).

They were an intermixture of Gauls and Greeks, and hence were called Gallo-Graeci, and the country Gallo-Graecia. The Galatians were in their origin a part of that great Celtic migration which invaded Macedonia about B.C. 280. They were invited by the king of Bithynia to cross over into Asia Minor to assist him in his wars. There they ultimately settled, and being strengthened by fresh accessions of the same clan from Europe, they overran Bithynia, and supported themselves by plundering neighbouring countries. They were great warriors, and hired themselves out as mercenary soldiers, sometimes fighting on both sides in the great battles of the times. They were at length brought under the power of Rome in B.C. 189, and Galatia became a Roman province B.C. 25.

 This province of Galatia, within the limits of which these Celtic tribes were confined, was the central region of Asia Minor.

 During his second missionary journey Paul, accompanied by Silas and Timothy ([Acts 16:6](/acts#Acts.16.6)), visited the “region of Galatia,” where he was detained by sickness ([Gal. 4:13](/gal#Gal.4.13)), and had thus the longer opportunity of preaching to them the gospel. On his third journey he went over “all the country of Galatia and Phrygia in order” ([Acts 18:23](/acts#Acts.18.23)). Crescens was sent thither by Paul toward the close of his life ([2 Tim. 4:10](/2tim#2Tim.4.10)).",0.0,place,galatia_431,,galatia_431
"Galatians, Epistle to",2219,g-p22.5,"Galatians, Epistle to","The genuineness of this epistle is not called in question. Its Pauline origin is universally acknowledged.

 Occasion of. The churches of Galatia were founded by Paul himself ([Acts 16:6](/acts#Acts.16.6); [Gal. 1:8](/gal#Gal.1.8); [4:13](/gal#Gal.4.13), [19](/gal#Gal.4.19)). They seem to have been composed mainly of converts from heathenism (4:8), but partly also of Jewish converts, who probably, under the influence of Judaizing teachers, sought to incorporate the rites of Judaism with Christianity, and by their active zeal had succeeded in inducing the majority of the churches to adopt their views (1:6; 3:1). This epistle was written for the purpose of counteracting this Judaizing tendency, and of recalling the Galatians to the simplicity of the gospel, and at the same time also of vindicating Paul’s claim to be a divinely-commissioned apostle.

 Time and place of writing. The epistle was probably written very soon after Paul’s second visit to Galatia ([Acts 18:23](/acts#Acts.18.23)). The references of the epistle appear to agree with this conclusion. The visit to Jerusalem, mentioned in [Gal. 2:1-10](/gal#Gal.2.1), was identical with that of [Acts 15](/acts#Acts.15), and it is spoken of as a thing of the past, and consequently the epistle was written subsequently to the council of Jerusalem. The similarity between this epistle and that to the Romans has led to the conclusion that they were both written at the same time, namely, in the winter of A.D. 57-8, during Paul’s stay in Corinth ([Acts 20:2](/acts#Acts.20.2), [3](/acts#Acts.20.3)). This to the Galatians is written on the urgency of the occasion, tidings having reached him of the state of matters; and that to the Romans in a more deliberate and systematic way, in exposition of the same great doctrines of the gospel.

 Contents of. The great question discussed is, Was the Jewish law binding on Christians? The epistle is designed to prove against the Jews that men are justified by faith without the works of the law of Moses. After an introductory address ([Gal. 1:1-10](/gal#Gal.1.1)) the apostle discusses the subjects which had occasioned the epistle. (1) He defends his apostolic authority (1:11-19; 2:1-14); (2) shows the evil influence of the Judaizers in destroying the very essence of the gospel (3 and 4); (3) exhorts the Galatian believers to stand fast in the faith as it is in Jesus, and to abound in the fruits of the Spirit, and in a right use of their Christian freedom (5-6:1-10); (4) and then concludes with a summary of the topics discussed, and with the benediction.

 The Epistle to the Galatians and that to the Romans taken together “form a complete proof that justification is not to be obtained meritoriously either by works of morality or by rites and ceremonies, though of divine appointment; but that it is a free gift, proceeding entirely from the mercy of God, to those who receive it by faith in Jesus our Lord.”

 In the conclusion of the epistle (6:11) Paul says, “Ye see how large a letter I have written with mine own hand.” It is implied that this was different from his ordinary usage, which was simply to write the concluding salutation with his own hand, indicating that the rest of the epistle was written by another hand. Regarding this conclusion, Lightfoot, in his Commentary on the epistle, says: “At this point the apostle takes the pen from his amanuensis, and the concluding paragraph is written with his own hand. From the time when letters began to be forged in his name ([2 Thess. 2:2](/2thess#2Thess.2.2); [3:17](/2thess#2Thess.3.17)) it seems to have been his practice to close with a few words in his own handwriting, as a precaution against such forgeries...In the present case he writes a whole paragraph, summing up the main lessons of the epistle in terse, eager, disjointed sentences. He writes it, too, in large, bold characters (Gr. pelikois grammasin), that his hand-writing may reflect the energy and determination of his soul.”",0.0,unmatched,unmatched,,

Galilee,2223,g-p32.1,Galilee,"Circuit. Solomon rewarded Hiram for certain services rendered him by the gift of an upland plain among the mountains of Naphtali. Hiram was dissatisfied with the gift, and called it “the land of Cabul” (q.v.). The Jews called it Galil. It continued long to be occupied by the original inhabitants, and hence came to be called “Galilee of the Gentiles” ([Matt. 4:15](/matt#Matt.4.15)), and also “Upper Galilee,” to distinguish it from the extensive addition afterwards made to it toward the south, which was usually called “Lower Galilee.” In the time of our Lord, Galilee embraced more than one-third of Western Palestine, extending “from Dan on the north, at the base of Mount Hermon, to the ridges of Carmel and Gilboa on the south, and from the Jordan valley on the east away across the splendid plains of Jezreel and Acre to the shores of the Mediterranean on the west.” Palestine was divided into three provinces, Judea, Samaria, and Galilee, which comprehended the whole northern section of the country ([Acts 9:31](/acts#Acts.9.31)), and was the largest of the three.

 It was the scene of some of the most memorable events of Jewish history. Galilee also was the home of our Lord during at least thirty years of his life. The first three Gospels are chiefly taken up with our Lord’s public ministry in this province. “The entire province is encircled with a halo of holy associations connected with the life, works, and teachings of Jesus of Nazareth.” “It is noteworthy that of his thirty-two beautiful parables, no less than ninteen were spoken in Galilee. And it is no less remarkable that of his entire thirty-three great miracles, twenty-five were wrought in this province. His first miracle was wrought at the wedding in Cana of Galilee, and his last, after his resurrection, on the shore of Galilee’s sea. In Galilee our Lord delivered the Sermon on The Mount, and the discourses on ‘The Bread of Life,’ on ‘Purity,’ on ’Forgiveness,’ and on ‘Humility.’ In Galilee he called his first disciples; and there occurred the sublime scene of the Transfiguration” (Porter’s Through Samaria).

 When the Sanhedrin were about to proceed with some plan for the condemnation of our Lord ([John 7:45-52](/john#John.7.45)), Nicodemus interposed in his behalf. (Comp. [Deut. 1:16](/deut#Deut.1.16), [17](/deut#Deut.1.17); 17:8.) They replied, “Art thou also of Galilee?... Out of Galilee ariseth no prophet.” This saying of theirs was “not historically true, for two prophets at least had arisen from Galilee, Jonah of Gath-hepher, and the greatest of all the prophets, Elijah of Thisbe, and perhaps also Nahum and Hosea. Their contempt for Galilee made them lose sight of historical accuracy” (Alford, Com.).

 This lake is 12 1/2 miles long, and from 4 to 7 1/2 broad. Its surface is 682 feet below the level of the Mediterranean. Its depth is from 80 to 160 feet. The Jordan enters it 10 1/2 miles below the southern extremity of the Huleh Lake, or about 26 1/2 miles from its source. In this distance of 26 1/2 miles there is a fall in the river of 1,682 feet, or of more than 60 feet to the mile. It is 27 miles east of the Mediterranean, and about 60 miles north-east of Jerusalem. It is of an oval shape, and abounds in fish.

 Its present appearance is thus described: “The utter loneliness and absolute stillness of the scene are exceedingly impressive. It seems as if all nature had gone to rest, languishing under the scorching heat. How different it was in the days of our Lord! Then all was life and bustle along the shores; the cities and villages that thickly studded them resounded with the hum of a busy population; while from hill-side and corn-field came the cheerful cry of shepherd and ploughman. The lake, too, was dotted with dark fishing-boats and spangled with white sails. Now a mournful, solitary silence reigns over sea and shore. The cities are in ruins!”

 This sea is chiefly of interest as associated with the public ministry of our Lord. Capernaum, “his own city” ([Matt. 9:1](/matt#Matt.9.1)), stood on its shores. From among the fishermen who plied their calling on its waters he chose Peter and his brother Andrew, and James and John, to be disciples, and sent them forth to be “fishers of men” ([Matt. 4:18](/matt#Matt.4.18), [22](/matt#Matt.4.22); [Mark 1:16-20](/mark#Mark.1.16); [Luke 5](/luke#Luke.5): 1-11). He stilled its tempest, saying to the storm that swept over it, “Peace, be still” ([Matt. 8:23-27](/matt#Matt.8.23); [Mark 7:31-35](/mark#Mark.7.31)); and here also he showed himself after his resurrection to his disciples ([John 21](/john#John.21)).

 “The Sea of Galilee is indeed the cradle of the gospel. The subterranean fires of nature prepared a lake basin, through which a river afterwards ran, keeping its waters always fresh. In this basin a vast quantity of shell-fish swarmed, and multiplied to such an extent that they formed the food of an extraordinary profusion of fish. The great variety and abundance of the fish in the lake attracted to its shores a larger and more varied population than existed elsewhere in Palestine, whereby this secluded district was brought into contact with all parts of the world. And this large and varied population, with access to all nations and countries, attracted the Lord Jesus, and induced him to make this spot the centre of his public ministry.”",2.0,place,sea_of_galilee_1032,,sea_of_galilee_1032

Our Lord, knowing this, refuses to drink it. He would take nothing to cloud his faculties or blunt the pain of dying.

Genesis,2304,g-p116.4,Genesis,"The five books of Moses were collectively called the Pentateuch, a word of Greek origin meaning “the five-fold book.” The Jews called them the Torah, i.e., “the law.” It is probable that the division of the Torah into five books proceeded from the Greek translators of the Old Testament. The names by which these several books are generally known are Greek.

 The first book of the Pentateuch (q.v.) is called by the Jews Bereshith, i.e., “in the beginning”, because this is the first word of the book. It is generally known among Christians by the name of Genesis, i.e., “creation” or “generation,” being the name given to it in the LXX. as designating its character, because it gives an account of the origin of all things. It contains, according to the usual computation, the history of about two thousand three hundred and sixty-nine years.

 Genesis is divided into two principal parts. The first part (1-11) gives a general history of mankind down to the time of the Dispersion. The second part presents the early history of Israel down to the death and burial of Joseph (12-50).

 There are five principal persons brought in succession under our notice in this book, and around these persons the history of the successive periods is grouped, viz., Adam (1-3), Noah (4-9), Abraham (10-25:18), Isaac (25:19-35:29), and Jacob (36-50).

 In this book we have several prophecies concerning Christ (3:15; 12:3; 18:18; 22:18; 26:4; 28:14; 49:10). The author of this book was Moses.

It stood over against Mount Ebal, the summits of these mountains being distant from each other about 2 miles ([Deut. 27](/deut#Deut.27); [Josh. 8:30-35](/josh#Josh.8.30)). On the slopes of this mountain the tribes descended from the handmaids of Leah and Rachel, together with the tribe of Reuben, were gathered together, and gave the responses to the blessing pronounced as the reward of obedience, when Joshua in the valley below read the whole law in the hearing of all the people; as those gathered on Ebal responded with a loud Amen to the rehearsal of the curses pronounced on the disobedient. It was probably at this time that the coffin containing the embalmed body of Joseph was laid in the “parcel of ground which Jacob bought of the sons of Hamor” ([Gen. 33:19](/gen#Gen.33.19); [50:25](/gen#Gen.50.25)).

 Josephus relates (Ant. 11:8, 2-4) that Sanballat built a temple for the Samaritans on this mountain, and instituted a priesthood, as rivals to those of the Jews at Jerusalem. This temple was destroyed after it had stood two hundred years. It was afterwards rebuilt by Herod the Great. There is a Samaritan tradition that it was the scene of the incident recorded in [Gen. 22](/gen#Gen.22). There are many ruins on this mountain, some of which are evidently of Christian buildings. To this mountain the woman of Sychar referred in [John 4:20](/john#John.4.20). For centuries Gerizim was the centre of political outbreaks.

Gibeon,2344,g-p159.2,Gibeon,"Hill-city, “one of the royal cities, greater than Ai, and all the men thereof were mighty” ([Josh. 10:2](/josh#Josh.10.2)). Its inhabitants were Hivites (11:19). It lay within the territory of Benjamin, and became a priest-city (18:25; 21:17). Here the tabernacle was set up after the destruction of Nob, and here it remained many years till the temple was built by Solomon. It is represented by the modern el-Jib, to the south-west of Ai, and about 5 1/2 miles north-north-west of Jerusalem.

 A deputation of the Gibeonites, with their allies from three other cities ([Josh. 9](/josh#Josh.9);[17](/josh#Josh.17)), visited the camp at Gilgal, and by false representations induced Joshua to enter into a league with them, although the Israelites had been specially warned against any league with the inhabitants of Canaan ([Ex. 23:32](/exod#Exod.23.32); [34:12](/exod#Exod.34.12); [Num. 33:55](/num#Num.33.55); [Deut. 7:2](/deut#Deut.7.2)). The deception practised on Joshua was detected three days later; but the oath rashly sworn “by Jehovah God of Israel” was kept, and the lives of the Gibeonites were spared. They were, however, made “bondmen” to the sanctuary ([Josh. 9:23](/josh#Josh.9.23)).

 The most remarkable incident connected with this city was the victory Joshua gained over the kings of Palestine ([Josh. 10:16-27](/josh#Josh.10.16)). The battle here fought has been regarded as “one of the most important in the history of the world.” The kings of southern Canaan entered into a confederacy against Gibeon (because it had entered into a league with Joshua) under the leadership of Adoni-zedec, king of Jerusalem, and marched upon Gibeon with the view of taking possession of it. The Gibeonites entreated Joshua to come to their aid with the utmost speed. His army came suddenly upon that of the Amorite kings as it lay encamped before the city. It was completely routed, and only broken remnants of their great host found refuge in the fenced cities. The five confederate kings who led the army were taken prisoners, and put to death at Makkedah (q.v.). This eventful battle of Beth-horon sealed the fate of all the cities of Southern Palestine. Among the Amarna tablets is a letter from Adoni-zedec (q.v.) to the king of Egypt, written probably at Makkedah after the defeat, showing that the kings contemplated flight into Egypt.

 This place is again brought into notice as the scene of a battle between the army of Ish-bosheth under Abner and that of David led by Joab. At the suggestion of Abner, to spare the effusion of blood twelve men on either side were chosen to decide the battle. The issue was unexpected; for each of the men slew his fellow, and thus they all perished. The two armies then engaged in battle, in which Abner and his host were routed and put to flight ([2 Sam. 2:12-17](/2sam#2Sam.2.12)). This battle led to a virtual truce between Judah and Israel, Judah, under David, increasing in power; and Israel, under Ish-bosheth, continually losing ground.

 Soon after the death of Absalom and David’s restoration to his throne his kingdom was visited by a grievous famine, which was found to be a punishment for Saul’s violation ([2 Sam. 21:2](/2sam#2Sam.21.2), [5](/2sam#2Sam.21.5)) of the covenant with the Gibeonites ([Josh. 9:3-27](/josh#Josh.9.3)). The Gibeonites demanded blood for the wrong that had been done to them, and accordingly David gave up to them the two sons of Rizpah (q.v.) and the five sons of Michal, and these the Gibeonites took and hanged or crucified “in the hill before the Lord” ([2 Sam. 21:9](/2sam#2Sam.21.9)); and there the bodies hung for six months (21:10), and all the while Rizpah watched over the blackening corpses and “suffered neither the birds of the air to rest on them by day, nor the beasts of the field by night.” David afterwards removed the bones of Saul and Jonathan at Jabeshgilead (21:12, 13).

 Here, “at the great stone,” Amasa was put to death by Joab ([2 Sam. 20:5-10](/2sam#2Sam.20.5)). To the altar of burnt-offering which was at Gibeon, Joab ([1 Kings 2:28-34](/1kgs#1Kgs.2.28)), who had taken the side of Adonijah, fled for sanctuary in the beginning of Solomon’s reign, and was there also slain by the hand of Benaiah.

 Soon after he came to the throne, Solomon paid a visit of state to Gibeon, there to offer sacrifices ([1 Kings 3:4](/1kgs#1Kgs.3.4); [2 Chr. 1:3](/2chr#2Chr.1.3)). On this occasion the Lord appeared to him in a memorable dream, recorded in [1 Kings 3:5-15](/1kgs#1Kgs.3.5); [2 Chr. 1:7-12](/2chr#2Chr.1.7). When the temple was built “all the men of Israel assembled themselves” to king Solomon, and brought up from Gibeon the tabernacle and “all the holy vessels that were in the tabernacle” to Jerusalem, where they remained till they were carried away by Nebuchadnezzar ([2 Kings 24:13](/2kgs#2Kgs.24.13)).",0.0,place,gibeon_470,,gibeon_470
Gideon,2345,g-p166.6,Gideon,"Called also Jerubbaal ([Judg. 6:29](/judg#Judg.6.29), [32](/judg#Judg.6.32)), was the first of the judges whose history is circumstantially narrated ([Judg. 6](/judg#Judg.6)-8). His calling is the commencement of the second period in the history of the judges. After the victory gained by Deborah and Barak over Jabin, Israel once more sank into idolatry, and the Midianites (q.v.) and Amalekites, with other “children of the east,” crossed the Jordan each year for seven successive years for the purpose of plundering and desolating the land. Gideon received a direct call from God to undertake the task of delivering the land from these warlike invaders. He was of the family of Abiezer ([Josh. 17:2](/josh#Josh.17.2); [1 Chr. 7:18](/1chr#1Chr.7.18)), and of the little township of Ophrah ([Judg. 6:11](/judg#Judg.6.11)). First, with ten of his servants, he overthrew the altars of Baal and cut down the asherah which was upon it, and then blew the trumpet of alarm, and the people flocked to his standard on the crest of Mount Gilboa to the number of twenty-two thousand men. These were, however, reduced to only three hundred. These, strangely armed with torches and pitchers and trumpets, rushed in from three different points on the camp of Midian at midnight, in the valley to the north of Moreh, with the terrible war-cry, “For the Lord and for Gideon” ([Judg. 7:18](/judg#Judg.7.18), R.V.). Terror-stricken, the Midianites were put into dire confusion, and in the darkness slew one another, so that only fifteen thousand out of the great army of one hundred and twenty thousand escaped alive. The memory of this great deliverance impressed itself deeply on the mind of the nation ([1 Sam. 12:11](/1sam#1Sam.12.11); [Ps. 83:11](/ps#Ps.83.11); [Isa. 9:4](/isa#Isa.9.4); [10:26](/isa#Isa.10.26); [Heb. 11:32](/heb#Heb.11.32)). The land had now rest for forty years. Gideon died in a good old age, and was buried in the sepulchre of his fathers. Soon after his death a change came over the people. They again forgot Jehovah, and turned to the worship of Baalim, “neither shewed they kindness to the house of Jerubbaal” ([Judg. 8:35](/judg#Judg.8.35)). Gideon left behind him seventy sons, a feeble, sadly degenerated race, with one exception, that of Abimelech, who seems to have had much of the courage and energy of his father, yet of restless and unscrupulous ambition. He gathered around him a band who slaughtered all Gideon’s sons, except Jotham, upon one stone.",0.0,person,gideon_1314,gideon_1314,

But as, according to the sacred narrative, all these rivers of Eden took their origin from the head-waters of the Euphrates and the Trigris, it is probable that the Gihon is the ancient Araxes, which, under the modern name of the Arras, discharges itself into the Caspian Sea.

Gihon 2,2355,g-p174.6,Gihon,"The only natural spring of water in or near Jerusalem is the “Fountain of the Virgin” (q.v.), which rises outside the city walls on the west bank of the Kidron valley. On the occasion of the approach of the Assyrian army under Sennacherib, Hezekiah, in order to prevent the besiegers from finding water, “stopped the upper water course of Gihon, and brought it straight down to the west side of the city of David” ([2 Chr. 32:30](/2chr#2Chr.32.30); [33:14](/2chr#2Chr.33.14)). This “fountain” or spring is therefore to be regarded as the “upper water course of Gihon.” From this “fountain” a tunnel cut through the ridge which forms the south part of the temple hill conveys the water to the Pool of Siloam, which lies on the opposite side of this ridge at the head of the Tyropoeon (“cheesemakers’”) valley, or valley of the son of Hinnom, now filled up by rubbish. The length of this tunnel is about 1,750 feet. In 1880 an inscription was accidentally discovered on the wall of the tunnel about nineteen feet from where it opens into the Pool of Siloam. This inscription was executed in all probability by Hezekiah’s workmen. It briefly narrates the history of the excavation. It may, however, be possible that this tunnel was executed in the time of Solomon. If the “waters of Shiloah that go softly” ([Isa. 8:6](/isa#Isa.8.6)) refers to the gentle stream that still flows through the tunnel into the Pool of Siloam, then this excavation must have existed before the time of Hezekiah.

 In the upper part of the Tyropoeoan valley there are two pools still existing, the first, called Birket el-Mamilla, to the west of the Jaffa gate; the second, to the south of the first, called Birket es-Sultan.

The oil or resin, exuding through an orifice made in its bark in very small quantities, is esteemed of great value for its supposed medicinal qualities.

He was probably descended from the Rephaim who found refuge among the Philistines after they were dispersed by the Ammonites ([Deut. 2:20](/deut#Deut.2.20), [21](/deut#Deut.2.21)). His height was “six cubits and a span,” which, taking the cubit at 21 inches, is equal to 10 1/2 feet. David cut off his head ([1 Sam. 17:51](/1sam#1Sam.17.51)) and brought it to Jerusalem, while he hung the armour which he took from him in his tent. His sword was preserved at Nob as a religious trophy (21:9). David’s victory over Goliath was the turning point in his life.

He is generally regarded as the ancestor of the Celtae and the Cimmerii, who in early times settled to the north of the Black Sea, and gave their name to the Crimea, the ancient Chersonesus Taurica. Traces of their presence are found in the names Cimmerian Bosphorus, Cimmerian Isthmus, etc. In the seventh century B.C. they were driven out of their original seat by the Scythians, and overran western Asia Minor, whence they were afterwards expelled.

 There are four historical accounts of the person and work of Christ: “the first by Matthew, announcing the Redeemer as the promised King of the kingdom of God; the second by Mark, declaring him ‘a prophet, mighty in deed and word’; the third by Luke, of whom it might be said that he represents Christ in the special character of the Saviour of sinners ([Luke 7:36](/luke#Luke.7.36); [15:18](/luke#Luke.15.18)); the fourth by John, who represents Christ as the Son of God, in whom deity and humanity become one. The ancient Church gave to Matthew the symbol of the lion, to Mark that of a man, to Luke that of the ox, and to John that of the eagle: these were the four faces of the cherubim” ([Ezek. 1:10](/ezek#Ezek.1.10)).

 Date. The Gospels were all composed during the latter part of the first century, and there is distinct historical evidence to show that they were used and accepted as authentic before the end of the second century.

 Mutual relation. “If the extent of all the coincidences be represented by 100, their proportionate distribution will be: Matthew, Mark, and Luke, 53; Matthew and Luke, 21; Matthew and Mark, 20; Mark and Luke, 6.

When she was about to become a mother she fled from the cruelty of her mistress, intending apparently to return to her relatives in Egypt, through the desert of Shur, which lay between. Wearied and worn she had reached the place she distinguished by the name of Beer-lahai-roi (“the well of the visible God”), where the angel of the Lord appeared to her. In obedience to the heavenly visitor she returned to the tent of Abraham, where her son Ishmael was born, and where she remained (16) till after the birth of Isaac, the space of fourteen years. Sarah after this began to vent her dissatisfaction both on Hagar and her child. Ishmael’s conduct was insulting to Sarah, and she insisted that he and his mother should be dismissed. This was accordingly done, although with reluctance on the part of Abraham ([Gen. 21:14](/gen#Gen.21.14)). They wandered out into the wilderness, where Ishmael, exhausted with his journey and faint from thirst, seemed about to die. Hagar “lifted up her voice and wept,” and the angel of the Lord, as before, appeared unto her, and she was comforted and delivered out of her distresses ([Gen. 21:18](/gen#Gen.21.18), [19](/gen#Gen.21.19)).

 Elijah is called a “hairy man” ([2 Kings 1:8](/2kgs#2Kgs.1.8)) from his flowing locks, or more probably from the shaggy cloak of hair which he wore. His raiment was of camel’s hair.

 Long hair is especially noticed in the description of Absalom’s person ([2 Sam. 14:26](/2sam#2Sam.14.26)); but the wearing of long hair was unusual, and was only practised as an act of religious observance by Nazarites ([Num. 6:5](/num#Num.6.5); [Judg. 13:5](/judg#Judg.13.5)) and others in token of special mercies ([Acts 18:18](/acts#Acts.18.18)).

 Hamath, now Hamah, had an Aramaean population, but Hittite monuments discovered there show that it must have been at one time occupied by the Hittites. It was among the conquests of the Pharaoh Thothmes III. Its king, Tou or Toi, made alliance with David ([2 Sam. 8:10](/2sam#2Sam.8.10)), and in B.C. 740 Azariah formed a league with it against Assyria. It was, however, conquered by the Assyrians, and its nineteen districts placed under Assyrian governors. In B.C. 720 it revolted under a certain Yahu-bihdi, whose name, compounded with that of the God of Israel (Yahu), perhaps shows that he was of Jewish origin.

Hand,2624,h-p99.17,Hand,"Called by Galen “the instrument of instruments.” It is the symbol of human action ([Ps. 9:16](/ps#Ps.9.16); [Job 9:30](/job#Job.9.30); [Isa. 1:15](/isa#Isa.1.15); [1 Tim. 2:8](/1tim#1Tim.2.8)). Washing the hands was a symbol of innocence ([Ps. 26:6](/ps#Ps.26.6); [73:13](/ps#Ps.73.13); [Matt. 27:24](/matt#Matt.27.24)), also of sanctification ([1 Cor. 6:11](/1cor#1Cor.6.11); [Isa. 51:16](/isa#Isa.51.16); [Ps. 24:3](/ps#Ps.24.3), [4](/ps#Ps.24.4)). In [Ps. 77:2](/ps#Ps.77.2) the correct rendering is, as in the Revised Version, “My hand was stretched out,” etc., instead of, as in the Authorized Version, “My sore ran in the night,” etc.

 The right hand denoted the south, and the left the north ([Job 23:9](/job#Job.23.9); [1 Sam. 23:19](/1sam#1Sam.23.19)). To give the right hand was a pledge of fidelity ([2 Kings 10:15](/2kgs#2Kgs.10.15); [Ezra 10:19](/ezra#Ezra.10.19)); also of submission to the victors ([Ezek. 17:18](/ezek#Ezek.17.18); [Jer. 50:15](/jer#Jer.50.15)). The right hand was lifted up in taking an oath ([Gen. 14:22](/gen#Gen.14.22), etc.). The hand is frequently mentioned, particularly the right hand, as a symbol of power and strength ([Ps. 60:5](/ps#Ps.60.5); [Isa. 28:2](/isa#Isa.28.2)). To kiss the hand is an act of homage ([1 Kings 19:18](/1kgs#1Kgs.19.18); [Job 31:27](/job#Job.31.27)), and to pour water on one’s hands is to serve him ([2 Kings 3:11](/2kgs#2Kgs.3.11)). The hand of God is the symbol of his power: its being upon one denotes favour ([Ezra 7:6](/ezra#Ezra.7.6), [28](/ezra#Ezra.7.28); [Isa. 1:25](/isa#Isa.1.25); [Luke 1:66](/luke#Luke.1.66), etc.) or punishment ([Ex. 9:3](/exod#Exod.9.3); [Judg. 2:15](/judg#Judg.2.15); [Acts 13:11](/acts#Acts.13.11), etc.). A position at the right hand was regarded as the chief place of honour and power ([Ps. 45:9](/ps#Ps.45.9); [80:17](/ps#Ps.80.17); [110:1](/ps#Ps.110.1); [Matt. 26:64](/matt#Matt.26.64)).",0.0,unmatched,unmatched,,

Her home was at Ramathaim-zophim, whence she was wont every year to go to Shiloh, where the tabernacle had been pitched by Joshua, to attend the offering of sacrifices there according to the law ([Ex. 23:15](/exod#Exod.23.15); [34:18](/exod#Exod.34.18); [Deut. 16:16](/deut#Deut.16.16)), probably at the feast of the Passover (comp. [Ex. 13:10](/exod#Exod.13.10)). On occasion of one of these “yearly” visits, being grieved by reason of Peninnah’s conduct toward her, she went forth alone, and kneeling before the Lord at the sanctuary she prayed inaudibly. Eli the high priest, who sat at the entrance to the holy place, observed her, and misunderstanding her character he harshly condemned her conduct ([1 Sam. 1:14-16](/1sam#1Sam.1.14)). After hearing her explanation he retracted his injurious charge and said to her, “Go in peace: and the God of Israel grant thee thy petition.” Perhaps the story of the wife of Manoah was not unknown to her. Thereafter Elkanah and his family retired to their quiet home, and there, before another Passover, Hannah gave birth to a son, whom, in grateful memory of the Lord’s goodness, she called Samuel, i.e., “heard of God.” After the child was weaned (probably in his third year) she brought him to Shiloh into the house of the Lord, and said to Eli the aged priest, “Oh my lord, I am the woman that stood by thee here, praying unto the Lord. For this child I prayed; and the Lord hath given me my petition which I asked of him: therefore I also have granted him to the Lord; as long as he liveth he is granted to the Lord” ([1 Sam. 1:27](/1sam#1Sam.1.27), [28](/1sam#1Sam.1.28), R.V.). Her gladness of heart then found vent in that remarkable prophetic song (2:1-10; comp. [Luke 1:46-55](/luke#Luke.1.46)) which contains the first designation of the Messiah under that name ([1 Sam. 2:10](/1sam#1Sam.2.10), “Annointed” = “Messiah”). And so Samuel and his parents parted. He was left at Shiloh to minister “before the Lord.” And each year, when they came up to Shiloh, Hannah brought to her absent child “a little coat” (Heb. meil, a term used to denote the “robe” of the ephod worn by the high priest, [Ex. 28:31](/exod#Exod.28.31)), a priestly robe, a long upper tunic ([1 Chr. 15:27](/1chr#1Chr.15.27)), in which to minister in the tabernacle ([1 Sam. 2:19](/1sam#1Sam.2.19); [15:27](/1sam#1Sam.15.27); [Job 2:12](/job#Job.2.12)). “And the child Samuel grew before the Lord.” After Samuel, Hannah had three sons and two daughters.",0.0,person,hannah_1400,hannah_1400,

 It has been attempted to show that Rahab, usually called a “harlot” ([Josh. 2:1](/josh#Josh.2.1); [6:17](/josh#Josh.6.17); [Heb. 11:31](/heb#Heb.11.31); [James 2:25](/jas#Jas.2.25)), was only an innkeeper. This interpretation, however, cannot be maintained.

 Jephthah’s mother is called a “strange woman” ([Judg. 11:2](/judg#Judg.11.2)). This, however, merely denotes that she was of foreign extraction.

 In the time of Solomon harlots appeared openly in the streets, and he solemnly warns against association with them ([Prov. 7:12](/prov#Prov.7.12); [9:14](/prov#Prov.9.14).

Heart,2754,h-p201.2,Heart,"According to the Bible, the heart is the centre not only of spiritual activity, but of all the operations of human life. “Heart” and “soul” are often used interchangeably ([Deut. 6:5](/deut#Deut.6.5); [26:16](/deut#Deut.26.16); comp.

 The heart is the “home of the personal life,” and hence a man is designated, according to his heart, wise ([1 Kings 3:12](/1kgs#1Kgs.3.12), etc.), pure ([Ps. 24:4](/ps#Ps.24.4); [Matt. 5:8](/matt#Matt.5.8), etc.), upright and righteous ([Gen. 20:5](/gen#Gen.20.5), [6](/gen#Gen.20.6); [Ps. 11:2](/ps#Ps.11.2); [78:72](/ps#Ps.78.72)), pious and good ([Luke 8:15](/luke#Luke.8.15)), etc. In these and such passages the word “soul” could not be substituted for “heart.”

 The heart is also the seat of the conscience ([Rom. 2:15](/rom#Rom.2.15)). It is naturally wicked ([Gen. 8:21](/gen#Gen.8.21)), and hence it contaminates the whole life and character ([Matt. 12:34](/matt#Matt.12.34); [15:18](/matt#Matt.15.18); comp.

 The process of salvation begins in the heart by the believing reception of the testimony of God, while the rejection of that testimony hardens the heart ([Ps. 95:8](/ps#Ps.95.8); [Prov. 28:14](/prov#Prov.28.14); [2 Chr. 36:13](/2chr#2Chr.36.13)). “Hardness of heart evidences itself by light views of sin; partial acknowledgment and confession of it; pride and conceit; ingratitude; unconcern about the word and ordinances of God; inattention to divine providences; stifling convictions of conscience; shunning reproof; presumption, and general ignorance of divine things.”",0.0,unmatched,unmatched,,

The practice of idolatry was the characteristic of these nations, and hence the word came to designate idolaters ([Ps. 106:47](/ps#Ps.106.47); [Jer. 46:28](/jer#Jer.46.28); [Lam. 1:3](/lam#Lam.1.3); [Isa. 36:18](/isa#Isa.36.18)), the wicked ([Ps. 9:5](/ps#Ps.9.5), [15](/ps#Ps.9.15), [17](/ps#Ps.9.17)).

Hebrew language,2775,h-p244.2,Hebrew language,"The language of the Hebrew nation, and that in which the Old Testament is written, with the exception of a few portions in Chaldee. In the Old Testament it is only spoken of as “Jewish” ([2 Kings 18:26](/2kgs#2Kgs.18.26), [28](/2kgs#2Kgs.18.28); [Isa. 36:11](/isa#Isa.36.11), [13](/isa#Isa.36.13); [2 Chr 32:18](/2chr#2Chr.32.18)). This name is first used by the Jews in times subsequent to the close of the Old Testament.

 It is one of the class of languages called Semitic, because they were chiefly spoken among the descendants of Shem.

 When Abraham entered Canaan it is obvious that he found the language of its inhabitants closely allied to his own. Isaiah (19:18) calls it “the language of Canaan.” Whether this language, as seen in the earliest books of the Old Testament, was the very dialect which Abraham brought with him into Canaan, or whether it was the common tongue of the Canaanitish nations which he only adopted, is uncertain; probably the latter opinion is the correct one. For the thousand years between Moses and the Babylonian exile the Hebrew language underwent little or no modification. It preserves all through a remarkable uniformity of structure. From the first it appears in its full maturity of development. But through intercourse with Damascus, Assyria, and Babylon, from the time of David, and more particularly from the period of the Exile, it comes under the influence of the Aramaic idiom, and this is seen in the writings which date from this period. It was never spoken in its purity by the Jews after their return from Babylon. They now spoke Hebrew with a large admixture of Aramaic or Chaldee, which latterly became the predominant element in the national language.

 The Hebrew of the Old Testament has only about six thousand words, all derived from about five hundred roots. Hence the same word has sometimes a great variety of meanings. So long as it was a living language, and for ages after, only the consonants of the words were written. This also has been a source of difficulty in interpreting certain words, for the meaning varies according to the vowels which may be supplied. The Hebrew is one of the oldest languages of which we have any knowledge. It is essentially identical with the Phoenician language. The Semitic languages, to which class the Hebrew and Phoenician belonged, were spoken over a very wide area: in Babylonia, Mesopotamia, Syria, Palestine and Arabia, in all the countries from the Mediterranean to the borders of Assyria, and from the mountains of Armenia to the Indian Ocean. The rounded form of the letters, as seen in the Moabite stone, was probably that in which the ancient Hebrew was written down to the time of the Exile, when the present square or Chaldean form was adopted.",0.0,unmatched,unmatched,,

Hebron 1,2786,h-p256.1,Hebron,"A city in the south end of the valley of Eshcol, about midway between Jerusalem and Beersheba, from which it is distant about 20 miles in a straight line. It was built “seven years before Zoan in Egypt” ([Gen. 13:18](/gen#Gen.13.18); [Num. 13:22](/num#Num.13.22)). It still exists under the same name, and is one of the most ancient cities in the world. Its earlier name was Kirjath-arba ([Gen. 23:2](/gen#Gen.23.2); [Josh. 14:15](/josh#Josh.14.15); [15:3](/josh#Josh.15.3)). But “Hebron would appear to have been the original name of the city, and it was not till after Abraham’s stay there that it received the name Kirjath-arba, who [i.e., Arba] was not the founder but the conqueror of the city, having led thither the tribe of the Anakim, to which he belonged. It retained this name till it came into the possession of Caleb, when the Israelites restored the original name Hebron” (Keil, Com.). The name of this city does not occur in any of the prophets or in the New Testament. It is found about forty times in the Old. It was the favorite home of Abraham. Here he pitched his tent under the oaks of Mamre, by which name it came afterwards to be known; and here Sarah died, and was buried in the cave of Machpelah ([Gen. 23:17-20](/gen#Gen.23.17)), which he bought from Ephron the Hittite. From this place the patriarch departed for Egypt by way of Beersheba (37:14; 46:1). It was taken by Joshua and given to Caleb ([Josh. 10:36](/josh#Josh.10.36), [37](/josh#Josh.10.37); 12:10; 14:13). It became a Levitical city and a city of refuge (20:7; 21:11). When David became king of Judah this was his royal residence, and he resided here for seven and a half years ([2 Sam. 5:5](/2sam#2Sam.5.5)); and here he was anointed as king over all Israel ([2 Sam. 2:1-4](/2sam#2Sam.2.1), [11](/2sam#2Sam.2.11); [1 Kings 2:11](/1kgs#1Kgs.2.11)). It became the residence also of the rebellious Absalom ([2 Sam. 15:10](/2sam#2Sam.15.10)), who probably expected to find his chief support in the tribe of Judah, now called el-Khulil.

 In one part of the modern city is a great mosque, which is built over the grave of Machpelah. The first European who was permitted to enter this mosque was the Prince of Wales in 1862. It was also visited by the Marquis of Bute in 1866, and by the late Emperor Frederick of Germany (then Crown-Prince of Prussia) in 1869.

 One of the largest oaks in Palestine is found in the valley of Eshcol, about 3 miles north of the town. It is supposed by some to be the tree under which Abraham pitched his tent, and is called “Abraham’s oak.”",1.0,place,hebron_551,,hebron_551

Joab had the command of David’s army of trained men, who encamped on the south of the pool, which was on the east of the hill on which the town of Gibeon was built, while Abner’s army lay on the north of the pool. Abner proposed that the conflict should be decided by twelve young men engaging in personal combat on either side. So fiercely did they encounter each other that “they caught every man his fellow by the head, and thrust his sword in his fellow’s side; so they fell down together: wherefore that place was called Helkath-hazzurim.” The combat of the champions was thus indecisive, and there followed a severe general engagement between the two armies, ending in the total rout of the Israelites under Abner. The general result of this battle was that “David waxed stronger and stronger, and the house of Saul waxed weaker and weaker” ([2 Sam. 3:1](/2sam#2Sam.3.1)).",0.0,place,helkath-hazzurim_559,,helkath-hazzurim_559

Hell 1,2813,h-p283.4,Hell,"Sheol, occurring in the Old Testament sixty-five times. This word sheol is derived from a root-word meaning “to ask,” “demand;” hence insatiableness ([Prov. 30:15](/prov#Prov.30.15), [16](/prov#Prov.30.16)). It is rendered “grave” thirty-one times ([Gen. 37:35](/gen#Gen.37.35); [42:38](/gen#Gen.42.38); [44:29](/gen#Gen.44.29), [31](/gen#Gen.44.31); [1 Sam. 2:6](/1sam#1Sam.2.6), etc.). The Revisers have retained this rendering in the historical books with the original word in the margin, while in the poetical books they have reversed this rule.

 In thirty-one cases in the Authorized Version this word is rendered “hell,” the place of disembodied spirits. The inhabitants of sheol are “the congregation of the dead” ([Prov. 21:16](/prov#Prov.21.16)). It is (a) the abode of the wicked ([Num. 16:33](/num#Num.16.33); [Job 24:19](/job#Job.24.19); [Ps. 9:17](/ps#Ps.9.17); [31:17](/ps#Ps.31.17), etc.); (b) of the good ([Ps. 16:10](/ps#Ps.16.10); [30:3](/ps#Ps.30.3); [49:15](/ps#Ps.49.15); [86:13](/ps#Ps.86.13), etc.).

 He was of a stern and cruel disposition. “He was brutish and a stranger to all humanity.” Alarmed by the tidings of one “born King of the Jews,” he sent forth and “slew all the children that were in Bethlehem, and in all the coasts thereof, from two years old and under” ([Matt. 2:16](/matt#Matt.2.16)). He was fond of splendour, and lavished great sums in rebuilding and adorning the cities of his empire. He rebuilt the city of Caesarea (q.v.) on the coast, and also the city of Samaria (q.v.), which he called Sebaste, in honour of Augustus. He restored the ruined temple of Jerusalem, a work which was begun B.C. 20, but was not finished till after Herod’s death, probably not till about A.D. 50 ([John 2:20](/john#John.2.20)). After a troubled reign of thirty-seven years, he died at Jericho amid great agonies both of body and mind, B.C. 4, i.e., according to the common chronology, in the year in which Jesus was born.

 After his death his kingdom was divided among three of his sons. Of these, Philip had the land east of Jordan, between Caesarea Philippi and Bethabara, Antipas had Galilee and Peraea, while Archelaus had Judea and Samaria.",0.0,unmatched,unmatched,,

He reigned twenty-nine years (B.C. 726-697). The history of this king is contained in [2 Kings 18:20](/2kgs#2Kgs.18.20), [Isa. 36](/isa#Isa.36)-39, and [2 Chr. 29](/2chr#2Chr.29)-32. He is spoken of as a great and good king. In public life he followed the example of his great-granfather Uzziah. He set himself to abolish idolatry from his kingdom, and among other things which he did for this end, he destroyed the “brazen serpent,” which had been removed to Jerusalem, and had become an object of idolatrous worship ([Num. 21:9](/num#Num.21.9)). A great reformation was wrought in the kingdom of Judah in his day ([2 Kings 18:4](/2kgs#2Kgs.18.4); [2 Chr. 29:3-36](/2chr#2Chr.29.3)).

 On the death of Sargon and the accession of his son Sennacherib to the throne of Assyria, Hezekiah refused to pay the tribute which his father had paid, and “rebelled against the king of Assyria, and served him not,” but entered into a league with Egypt ([Isa. 30](/isa#Isa.30); [31](/isa#Isa.31); [36:6-9](/isa#Isa.36.6)). This led to the invasion of Judah by Sennacherib ([2 Kings 18:13-16](/2kgs#2Kgs.18.13)), who took forty cities, and besieged Jerusalem with mounds. Hezekiah yielded to the demands of the Assyrian king, and agreed to pay him three hundred talents of silver and thirty of gold (18:14).

 But Sennacherib dealt treacherously with Hezekiah ([Isa. 33:1](/isa#Isa.33.1)), and a second time within two years invaded his kingdom ([2 Kings 18:17](/2kgs#2Kgs.18.17); [2 Chr. 32:9](/2chr#2Chr.32.9); [Isa. 36](/isa#Isa.36)). This invasion issued in the destruction of Sennacherib’s army. Hezekiah prayed to God, and “that night the angel of the Lord went out, and smote in the camp of the Assyrians 185,000 men.” Sennacherib fled with the shattered remnant of his forces to Nineveh, where, seventeen years after, he was assassinated by his sons Adrammelech and Sharezer ([2 Kings 19:37](/2kgs#2Kgs.19.37)).

 The narrative of Hezekiah’s sickness and miraculous recovery is found in [2 Kings 20:1](/2kgs#2Kgs.20.1), [2](/2kgs#2Kgs.20.2) Chr. 32:24, [Isa. 38:1](/isa#Isa.38.1).

He closed his days in peace and prosperity, and was succeeded by his son Manasseh. He was buried in the “chiefest of the sepulchres of the sons of David” ([2 Chr. 32:27-33](/2chr#2Chr.32.27)).

Wearing his gorgeous priestly vestments, he entered the temple before all the people, and then, laying them aside and assuming only his linen garments in secret, he entered the holy of holies alone, and made expiation, sprinkling the blood of the sin offering on the mercy seat, and offering up incense. Then resuming his splendid robes, he reappeared before the people ([Lev. 16](/lev#Lev.16)). Thus the wearing of these robes came to be identified with the Day of Atonement.

 The office, dress, and ministration of the high priest were typical of the priesthood of our Lord ([Heb. 4:14](/heb#Heb.4.14); [7:25](/heb#Heb.7.25); [9:12](/heb#Heb.9.12), etc.).

It had been the place where the idolatrous Jews burned their children alive to Moloch and Baal. A particular part of the valley was called Tophet, or the “fire-stove,” where the children were burned. After the Exile, in order to show their abhorrence of the locality, the Jews made this valley the receptacle of the offal of the city, for the destruction of which a fire was, as is supposed, kept constantly burning there.

 The Jews associated with this valley these two ideas, (1) that of the sufferings of the victims that had there been sacrificed; and (2) that of filth and corruption. It became thus to the popular mind a symbol of the abode of the wicked hereafter. It came to signify hell as the place of the wicked. “It might be shown by infinite examples that the Jews expressed hell, or the place of the damned, by this word. The word Gehenna [the Greek contraction of Hinnom] was never used in the time of Christ in any other sense than to denote the place of future punishment.” About this fact there can be no question. In this sense the word is used eleven times in our Lord’s discourses ([Matt. 23:33](/matt#Matt.23.33); [Luke 12:5](/luke#Luke.12.5); [Matt. 5:22](/matt#Matt.5.22), etc.).",0.0,place,valley_of_hinnom_1207,,valley_of_hinnom_1207

Hittites 3,2922,h-p383.3,Hittites,"the Hittites, who were the warlike element of this confederation of tribes. They inhabited the whole region between the Euphrates and Damascus, their chief cities being Carchemish on the Euphrates, and Kadesh, now Tell Neby Mendeh, in the Orontes valley, about six miles south of the Lake of Homs. These Hittites seem to have risen to great power as a nation, as for a long time they were formidable rivals of the Egyptian and Assyrian empires. In the book of Joshua they always appear as the dominant race to the north of Galilee.

 Somewhere about the twenty-third century B.C. the Syrian confederation, led probably by the Hittites, arched against Lower Egypt, which they took possession of, making Zoan their capital. Their rulers were the Hyksos, or shepherd kings. They were at length finally driven out of Egypt. Rameses II. sought vengeance against the “vile Kheta,” as he called them, and encountered and defeated them in the great battle of Kadesh, four centuries after Abraham.

 They are first referred to in Scripture in the history of Abraham, who bought from Ephron the Hittite the field and the cave of Machpelah ([Gen. 15:20](/gen#Gen.15.20): 23:3-18). They were then settled at Kirjath-arba. From this tribe Esau took his first two wives (26:34; 36:2).

 They are afterwards mentioned in the usual way among the inhabitants of the Promised Land ([Ex. 23:28](/exod#Exod.23.28)). They were closely allied to the Amorites, and are frequently mentioned along with them as inhabiting the mountains of Palestine. When the spies entered the land they seem to have occupied with the Amorites the mountain region of Judah ([Num. 13:29](/num#Num.13.29)). They took part with the other Canaanites against the Israelites ([Josh. 9:1](/josh#Josh.9.1); [11:3](/josh#Josh.11.3)).

 After this there are few references to them in Scripture. Mention is made of “Ahimelech the Hittite” ([1 Sam. 26:6](/1sam#1Sam.26.6)), and of “Uriah the Hittite,” one of David’s chief officers ([2 Sam. 23:39](/2sam#2Sam.23.39); [1 Chr. 11:41](/1chr#1Chr.11.41)). In the days of Solomon they were a powerful confederation in the north of Syria, and were ruled by “kings.” They are met with after the Exile still a distinct people ([Ezra 9:1](/ezra#Ezra.9.1); comp. [Neh. 13:23-28](/neh#Neh.13.23)).

 The Hebrew merchants exported horses from Egypt not only for the kings of Israel, but also for the Hittites ([1 Kings 10:28](/1kgs#1Kgs.10.28), [29](/1kgs#1Kgs.10.29)). From the Egyptian monuments we learn that “the Hittites were a people with yellow skins and ‘Mongoloid’ features, whose receding foreheads, oblique eyes, and protruding upper jaws are represented as faithfully on their own monuments as they are on those of Egypt, so that we cannot accuse the Egyptian artists of caricaturing their enemies. The Amorites, on the contrary, were a tall and handsome people. They are depicted with white skins, blue eyes, and reddish hair, all the characteristics, in fact, of the white race” (Sayce’s The Hittites).

Hivites,2923,h-p389.3,Hivites,"One of the original tribes scattered over Palestine, from Hermon to Gibeon in the south.

At the time of Jacob’s return to Canaan, Hamor the Hivite was the “prince of the land” ([Gen. 24:2-28](/gen#Gen.24.2)).

 They are next mentioned during the Conquest ([Josh. 9:7](/josh#Josh.9.7); [11:19](/josh#Josh.11.19)). They principally inhabited the northern confines of Western Palestine ([Josh. 11:3](/josh#Josh.11.3); [Judg. 3:3](/judg#Judg.3.3)).

In [Rom. 5:2](/rom#Rom.5.2) the “hope” spoken of is probably objective, i.e., “the hope set before us,” namely, eternal life (comp. 12:12).

Hormah,2964,h-p431.6,Hormah,"Banning; i.e., placing under a “ban,” or devoting to utter destruction. After the manifestation of God’s anger against the Israelites, on account of their rebellion and their murmurings when the spies returned to the camp at Kadesh, in the wilderness of Paran, with an evil report of the land, they quickly repented of their conduct, and presumed to go up “to the head of the mountain,” seeking to enter the Promised Land, but without the presence of the Lord, without the ark of the convenant, and without Moses. The Amalekites and the Canaanites came down and “smote and discomfited them even unto Hormah” ([Num. 14:45](/num#Num.14.45)). This place, or perhaps the watch-tower commanding it, was originally called Zephath ([Judg. 1:17](/judg#Judg.1.17)), the modern Sebaiteh. Afterwards ([Num. 21:1-3](/num#Num.21.1)) Arad, the king of the Canaanites, at the close of the wanderings, when the Israelites were a second time encamped at Kadesh, “fought against them, and took some of them prisoners.” But Israel vowed a vow unto the Lord utterly to destroy the cities of the Canaanites; they “banned” them, and hence the place was now called Hormah. But this “ban” was not fully executed till the time of Joshua, who finally conquered the king of this district, so that the ancient name Zephath became “Hormah” ([Josh. 12:14](/josh#Josh.12.14); [Judg. 1:17](/judg#Judg.1.17)).",0.0,place,hormah_580,,hormah_580
Horn,2965,h-p432.6,Horn,"Trumpets were at first horns perforated at the tip, used for various purposes ([Josh. 6:4](/josh#Josh.6.4), [5](/josh#Josh.6.5)).

 Flasks or vessels were made of horn ([1 Sam. 16:1](/1sam#1Sam.16.1), [13](/1sam#1Sam.16.13); [1 Kings 1:39](/1kgs#1Kgs.1.39)).

 But the word is used also metaphorically to denote the projecting corners of the altar of burnt offerings ([Ex. 27:2](/exod#Exod.27.2)) and of incense (30:2). The horns of the altar of burnt offerings were to be smeared with the blood of the slain bullock (29:12; [Lev. 4:7-18](/lev#Lev.4.7)). The criminal, when his crime was accidental, found an asylum by laying hold of the horns of the altar ([1 Kings 1:50](/1kgs#1Kgs.1.50); [2:28](/1kgs#1Kgs.2.28)).

 The word also denotes the peak or summit of a hill ([Isa. 5:1](/isa#Isa.5.1), where the word “hill” is the rendering of the same Hebrew word).

 This word is used metaphorically also for strength ([Deut. 33:17](/deut#Deut.33.17)) and honour ([Job 16:15](/job#Job.16.15); [Lam. 2:3](/lam#Lam.2.3)). Horns are emblems of power, dominion, glory, and fierceness, as they are the chief means of attack and defence with the animals endowed with them ([Dan. 8:5](/dan#Dan.8.5), [9](/dan#Dan.8.9); [1 Sam. 2:1](/1sam#1Sam.2.1); [16:1](/1sam#1Sam.16.1), [13](/1sam#1Sam.16.13); [1 Kings 1:39](/1kgs#1Kgs.1.39); [22:11](/1kgs#1Kgs.22.11); [Josh. 6:4](/josh#Josh.6.4), [5](/josh#Josh.6.5); [Ps. 75:5](/ps#Ps.75.5), [10](/ps#Ps.75.10); 132:17; [Luke 1:69](/luke#Luke.1.69), etc.). The expression “horn of salvation,” applied to Christ, means a salvation of strength, or a strong Saviour ([Luke 1:69](/luke#Luke.1.69)). To have the horn “exalted” denotes prosperity and triumph ([Ps. 89:17](/ps#Ps.89.17), [24](/ps#Ps.89.24)). To “lift up” the horn is to act proudly ([Zech. 1:21](/zech#Zech.1.21)).

 Horns are also the symbol of royal dignity and power ([Jer. 48:25](/jer#Jer.48.25); [Zech. 1:18](/zech#Zech.1.18); [Dan. 8:24](/dan#Dan.8.24)).",0.0,unmatched,unmatched,,

The word is used in these passages as referring to some means by which the Canaanites were to be driven out from before the Israelites. Some have supposed that the word is used in a metaphorical sense as the symbol of some panic which would seize the people as a “terror of God” ([Gen. 35:5](/gen#Gen.35.5)), the consternation with which God would inspire the Canaanites. In Palestine there are four species of hornets, differing from our hornets, being larger in size, and they are very abundant.

Hosea prophesied in a dark and melancholy period of Israel’s history, the period of Israel’s decline and fall. Their sins had brought upon them great national disasters. “Their homicides and fornication, their perjury and theft, their idolatry and impiety, are censured and satirized with a faithful severity.” He was a contemporary of Isaiah. The book may be divided into two parts, the first containing chapters 1-3, and symbolically representing the idolatry of Israel under imagery borrowed from the matrimonial relation. The figures of marriage and adultery are common in the Old Testament writings to represent the spiritual relations between Jehovah and the people of Israel. Here we see the apostasy of Israel and their punishment, with their future repentance, forgiveness, and restoration.

 The second part, containing 4-14, is a summary of Hosea’s discourses, filled with denunciations, threatenings, exhortations, promises, and revelations of mercy.

 Quotations from Hosea are found in [Matt. 2:15](/matt#Matt.2.15); [9:15](/matt#Matt.9.15); [12:7](/matt#Matt.12.7); [Rom. 9:25](/rom#Rom.9.25), [26](/rom#Rom.9.26).

 In Scripture, idolatry is regarded as of heathen origin, and as being imported among the Hebrews through contact with heathen nations. The first allusion to idolatry is in the account of Rachel stealing her father’s teraphim ([Gen. 31:19](/gen#Gen.31.19)), which were the relics of the worship of other gods by Laban’s progenitors “on the other side of the river in old time” ([Josh. 24:2](/josh#Josh.24.2)). During their long residence in Egypt the Hebrews fell into idolatry, and it was long before they were delivered from it ([Josh. 24:14](/josh#Josh.24.14); [Ezek. 20:7](/ezek#Ezek.20.7)). Many a token of God’s displeasure fell upon them because of this sin.

 The idolatry learned in Egypt was probably rooted out from among the people during the forty years’ wanderings; but when the Jews entered Palestine, they came into contact with the monuments and associations of the idolatry of the old Canaanitish races, and showed a constant tendency to depart from the living God and follow the idolatrous practices of those heathen nations. It was their great national sin, which was only effectually rebuked by the Babylonian exile. That exile finally purified the Jews of all idolatrous tendencies.

 The first and second commandments are directed against idolatry of every form. Individuals and communities were equally amenable to the rigorous code. The individual offender was devoted to destruction ([Ex. 22:20](/exod#Exod.22.20)). His nearest relatives were not only bound to denounce him and deliver him up to punishment ([Deut. 13:20-10](/deut#Deut.13.20)), but their hands were to strike the first blow when, on the evidence of two witnesses at least, he was stoned ([Deut. 17:2-7](/deut#Deut.17.2)). To attempt to seduce others to false worship was a crime of equal enormity (13:6-10). An idolatrous nation shared the same fate. No facts are more strongly declared in the Old Testament than that the extermination of the Canaanites was the punishment of their idolatry ([Ex. 34:15](/exod#Exod.34.15), [16](/exod#Exod.34.16); [Deut. 7](/deut#Deut.7); [12:29-31](/deut#Deut.12.29); [20:17](/deut#Deut.20.17)), and that the calamities of the Israelites were due to the same cause ([Jer. 2:17](/jer#Jer.2.17)). “A city guilty of idolatry was looked upon as a cancer in the state; it was considered to be in rebellion, and treated according to the laws of war. Its inhabitants and all their cattle were put to death.” Jehovah was the theocratic King of Israel, the civil Head of the commonwealth, and therefore to an Israelite idolatry was a state offence ([1 Sam. 15:23](/1sam#1Sam.15.23)), high treason. On taking possession of the land, the Jews were commanded to destroy all traces of every kind of the existing idolatry of the Canaanites ([Ex. 23:24](/exod#Exod.23.24), [32](/exod#Exod.23.32); 34:13; [Deut. 7:5](/deut#Deut.7.5), [25](/deut#Deut.7.25); 12:1-3).

 In the New Testament the term idolatry is used to designate covetousness ([Matt. 6:24](/matt#Matt.6.24); [Luke 16:13](/luke#Luke.16.13); [Col. 3:5](/col#Col.3.5); [Eph. 5:5](/eph#Eph.5.5)).",3.0,unmatched,unmatched,,

The testimony of the sacred writers themselves abundantly demonstrates this truth; and if they are infallible as teachers of doctrine, then the doctrine of plenary inspiration must be accepted. There are no errors in the Bible as it came from God, none have been proved to exist. Difficulties and phenomena we cannot explain are not errors.

Intercession of Christ,3073,i-p61.3,Intercession of Christ,"Christ’s priestly office consists of these two parts, (1) the offering up of himself as a sacrifice, and (2) making continual intercession for us.

 His advocacy with the Father for his people rests on the basis of his own all-perfect sacrifice.

 The next memorable event in his life is that connected with the command of God given to Abraham to offer him up as a sacrifice on a mountain in the land of Moriah ([Gen. 22](/gen#Gen.22)). When he was forty years of age Rebekah was chosen for his wife ([Gen. 24](/gen#Gen.24)).

 In consequence of a famine ([Gen. 26:1](/gen#Gen.26.1)) Isaac went to Gerar, where he practised deception as to his relation to Rebekah, imitating the conduct of his father in Egypt (12:12-20) and in Gerar (20:2). The Philistine king rebuked him for his prevarication.

 After sojourning for some time in the land of the Philistines, he returned to Beersheba, where God gave him fresh assurance of covenant blessing, and where Abimelech entered into a covenant of peace with him.

 The next chief event in his life was the blessing of his sons ([Gen. 27:1](/gen#Gen.27.1)). He died at Mamre, “being old and full of days” (35:27-29), one hundred and eighty years old, and was buried in the cave of Machpelah.

 In the New Testament reference is made to his having been “offered up” by his father ([Heb. 11:17](/heb#Heb.11.17); [James 2:21](/jas#Jas.2.21)), and to his blessing his sons ([Heb. 11:20](/heb#Heb.11.20)). As the child of promise, he is contrasted with Ishmael ([Rom. 9:7](/rom#Rom.9.7), [10](/rom#Rom.9.10); [Gal. 4:28](/gal#Gal.4.28); [Heb. 11:18](/heb#Heb.11.18)).

 Isaac is “at once a counterpart of his father in simple devoutness and purity of life, and a contrast in his passive weakness of character, which in part, at least, may have sprung from his relations to his mother and wife. After the expulsion of Ishmael and Hagar, Isaac had no competitor, and grew up in the shade of Sarah’s tent, moulded into feminine softness by habitual submission to her strong, loving will.” His life was so quiet and uneventful that it was spent “within the circle of a few miles; so guileless that he let Jacob overreach him rather than disbelieve his assurance; so tender that his mother’s death was the poignant sorrow of years; so patient and gentle that peace with his neighbours was dearer than even such a coveted possession as a well of living water dug by his own men; so grandly obedient that he put his life at his father’s disposal; so firm in his reliance on God that his greatest concern through life was to honour the divine promise given to his race.”, Geikie’s Hours, etc.",1.0,person,isaac_616,isaac_616,

Isaiah 1,3088,i-p84.1,Isaiah,"The son of Amoz ([Isa. 1:1](/isa#Isa.1.1); [2:1](/isa#Isa.2.1)), who was apparently a man of humble rank. His wife was called “the prophetess” (8:3), either because she was endowed with the prophetic gift, like Deborah ([Judg. 4:4](/judg#Judg.4.4)) and Huldah ([2 Kings 22:14-20](/2kgs#2Kgs.22.14)), or simply because she was the wife of “the prophet” ([Isa. 38:1](/isa#Isa.38.1)). He had two sons, who bore symbolical names.

 He exercised the functions of his office during the reigns of Uzziah (or Azariah), Jotham, Ahaz, and Hezekiah (1:1). Uzziah reigned fifty-two years (B.C. 810-759), and Isaiah must have begun his career a few years before Uzziah’s death, probably B.C. 762. He lived till the fourteenth year of Hezekiah, and in all likelihood outlived that monarch (who died B.C. 698), and may have been contemporary for some years with Manasseh. Thus Isaiah may have prophesied for the long period of at least sixty-four years.

 His first call to the prophetical office is not recorded. A second call came to him “in the year that King Uzziah died” ([Isa. 6:1](/isa#Isa.6.1)). He exercised his ministry in a spirit of uncompromising firmness and boldness in regard to all that bore on the interests of religion. He conceals nothing and keeps nothing back from fear of man. He was also noted for his spirituality and for his deep-toned reverence toward “the holy One of Israel.”

 In early youth Isaiah must have been moved by the invasion of Israel by the Assyrian monarch Pul (q.v.), [2 Kings 15:19](/2kgs#2Kgs.15.19); and again, twenty years later, when he had already entered on his office, by the invasion of Tiglath-pileser and his career of conquest. Ahaz, king of Judah, at this crisis refused to co-operate with the kings of Israel and Syria in opposition to the Assyrians, and was on that account attacked and defeated by Rezin of Damascus and Pekah of Samaria ([2 Kings 16:5](/2kgs#2Kgs.16.5); [2 Chr. 28:5](/2chr#2Chr.28.5), [6](/2chr#2Chr.28.6)). Ahaz, thus humbled, sided with Assyria, and sought the aid of Tiglath-pileser against Israel and Syria. The consequence was that Rezin and Pekah were conquered and many of the people carried captive to Assyria ([2 Kings 15:29](/2kgs#2Kgs.15.29); [16:9](/2kgs#2Kgs.16.9); [1 Chr. 5:26](/1chr#1Chr.5.26)). Soon after this Shalmaneser determined wholly to subdue the kingdom of Israel. Samaria was taken and destroyed (B.C. 722). So long as Ahaz reigned, the kingdom of Judah was unmolested by the Assyrian power; but on his accession to the throne, Hezekiah (B.C. 726), who “rebelled against the king of Assyria” ([2 Kings 18:7](/2kgs#2Kgs.18.7)), in which he was encouraged by Isaiah, who exhorted the people to place all their dependence on Jehovah ([Isa. 10:24](/isa#Isa.10.24); [37:6](/isa#Isa.37.6)), entered into an alliance with the king of Egypt ([Isa. 30:2-4](/isa#Isa.30.2)). This led the king of Assyria to threaten the king of Judah, and at length to invade the land. Sennacherib (B.C. 701) led a powerful army into Palestine. Hezekiah was reduced to despair, and submitted to the Assyrians ([2 Kings 18:14-16](/2kgs#2Kgs.18.14)). But after a brief interval war broke out again, and again Sennacherib (q.v.) led an army into Palestine, one detachment of which threatened Jerusalem ([Isa. 36:2-22](/isa#Isa.36.2); [37:8](/isa#Isa.37.8)). Isaiah on that occasion encouraged Hezekiah to resist the Assyrians (37:1-7), whereupon Sennacherib sent a threatening letter to Hezekiah, which he “spread before the Lord” (37:14). The judgement of God now fell on the Assyrian host. “Like Xerxes in Greece, Sennacherib never recovered from the shock of the disaster in Judah. He made no more expeditions against either Southern Palestine or Egypt.” The remaining years of Hezekiah’s reign were peaceful ([2 Chr. 32:23](/2chr#2Chr.32.23), [27](/2chr#2Chr.32.27)-29). Isaiah probably lived to its close, and possibly into the reign of Manasseh, but the time and manner of his death are unknown. There is a tradition that he suffered martyrdom in the heathen reaction in the time of Manasseh (q.v.).",1.0,person,isaiah_617,"asahiah_324,isaiah_617",

This theory was originated by Koppe, a German writer at the close of the last century. There are other portions of the book also (e.g., ch. 13; 24-27; and certain verses in ch. 14 and 21) which they attribute to some other prophet than Isaiah.

"Isaiah, The Book of 5",3098,i-p90.4,"Isaiah, The Book of","It is alleged that the prophet takes the time of the Captivity as his standpoint, and speaks of it as then present; and (3) that there is such a difference between the style and language of the closing section (40-66) and those of the preceding chapters as to necessitate a different authorship, and lead to the conclusion that there were at least two Isaiahs. But even granting the fact of a great diversity of style and language, this will not necessitate the conclusion attempted to be drawn from it. The diversity of subjects treated of and the peculiarities of the prophet’s position at the time the prophecies were uttered will sufficiently account for this.

 The arguments in favour of the unity of the book are quite conclusive. When the LXX. version was made (about B.C. 250) the entire contents of the book were ascribed to Isaiah, the son of Amoz. It is not called in question, moreover, that in the time of our Lord the book existed in the form in which we now have it. Many prophecies in the disputed portions are quoted in the New Testament as the words of Isaiah ([Matt. 3:3](/matt#Matt.3.3); [Luke 3:4-6](/luke#Luke.3.4); [4:16-41](/luke#Luke.4.16); [John 12:38](/john#John.12.38); [Acts 8:28](/acts#Acts.8.28); [Rom. 10:16-21](/rom#Rom.10.16)). Universal and persistent tradition has ascribed the whole book to one author.

 Besides this, the internal evidence, the similarity in the language and style, in the thoughts and images and rhetorical ornaments, all points to the same conclusion; and its local colouring and allusions show that it is obviously of Palestinian origin. The theory therefore of a double authorship of the book, much less of a manifold authorship, cannot be maintained.

He was born at Mamre, when Abraham was eighty-six years of age, eleven years after his arrival in Canaan (16:3; 21:5). At the age of thirteen he was circumcised (17:25). He grew up a true child of the desert, wild and wayward. On the occasion of the weaning of Isaac his rude and wayward spirit broke out in expressions of insult and mockery (21:9, 10); and Sarah, discovering this, said to Abraham, “Expel this slave and her son.” Influenced by a divine admonition, Abraham dismissed Hagar and her son with no more than a skin of water and some bread. The narrative describing this act is one of the most beautiful and touching incidents of patriarchal life ([Gen. 21:14-16](/gen#Gen.21.14)).

 Ishmael settled in the land of Paran, a region lying between Canaan and the mountains of Sinai; and “God was with him, and he became a great archer” ([Gen. 21:9-21](/gen#Gen.21.9)). He became a great desert chief, but of his history little is recorded. He was about ninety years of age when his father Abraham died, in connection with whose burial he once more for a moment reappears. On this occasion the two brothers met after being long separated. “Isaac with his hundreds of household slaves, Ishmael with his troops of wild retainers and half-savage allies, in all the state of a Bedouin prince, gathered before the cave of Machpelah, in the midst of the men of Heth, to pay the last duties to the ‘father of the faithful,’ would make a notable subject for an artist” ([Gen. 25:9](/gen#Gen.25.9)).

Soon after the death of Solomon, Ahijah’s prophecy ([1 Kings 11:31-35](/1kgs#1Kgs.11.31)) was fulfilled, and the kingdom was rent in twain. Rehoboam, the son and successor of Solomon, was scarcely seated on his throne when the old jealousies between Judah and the other tribes broke out anew, and Jeroboam was sent for from Egypt by the malcontents (12:2, 3). Rehoboam insolently refused to lighten the burdensome taxation and services which his father had imposed on his subjects (12:4), and the rebellion became complete. Ephraim and all Israel raised the old cry, “Every man to his tents, O Israel” ([2 Sam. 20:1](/2sam#2Sam.20.1)). Rehoboam fled to Jerusalem ([1 Kings 12:1-18](/1kgs#1Kgs.12.1); [2 Chr. 10](/2chr#2Chr.10)), and Jeroboam was proclaimed king over all Israel at Shechem, Judah and Benjamin remaining faithful to Solomon’s son. War, with varying success, was carried on between the two kingdoms for about sixty years, till Jehoshaphat entered into an alliance with the house of Ahab.

 Extent of the kingdom. In the time of Solomon the area of Palestine, excluding the Phoenician territories on the shore of the Mediterranean, did not much exceed 13,000 square miles. The kingdom of Israel comprehended about 9,375 square miles. Shechem was the first capital of this kingdom ([1 Kings 12:25](/1kgs#1Kgs.12.25)), afterwards Tirza (14:17). Samaria was subsequently chosen as the capital (16:24), and continued to be so till the destruction of the kingdom by the Assyrians ([2 Kings 17:5](/2kgs#2Kgs.17.5)). During the siege of Samaria (which lasted for three years) by the Assyrians, Shalmaneser died and was succeeded by Sargon, who himself thus records the capture of that city: “Samaria I looked at, I captured; 27,280 men who dwelt in it I carried away” ([2 Kings 17:6](/2kgs#2Kgs.17.6)) into Assyria. Thus after a duration of two hundred and fifty-three years the kingdom of the ten tribes came to an end. They were scattered throughout the East.

 “Judah held its ground against Assyria for yet one hundred and twenty-three years, and became the rallying-point of the dispersed of every tribe, and eventually gave its name to the whole race. Those of the people who in the last struggle escaped into the territories of Judah or other neighbouring countries naturally looked to Judah as the head and home of their race. And when Judah itself was carried off to Babylon, many of the exiled Israelites joined them from Assyria, and swelled that immense population which made Babylonia a second Palestine.”

 After the deportation of the ten tribes, the deserted land was colonized by various eastern tribes, whom the king of Assyria sent thither ([Ezra 4:2](/ezra#Ezra.4.2), [10](/ezra#Ezra.4.10); [2 Kings 17:24-29](/2kgs#2Kgs.17.24)).

After the battles at Gibeah, that tribe was almost extinguished, only six hundred men remaining.

These captives were given to them as wives, that the tribe might be saved from extinction ([Judg. 21](/judg#Judg.21)).

 This city was afterwards taken by Nahash, king of the Ammonites, but was delivered by Saul, the newly-elected king of Israel. In gratitude for this deliverance, forty years after this, the men of Jabesh-Gilead took down the bodies of Saul and of his three sons from the walls of Beth-shan, and after burning them, buried the bones under a tree near the city ([1 Sam. 31:11-13](/1sam#1Sam.31.11)).

He was born probably at Lahai-roi, when his father was fifty-nine and Abraham one hundred and fifty-nine years old. Like his father, he was of a quiet and gentle disposition, and when he grew up followed the life of a shepherd, while his brother Esau became an enterprising hunter. His dealing with Esau, however, showed much mean selfishness and cunning ([Gen. 25:29-34](/gen#Gen.25.29)).

 When Isaac was about 160 years of age, Jacob and his mother conspired to deceive the aged patriarch ([Gen. 27](/gen#Gen.27)), with the view of procuring the transfer of the birthright to himself. The birthright secured to him who possessed it (1) superior rank in his family ([Gen. 49:3](/gen#Gen.49.3)); (2) a double portion of the paternal inheritance ([Deut. 21:17](/deut#Deut.21.17)); (3) the priestly office in the family ([Num. 8:17-19](/num#Num.8.17)); and (4) the promise of the Seed in which all nations of the earth were to be blessed ([Gen. 22:18](/gen#Gen.22.18)).

 Soon after his acquisition of his father’s blessing ([Gen. 27](/gen#Gen.27)), Jacob became conscious of his guilt; and afraid of the anger of Esau, at the suggestion of Rebekah Isaac sent him away to Haran, 400 miles or more, to find a wife among his cousins, the family of Laban, the Syrian (28). There he met with Rachel (29). Laban would not consent to give him his daughter in marriage till he had served seven years; but to Jacob these years “seemed but a few days, for the love he had to her.” But when the seven years were expired, Laban craftily deceived Jacob, and gave him his daughter Leah. Other seven years of service had to be completed probably before he obtained the beloved Rachel. But “life-long sorrow, disgrace, and trials, in the retributive providence of God, followed as a consequence of this double union.”

 At the close of the fourteen years of service, Jacob desired to return to his parents, but at the entreaty of Laban he tarried yet six years with him, tending his flocks (31:41). He then set out with his family and property “to go to Isaac his father in the land of Canaan” ([Gen. 31](/gen#Gen.31)). Laban was angry when he heard that Jacob had set out on his journey, and pursued after him, overtaking him in seven days. The meeting was of a painful kind. After much recrimination and reproach directed against Jacob, Laban is at length pacified, and taking an affectionate farewell of his daughters, returns to his home in Padanaram. And now all connection of the Israelites with Mesopotamia is at an end.

 Soon after parting with Laban he is met by a company of angels, as if to greet him on his return and welcome him back to the Land of Promise (32:1, 2). He called the name of the place Mahanaim, i.e., “the double camp,” probably his own camp and that of the angels. The vision of angels was the counterpart of that he had formerly seen at Bethel, when, twenty years before, the weary, solitary traveller, on his way to Padan-aram, saw the angels of God ascending and descending on the ladder whose top reached to heaven (28:12).

 He now hears with dismay of the approach of his brother Esau with a band of 400 men to meet him. In great agony of mind he prepares for the worst. He feels that he must now depend only on God, and he betakes himself to him in earnest prayer, and sends on before him a munificent present to Esau, “a present to my lord Esau from thy servant Jacob.” Jacob’s family were then transported across the Jabbok; but he himself remained behind, spending the night in communion with God. While thus engaged, there appeared one in the form of a man who wrestled with him. In this mysterious contest Jacob prevailed, and as a memorial of it his name was changed to Israel (wrestler with God); and the place where this occured he called Peniel, “for”, said he, “I have seen God face to face, and my life is preserved” (32:25-31).

 After this anxious night, Jacob went on his way, halting, mysteriously weakened by the conflict, but strong in the assurance of the divine favour. Esau came forth and met him; but his spirit of revenge was appeased, and the brothers met as friends, and during the remainder of their lives they maintained friendly relations. After a brief sojourn at Succoth, Jacob moved forward and pitched his tent near Shechem (q.v.), 33:18; but at length, under divine directions, he moved to Bethel, where he made an altar unto God (35:6, 7), and where God appeared to him and renewed the Abrahamic covenant. While journeying from Bethel to Ephrath (the Canaanitish name of Bethlehem), Rachel died in giving birth to her second son Benjamin (35:16-20), fifteen or sixteen years after the birth of Joseph. He then reached the old family residence at Mamre, to wait on the dying bed of his father Isaac. The complete reconciliation between Esau and Jacob was shown by their uniting in the burial of the patriarch (35:27-29).

 Jacob was soon after this deeply grieved by the loss of his beloved son Joseph through the jealousy of his brothers (37:33). Then follows the story of the famine, and the successive goings down into Egypt to buy corn (42), which led to the discovery of the long-lost Joseph, and the patriarch’s going down with all his household, numbering about seventy souls ([Ex. 1:5](/exod#Exod.1.5); [Deut. 10:22](/deut#Deut.10.22); [Acts 7:14](/acts#Acts.7.14)), to sojourn in the land of Goshen. Here Jacob, “after being strangely tossed about on a very rough ocean, found at last a tranquil harbour, where all the best affections of his nature were gently exercised and largely unfolded” ([Gen. 48](/gen#Gen.48)). At length the end of his checkered course draws nigh, and he summons his sons to his bedside that he may bless them. Among his last words he repeats the story of Rachel’s death, although forty years had passed away since that event took place, as tenderly as if it had happened only yesterday; and when “he had made an end of charging his sons, he gathered up his feet into the bed, and yielded up the ghost” (49:33). His body was embalmed and carried with great pomp into the land of Canaan, and buried beside his wife Leah in the cave of Machpelah, according to his dying charge. There, probably, his embalmed body remains to this day (50:1-13).

 The history of Jacob is referred to by the prophets Hosea (12:3, 4, 12) and Malachi (1:2). In [Micah 1:5](/mic#Mic.1.5) the name is a poetic synonym for Israel, the kingdom of the ten tribes. There are, besides the mention of his name along with those of the other patriarchs, distinct references to events of his life in Paul’s epistles ([Rom. 9:11-13](/rom#Rom.9.11); [Heb. 12:16](/heb#Heb.12.16); [11:21](/heb#Heb.11.21)).

It was dug by Jacob, and hence its name, in the “parcel of ground” which he purchased from the sons of Hamor ([Gen. 33:19](/gen#Gen.33.19)). It still exists, but although after copious rains it contains a little water, it is now usually quite dry. It is at the entrance to the valley between Ebal and Gerizim, about 2 miles south-east of Shechem. It is about 9 feet in diameter and about 75 feet in depth, though in ancient times it was no doubt much deeper, probably twice as deep. The digging of such a well must have been a very laborious and costly undertaking.

 “Unfortunately, the well of Jacob has not escaped that misplaced religious veneration which cannot be satisfied with leaving the object of it as it is, but must build over it a shrine to protect and make it sacred. A series of buildings of various styles, and of different ages, have cumbered the ground, choked up the well, and disfigured the natural beauty and simplicity of the spot. At present the rubbish in the well has been cleared out; but there is still a domed structure over it, and you gaze down the shaft cut in the living rock and see at a depth of 70 feet the surface of the water glimmering with a pale blue light in the darkness, while you notice how the limestone blocks that form its curb have been worn smooth, or else furrowed by the ropes of centuries” (Hugh Macmillan).

 At the entrance of the enclosure round the well is planted in the ground one of the wooden poles that hold the telegraph wires between Jerusalem and Haifa.",0.0,unmatched,unmatched,,

The great lesson which he teaches them as Christians is patience, patience in trial (1:2), patience in good works (1:22-25), patience under provocation (3:17), patience under oppression (5:7), patience under persecution (5:10); and the ground of their patience is that the coming of the Lord draweth nigh, which is to right all wrong (5:8).”

He and his wife were two of the eight saved in the ark ([1 Pet. 3:20](/1pet#1Pet.3.20)). He was the progenitor of many tribes inhabiting the east of Europe and the north of Asia ([Gen. 10:2-5](/gen#Gen.10.2)). An act of filial piety (9:20-27) was the occasion of Noah’s prophecy of the extension of his posterity.

 After the Flood the earth was re-peopled by the descendants of Noah, “the sons of Japheth” ([Gen. 10:2](/gen#Gen.10.2)), “the sons of Ham” (6), and “the sons of Shem” (22). It is important to notice that modern ethnological science, reasoning from a careful analysis of facts, has arrived at the conclusion that there is a three-fold division of the human family, corresponding in a remarkable way with the great ethnological chapter of the book of Genesis (10). The three great races thus distinguished are called the Semitic, Aryan, and Turanian (Allophylian). “Setting aside the cases where the ethnic names employed are of doubtful application, it cannot reasonably be questioned that the author [of [Gen. 10](/gen#Gen.10)] has in his account of the sons of Japheth classed together the Cymry or Celts (Gomer), the Medes (Madai), and the Ionians or Greeks (Javan), thereby anticipating what has become known in modern times as the ‘Indo-European Theory,’ or the essential unity of the Aryan (Asiatic) race with the principal races of Europe, indicated by the Celts and the Ionians. Nor can it be doubted that he has thrown together under the one head of ’children of Shem’ the Assyrians (Asshur), the Syrians (Aram), the Hebrews (Eber), and the Joktanian Arabs (Joktan), four of the principal races which modern ethnology recognizes under the heading of ‘Semitic.’ Again, under the heading of ‘sons of Ham,’ the author has arranged ‘Cush’, i.e., the Ethiopians; ‘Mizraim,’ the people of Egypt; ‘Sheba and Dedan,’ or certain of the Southern Arabs; and ‘Nimrod,’ or the ancient people of Babylon, four races between which the latest linguistic researches have established a close affinity” (Rawlinson’s Hist.

 On the death of his father his younger brother Jehoahaz (=Shallum, [Jer. 22:11](/jer#Jer.22.11)), who favoured the Chaldeans against the Egyptians, was made king by the people; but the king of Egypt, Pharaoh-necho, invaded the land and deposed Jehoahaz ([2 Kings 23:33](/2kgs#2Kgs.23.33), [34](/2kgs#2Kgs.23.34); [Jer. 22:10-12](/jer#Jer.22.10)), setting Eliakim on the throne in his stead, and changing his name to Jehoiakim.

 After this the king of Egypt took no part in Jewish politics, having been defeated by the Chaldeans at Carchemish ([2 Kings 24:7](/2kgs#2Kgs.24.7); [Jer. 46:2](/jer#Jer.46.2)). Palestine was now invaded and conquered by Nebuchadnezzar. Jehoiakim was taken prisoner and carried captive to Babylon ([2 Chr. 36:6](/2chr#2Chr.36.6), [7](/2chr#2Chr.36.7)). It was at this time that Daniel also and his three companions were taken captive to Babylon ([Dan. 1:1](/dan#Dan.1.1), [2](/dan#Dan.1.2)).

 Nebuchadnezzar reinstated Jehoiakim on his throne, but treated him as a vassal king. In the year after this, Jeremiah caused his prophecies to be read by Baruch in the court of the temple. Jehoiakim, hearing of this, had them also read in the royal palace before himself. The words displeased him, and taking the roll from the hands of Baruch he cut it in pieces and threw it into the fire ([Jer. 36:23](/jer#Jer.36.23)). During his disastrous reign there was a return to the old idolatry and corruption of the days of Manasseh.

 After three years of subjection to Babylon, Jehoiakim withheld his tribute and threw off the yoke ([2 Kings 24:1](/2kgs#2Kgs.24.1)), hoping to make himself independent. Nebuchadnezzar sent bands of Chaldeans, Syrians, and Ammonites ([2 Kings 24:2](/2kgs#2Kgs.24.2)) to chastise his rebellious vassal. They cruelly harassed the whole country (comp. [Jer. 49:1-6](/jer#Jer.49.1)). The king came to a violent death, and his body having been thrown over the wall of Jerusalem, to convince the beseieging army that he was dead, after having been dragged away, was buried beyond the gates of Jerusalem “with the burial of an ass,” B.C. 599 ([Jer. 22:18](/jer#Jer.22.18), [19](/jer#Jer.22.19); 36:30).

He reigned twelve years, B.C. 896-884 ([2 Kings 1:17](/2kgs#2Kgs.1.17); [3:1](/2kgs#2Kgs.3.1)). His first work was to reduce to subjection the Moabites, who had asserted their independence in the reign of his brother. Jehoshaphat, king of Judah, assisted Jehoram in this effort. He was further helped by his ally the king of Edom. Elisha went forth with the confederated army ([2 Kings 3:1-19](/2kgs#2Kgs.3.1)), and at the solicitation of Jehoshaphat encouraged the army with the assurance from the Lord of a speedy victory. The Moabites under Mesha their king were utterly routed and their cities destroyed. At Kir-haraseth Mesha made a final stand. The Israelites refrained from pressing their victory further, and returned to their own land.

 Elisha afterwards again befriended Jehoram when a war broke out between the Syrians and Israel, and in a remarkable way brought that war to a bloodless close ([2 Kings 6:23](/2kgs#2Kgs.6.23)). But Jehoram, becoming confident in his own power, sank into idolatry, and brought upon himself and his land another Syrian invasion, which led to great suffering and distress in Samaria ([2 Kings 6:24-33](/2kgs#2Kgs.6.24)). By a remarkable providential interposition the city was saved from utter destruction, and the Syrians were put to flight ([2 Kings 7:6-15](/2kgs#2Kgs.7.6)).

 Jehoram was wounded in a battle with the Syrians at Ramah, and obliged to return to Jezreel ([2 Kings 8:29](/2kgs#2Kgs.8.29); [9:14](/2kgs#2Kgs.9.14), [15](/2kgs#2Kgs.9.15)), and soon after the army proclaimed their leader Jehu king of Israel, and revolted from their allegiance to Jehoram ([2 Kings 9](/2kgs#2Kgs.9)).

His wife was Athaliah, the daughter of Ahab and Jezebel. His daughter Jehosheba was married to the high priest Jehoiada.

Jehoshaphat 5,3330,j-p179.6,Jehoshaphat,"The son and successor of Asa, king of Judah. After fortifying his kingdom against Israel ([2 Chr. 17:1](/2chr#2Chr.17.1), [2](/2chr#2Chr.17.2)), he set himself to cleanse the land of idolatry ([1 Kings 22:43](/1kgs#1Kgs.22.43)). In the third year of his reign he sent out priests and Levites over the land to instruct the people in the law ([2 Chr. 17:7-9](/2chr#2Chr.17.7)). He enjoyed a great measure of peace and prosperity, the blessing of God resting on the people “in their basket and their store.”

 The great mistake of his reign was his entering into an alliance with Ahab, the king of Israel, which involved him in much disgrace, and brought disaster on his kingdom ([1 Kings 22:1-33](/1kgs#1Kgs.22.1)). Escaping from the bloody battle of Ramoth-gilead, the prophet Jehu ([2 Chr. 19:1-3](/2chr#2Chr.19.1)) reproached him for the course he had been pursuing, whereupon he entered with rigour on his former course of opposition to all idolatry, and of deepening interest in the worship of God and in the righteous government of the people ([2 Chr. 19:4-11](/2chr#2Chr.19.4)).

 Again he entered into an alliance with Ahaziah, the king of Israel, for the purpose of carrying on maritime commerce with Ophir. But the fleet that was then equipped at Ezion-gaber was speedily wrecked. A new fleet was fitted out without the co-operation of the king of Israel, and although it was successful, the trade was not prosecuted ([2 Chr. 20:35-37](/2chr#2Chr.20.35); [1 Kings 22:48-49](/1kgs#1Kgs.22.48)).

 He subsequently joined Jehoram, king of Israel, in a war against the Moabites, who were under tribute to Israel. This war was successful. The Moabites were subdued; but the dreadful act of Mesha in offering his own son a sacrifice on the walls of Kir-haresheth in the sight of the armies of Israel filled him with horror, and he withdrew and returned to his own land ([2 Kings 3:4-27](/2kgs#2Kgs.3.4)).

 The last most notable event of his reign was that recorded in [2 Chr. 20](/2chr#2Chr.20). The Moabites formed a great and powerful confederacy with the surrounding nations, and came against Jehoshaphat. The allied forces were encamped at Engedi. The king and his people were filled with alarm, and betook themselves to God in prayer. The king prayed in the court of the temple, “O our God, wilt thou not judge them? for we have no might against this great company that cometh against us.” Amid the silence that followed, the voice of Jahaziel the Levite was heard announcing that on the morrow all this great host would be overthrown. So it was, for they quarrelled among themselves, and slew one another, leaving to the people of Judah only to gather the rich spoils of the slain. This was recognized as a great deliverance wrought for them by God (B.C. 890). Soon after this Jehoshaphat died, after a reign of twenty-five years, being sixty years of age, and was succeeded by his son Jehoram ([1 Kings 22:50](/1kgs#1Kgs.22.50)). He had this testimony, that “he sought the Lord with all his heart” ([2 Chr. 22:9](/2chr#2Chr.22.9)).

This has been fulfilled; but Joel speaks of the final conflict, when God would destroy all Jerusalem’s enemies, of whom Tyre and Zidon, etc., were types. The “valley of Jehoshaphat” may therefore be simply regarded as a general term for the theatre of God’s final judgments on the enemies of Israel.

This name, the Tetragrammaton of the Greeks, was held by the later Jews to be so sacred that it was never pronounced except by the high priest on the great Day of Atonement, when he entered into the most holy place. Whenever this name occurred in the sacred books they pronounced it, as they still do, “Adonai” (i.e., Lord), thus using another word in its stead. The Massorets gave to it the vowel-points appropriate to this word. This Jewish practice was founded on a false interpretation of [Lev. 24:16](/lev#Lev.24.16). The meaning of the word appears from [Ex. 3:14](/exod#Exod.3.14) to be “the unchanging, eternal, self-existent God,” the “I am that I am,” a convenant-keeping God. (Comp.

 The Hebrew name “Jehovah” is generally translated in the Authorized Version (and the Revised Version has not departed from this rule) by the word LORD printed in small capitals, to distinguish it from the rendering of the Hebrew Adonai and the Greek Kurios, which are also rendered Lord, but printed in the usual type. The Hebrew word is translated “Jehovah” only in [Ex. 6:3](/exod#Exod.6.3); [Ps. 83:18](/ps#Ps.83.18); [Isa. 12:2](/isa#Isa.12.2); [26:4](/isa#Isa.26.4), and in the compound names mentioned below.

 It is worthy of notice that this name is never used in the LXX., the Samaritan Pentateuch, the Apocrypha, or in the New Testament.

During the progress of a war against the Syrians, who were becoming more and more troublesome to Israel, in a battle at Ramoth-gilead Jehoram, the king of Israel, had been wounded; and leaving his army there, had returned to Jezreel, whither his ally, Ahaziah, king of Judah, had also gone on a visit of sympathy with him ([2 Kings 8:28](/2kgs#2Kgs.8.28), [29](/2kgs#2Kgs.8.29)). The commanders, being left in charge of the conduct of the war, met in council; and while engaged in their deliberations, a messenger from Elisha appeared in the camp, and taking Jehu from the council, led him into a secret chamber, and there anointed him king over Israel, and immediately retired and disappeared ([2 Kings 9:5](/2kgs#2Kgs.9.5), [6](/2kgs#2Kgs.9.6)). On being interrogated by his companions as to the object of this mysterious visitor, he informed them of what had been done, when immediately, with the utmost enthusiasm, they blew their trumpets and proclaimed him king ([2 Kings 9:11-14](/2kgs#2Kgs.9.11)). He then with a chosen band set forth with all speed to Jezreel, where, with his own hand, he slew Jehoram, shooting him through the heart with an arrow (9:24). The king of Judah, when trying to escape, was fatally wounded by one of Jehu’s soldiers at Beth-gan. On entering the city, Jehu commanded the eunchs of the royal palace to cast down Jezebel into the street, where her mangled body was trodden under foot by the horses. Jehu was now master of Jezreel, whence he communicated with the persons in authority in Samaria the capital, commanding them to appear before him on the morrow with the heads of all the royal princes of Samaria. Accordingly on the morrow seventy heads were piled up in two heaps at his gate. At “the shearing-house” ([2 Kings 10:12-14](/2kgs#2Kgs.10.12)) other forty-two connected with the house of Ahab were put to death ([2 Kings 10:14](/2kgs#2Kgs.10.14)). As Jehu rode on toward Samaria, he met Jehonadab (q.v.), whom he took into his chariot, and they entered the capital together. By a cunning stratagem he cut off all the worshippers of Baal found in Samaria ([2 Kings 10:19-25](/2kgs#2Kgs.10.19)), and destroyed the temple of the idol ([2 Kings 10:27](/2kgs#2Kgs.10.27)).

 Notwithstanding all this apparent zeal for the worship of Jehovah, Jehu yet tolerated the worship of the golden calves at Dan and Bethel. For this the divine displeasure rested upon him, and his kingdom suffered disaster in war with the Syrians ([2 Kings 10:29-33](/2kgs#2Kgs.10.29)). He died after a reign of twenty-eight years (B.C. 884-856), and was buried in Samaria (10:34-36). “He was one of those decisive, terrible, and ambitious, yet prudent, calculating, and passionless men whom God from time to time raises up to change the fate of empires and execute his judgments on the earth.” He was the first Jewish king who came in contact with the Assyrian power in the time of Shalmaneser II.",4.0,person,jehu_817,jehu_817,

He has been described as “a wild, daring, Gilead mountaineer, a sort of warrior Elijah.” After forty-five years of comparative quiet Israel again apostatized, and in “process of time the children of Ammon made war against Israel” (11:5). In their distress the elders of Gilead went to fetch Jephthah out of the land of Tob, to which he had fled when driven out wrongfully by his brothers from his father’s inheritance (2), and the people made him their head and captain. The “elders of Gilead” in their extremity summoned him to their aid, and he at once undertook the conduct of the war against Ammon. Twice he sent an embassy to the king of Ammon, but in vain. War was inevitable. The people obeyed his summons, and “the spirit of the Lord came upon him.” Before engaging in war he vowed that if successful he would offer as a “burnt-offering” whatever would come out of the door of his house first to meet him on his return. The defeat of the Ammonites was complete. “He smote them from Aroer, even till thou come to Minnith, even twenty cities, and unto the plain of the vineyards [Heb. ‘Abel Keramim], with a very great slaughter” ([Judg. 11:33](/judg#Judg.11.33)). The men of Ephraim regarded themselves as insulted in not having been called by Jephthah to go with him to war against Ammon. This led to a war between the men of Gilead and Ephraim (12:4), in which many of the Ephraimites perished. “Then died Jephthah the Gileadite, and was buried in one of the cities of Gilead” (7).",0.0,person,jephthah_839,jephthah_839,

After a crushing defeat of the Ammonites, Jephthah returned to his own house, and the first to welcome him was his own daughter. This was a terrible blow to the victor, and in his despair he cried out, “Alas, my daughter! thou hast brought me very low...I have opened my mouth unto the Lord, and cannot go back.” With singular nobleness of spirit she answered, “Do to me according to that which hath proceeded out of thy mouth.” She only asked two months to bewail her maidenhood with her companions upon the mountains. She utters no reproach against her father’s rashness, and is content to yield her life since her father has returned a conqueror. But was it so? Did Jephthah offer up his daughter as a “burnt-offering”? This question has been much debated, and there are many able commentators who argue that such a sacrifice was actually offered. We are constrained, however, by a consideration of Jephthah’s known piety as a true worshipper of Jehovah, his evident acquaintance with the law of Moses, to which such sacrifices were abhorrent ([Lev. 18:21](/lev#Lev.18.21); [20:2-5](/lev#Lev.20.2); [Deut. 12:31](/deut#Deut.12.31)), and the place he holds in the roll of the heroes of the faith in the Epistle to the Hebrews (11:32), to conclude that she was only doomed to a life of perpetual celibacy.",0.0,unmatched,unmatched,,

He was called to the prophetical office when still young (1:6), in the thirteenth year of Josiah (B.C. 628). He left his native place, and went to reside in Jerusalem, where he greatly assisted Josiah in his work of reformation ([2 Kings 23:1-25](/2kgs#2Kgs.23.1)). The death of this pious king was bewailed by the prophet as a national calamity ([2 Chr. 35:25](/2chr#2Chr.35.25)).

 During the three years of the reign of Jehoahaz we find no reference to Jeremiah, but in the beginning of the reign of Jehoiakim the enmity of the people against him broke out in bitter persecution, and he was placed apparently under restraint ([Jer. 36:5](/jer#Jer.36.5)). In the fourth year of Jehoiakim he was commanded to write the predictions given to him, and to read them to the people on the fast-day. This was done by Baruch his servant in his stead, and produced much public excitement. The roll was read to the king. In his recklessness he seized the roll, and cut it to pieces, and cast it into the fire, and ordered both Baruch and Jeremiah to be apprehended. Jeremiah procured another roll, and wrote in it the words of the roll the king had destroyed, and “many like words” besides ([Jer. 36:32](/jer#Jer.36.32)).

 He remained in Jerusalem, uttering from time to time his words of warning, but without effect. He was there when Nebuchadnezzar besieged the city ([Jer. 37:4](/jer#Jer.37.4), [5](/jer#Jer.37.5)), B.C. 589. The rumour of the approach of the Egyptians to aid the Jews in this crisis induced the Chaldeans to withdraw and return to their own land. This, however, was only for a time. The prophet, in answer to his prayer, received a message from God announcing that the Chaldeans would come again and take the city, and burn it with fire (37:7, 8). The princes, in their anger at such a message by Jeremiah, cast him into prison (37:15-38:13). He was still in confinement when the city was taken (B.C. 588). The Chaldeans released him, and showed him great kindness, allowing him to choose the place of his residence. He accordingly went to Mizpah with Gedaliah, who had been made governor of Judea. Johanan succeeded Gedaliah, and refusing to listen to Jeremiah’s counsels, went down into Egypt, taking Jeremiah and Baruch with him ([Jer. 43:6](/jer#Jer.43.6)). There probably the prophet spent the remainder of his life, in vain seeking still to turn the people to the Lord, from whom they had so long revolted (44). He lived till the reign of Evil-Merodach, son of Nebuchadnezzar, and must have been about ninety years of age at his death. We have no authentic record of his death. He may have died at Tahpanhes, or, according to a tradition, may have gone to Babylon with the army of Nebuchadnezzar; but of this there is nothing certain.",6.0,person,jeremiah_853,jeremiah_853,

 In Egypt, after an interval, Jeremiah is supposed to have added three sections, viz., ch. 37-39; 40-43; and 44.

 The principal Messianic prophecies are found in 23:1-8; 31:31-40; and 33:14-26.

 Jeremiah’s prophecies are noted for the frequent repetitions found in them of the same words and phrases and imagery. They cover the period of about 30 years. They are not recorded in the order of time. When and under what circumstances this book assumed its present form we know not.

 The LXX. Version of this book is, in its arrangement and in other particulars, singularly at variance with the original. The LXX. omits 10:6-8; 27:19-22; 29:16-20; 33:14-26; 39:4-13; 52:2, 3, 15, 28-30, etc. About 2,700 words in all of the original are omitted. These omissions, etc., are capricious and arbitrary, and render the version unreliable.",19.0,unmatched,unmatched,,
Jericho,3398,j-p239.1,Jericho,"Place of fragrance, a fenced city in the midst of a vast grove of palm trees, in the plain of Jordan, over against the place where that river was crossed by the Israelites ([Josh. 3:16](/josh#Josh.3.16)). Its site was near the ‘Ain es-Sultan, Elisha’s Fountain ([2 Kings 2:19-22](/2kgs#2Kgs.2.19)), about 5 miles west of Jordan. It was the most important city in the Jordan valley ([Num. 22:1](/num#Num.22.1); [34:15](/num#Num.34.15)), and the strongest fortress in all the land of Canaan. It was the key to Western Palestine.

 This city was taken in a very remarkable manner by the Israelites ([Josh. 6](/josh#Josh.6)). God gave it into their hands. The city was “accursed” (Heb. herem, “devoted” to Jehovah), and accordingly ([Josh. 6:17](/josh#Josh.6.17); comp. [Lev. 27:28](/lev#Lev.27.28), [29](/lev#Lev.27.29); [Deut. 13:16](/deut#Deut.13.16)) all the inhabitants and all the spoil of the city were to be destroyed, “only the silver, and the gold, and the vessels of brass and of iron” were reserved and “put into the treasury of the house of Jehovah” ([Josh. 6:24](/josh#Josh.6.24); comp. [Num. 31:22](/num#Num.31.22), [23](/num#Num.31.23), [50](/num#Num.31.50)-54). Only Rahab “and her father’s household, and all that she had,” were preserved from destruction, according to the promise of the spies ([Josh. 2:14](/josh#Josh.2.14)). In one of the Amarna tablets Adoni-zedec (q.v.) writes to the king of Egypt informing him that the ‘Abiri (Hebrews) had prevailed, and had taken the fortress of Jericho, and were plundering “all the king’s lands.” It would seem that the Egyptian troops had before this been withdrawn from Palestine.

 This city was given to the tribe of Benjamin ([Josh. 18:21](/josh#Josh.18.21)), and it was inhabited in the time of the Judges ([Judg. 3:13](/judg#Judg.3.13); [2 Sam. 10:5](/2sam#2Sam.10.5)). It is not again mentioned till the time of David ([2 Sam. 10:5](/2sam#2Sam.10.5)). “Children of Jericho” were among the captives who returned under Zerubbabel [Ezra 2:34](/ezra#Ezra.2.34); [Neh. 7:36](/neh#Neh.7.36)). Hiel (q.v.) the Bethelite attempted to make it once more a fortified city ([1 Kings 16:34](/1kgs#1Kgs.16.34)). Between the beginning and the end of his undertaking all his children were cut off.

 In New Testament times Jericho stood some distance to the south-east of the ancient one, and near the opening of the valley of Achor. It was a rich and flourishing town, having a considerable trade, and celebrated for the palm trees which adorned the plain around. It was visited by our Lord on his last journey to Jerusalem. Here he gave sight to two blind men ([Matt. 20:29-34](/matt#Matt.20.29); [Mark 10:46-52](/mark#Mark.10.46)), and brought salvation to the house of Zacchaeus the publican ([Luke 19:2-10](/luke#Luke.19.2)).

 The poor hamlet of er-Riha, the representative of modern Jericho, is situated some two miles farther to the east. It is in a ruinous condition, having been destroyed by the Turks in 1840. “The soil of the plain,” about the middle of which the ancient city stood, “is unsurpassed in fertility; there is abundance of water for irrigation, and many of the old aqueducts are almost perfect; yet nearly the whole plain is waste and desolate...The climate of Jericho is exceedingly hot and unhealthy. This is accounted for by the depression of the plain, which is about 1,200 feet below the level of the sea.”

 There were three different Jerichos, on three different sites, the Jericho of Joshua, the Jericho of Herod, and the Jericho of the Crusades. Er-Riha, the modern Jericho, dates from the time of the Crusades. Dr. Bliss has found in a hollow scooped out for some purpose or other near the foot of the biggest mound above the Sultan’s Spring specimens of Amorite or pre-Israelitish pottery precisely identical with what he had discovered on the site of ancient Lachish. He also traced in this place for a short distance a mud brick wall in situ, which he supposes to be the very wall that fell before the trumpets of Joshua. The wall is not far from the foot of the great precipice of Quarantania and its numerous caverns, and the spies of Joshua could easily have fled from the city and been speedily hidden in these fastnesses.",0.0,place,jericho_634,,jericho_634

He was the son of a widow of Zereda, and while still young was promoted by Solomon to be chief superintendent of the “burnden”, i.e., of the bands of forced labourers. Influenced by the words of the prophet Ahijah, he began to form conspiracies with the view of becoming king of the ten tribes; but these having been discovered, he fled to Egypt ([1 Kings 11:29-40](/1kgs#1Kgs.11.29)), where he remained for a length of time under the protection of Shishak I. On the death of Solomon, the ten tribes, having revolted, sent to invite him to become their king. The conduct of Rehoboam favoured the designs of Jeroboam, and he was accordingly proclaimed “king of Israel” ([1 Kings 12](/1kgs#1Kgs.12): 1-20). He rebuilt and fortified Shechem as the capital of his kingdom. He at once adopted means to perpetuate the division thus made between the two parts of the kingdom, and erected at Dan and Bethel, the two extremities of his kingdom, “golden calves,” which he set up as symbols of Jehovah, enjoining the people not any more to go up to worship at Jerusalem, but to bring their offerings to the shrines he had erected. Thus he became distinguished as the man “who made Israel to sin.” This policy was followed by all the succeeding kings of Israel.

 While he was engaged in offering incense at Bethel, a prophet from Judah appeared before him with a warning message from the Lord. Attempting to arrest the prophet for his bold words of defiance, his hand was “dried up,” and the altar before which he stood was rent asunder. At his urgent entreaty his “hand was restored him again” ([1 Kings 13:1-6](/1kgs#1Kgs.13.1), [9](/1kgs#1Kgs.13.9); comp. [2 Kings 23:15](/2kgs#2Kgs.23.15)); but the miracle made no abiding impression on him. His reign was one of constant war with the house of Judah.

He followed the example of the first Jeroboam in keeping up the worship of the golden calves ([2 Kings 14:24](/2kgs#2Kgs.14.24)). His reign was contemporary with those of Amaziah ([2 Kings 14:23](/2kgs#2Kgs.14.23)) and Uzziah (15:1), kings of Judah. He was victorious over the Syrians (13:4; 14:26, 27), and extended Israel to its former limits, from “the entering of Hamath to the sea of the plain” (14:25; [Amos 6:14](/amos#Amos.6.14)). His reign of forty-one years was the most prosperous that Israel had ever known as yet.

Jerusalem,3420,j-p265.3,Jerusalem,"Called also Salem, Ariel, Jebus, the “city of God,” the “holy city;” by the modern Arabs el-Khuds, meaning “the holy;” once “the city of Judah” ([2 Chr. 25:28](/2chr#2Chr.25.28)). This name is in the original in the dual form, and means “possession of peace,” or “foundation of peace.” The dual form probably refers to the two mountains on which it was built, viz., Zion and Moriah; or, as some suppose, to the two parts of the city, the “upper” and the “lower city.” Jerusalem is a “mountain city enthroned on a mountain fastness” (comp. [Ps. 68:15](/ps#Ps.68.15), [16](/ps#Ps.68.16); 87:1; 125:2; 76:1, 2; 122:3). It stands on the edge of one of the highest table-lands in Palestine, and is surrounded on the south-eastern, the southern, and the western sides by deep and precipitous ravines.

 It is first mentioned in Scripture under the name Salem ([Gen. 14:18](/gen#Gen.14.18); comp. [Ps. 76:2](/ps#Ps.76.2)). When first mentioned under the name Jerusalem, Adonizedek was its king ([Josh. 10:1](/josh#Josh.10.1)). It is afterwards named among the cities of Benjamin ([Judg. 19:10](/judg#Judg.19.10); [1 Chr. 11:4](/1chr#1Chr.11.4)); but in the time of David it was divided between Benjamin and Judah. After the death of Joshua the city was taken and set on fire by the men of Judah ([Judg. 1:1-8](/judg#Judg.1.1)); but the Jebusites were not wholly driven out of it. The city is not again mentioned till we are told that David brought the head of Goliath thither ([1 Sam. 17:54](/1sam#1Sam.17.54)). David afterwards led his forces against the Jebusites still residing within its walls, and drove them out, fixing his own dwelling on Zion, which he called “the city of David” ([2 Sam. 5:5-9](/2sam#2Sam.5.5); [1 Chr. 11:4-8](/1chr#1Chr.11.4)). Here he built an altar to the Lord on the threshing-floor of Araunah the Jebusite ([2 Sam. 24:15-25](/2sam#2Sam.24.15)), and thither he brought up the ark of the covenant and placed it in the new tabernacle which he had prepared for it. Jerusalem now became the capital of the kingdom.

 After the death of David, Solomon built the temple, a house for the name of the Lord, on Mount Moriah (B.C. 1010). He also greatly strengthened and adorned the city, and it became the great centre of all the civil and religious affairs of the nation ([Deut. 12:5](/deut#Deut.12.5); comp. 12:14; 14:23; 16:11-16; [Ps. 122](/ps#Ps.122)).

 After the disruption of the kingdom on the accession to the throne of Rehoboam, the son of Solomon, Jerusalem became the capital of the kingdom of the two tribes. It was subsequently often taken and retaken by the Egyptians, the Assyrians, and by the kings of Israel ([2 Kings 14:13](/2kgs#2Kgs.14.13), [14](/2kgs#2Kgs.14.14); 18:15, 16; 23:33-35; 24:14; [2 Chr. 12:9](/2chr#2Chr.12.9); [26:9](/2chr#2Chr.26.9); [27:3](/2chr#2Chr.27.3), [4](/2chr#2Chr.27.4); [29:3](/2chr#2Chr.29.3); [32:30](/2chr#2Chr.32.30); [33:11](/2chr#2Chr.33.11)), till finally, for the abounding iniquities of the nation, after a siege of three years, it was taken and utterly destroyed, its walls razed to the ground, and its temple and palaces consumed by fire, by Nebuchadnezzar, the king of Babylon ([2 Kings 25](/2kgs#2Kgs.25); [2 Chr. 36](/2chr#2Chr.36); [Jer. 39](/jer#Jer.39)), B.C. 588. The desolation of the city and the land was completed by the retreat of the principal Jews into Egypt ([Jer. 40](/jer#Jer.40)-44), and by the final carrying captive into Babylon of all that still remained in the land (52:3), so that it was left without an inhabitant (B.C. 582). Compare the predictions, [Deut. 28](/deut#Deut.28); [Lev. 26:14-39](/lev#Lev.26.14).

 But the streets and walls of Jerusalem were again to be built, in troublous times ([Dan. 9:16](/dan#Dan.9.16), [19](/dan#Dan.9.19), [25](/dan#Dan.9.25)), after a captivity of seventy years. This restoration was begun B.C. 536, “in the first year of Cyrus” ([Ezra 1:2](/ezra#Ezra.1.2), [3](/ezra#Ezra.1.3), [5](/ezra#Ezra.1.5)-11). The Books of Ezra and Nehemiah contain the history of the re-building of the city and temple, and the restoration of the kingdom of the Jews, consisting of a portion of all the tribes. The kingdom thus constituted was for two centuries under the dominion of Persia, till B.C. 331; and thereafter, for about a century and a half, under the rulers of the Greek empire in Asia, till B.C. 167. For a century the Jews maintained their independence under native rulers, the Asmonean princes. At the close of this period they fell under the rule of Herod and of members of his family, but practically under Rome, till the time of the destruction of Jerusalem, A.D. 70. The city was then laid in ruins.

 The modern Jerusalem by-and-by began to be built over the immense beds of rubbish resulting from the overthrow of the ancient city; and whilst it occupies certainly the same site, there are no evidences that even the lines of its streets are now what they were in the ancient city. Till A.D. 131 the Jews who still lingered about Jerusalem quietly submitted to the Roman sway. But in that year the emperor (Hadrian), in order to hold them in subjection, rebuilt and fortified the city. The Jews, however, took possession of it, having risen under the leadership of one Bar-Chohaba (i.e., “the son of the star”) in revolt against the Romans. Some four years afterwards (A.D. 135), however, they were driven out of it with great slaughter, and the city was again destroyed; and over its ruins was built a Roman city called Aelia Capitolina, a name which it retained till it fell under the dominion of the Mohammedans, when it was called el-Khuds, i.e., “the holy.”

 In A.D. 326 Helena, mother of the emperor Constantine, made a pilgrimage to Jerusalem with the view of discovering the places mentioned in the life of our Lord. She caused a church to be built on what was then supposed to be the place of the nativity at Bethlehem. Constantine, animated by her example, searched for the holy sepulchre, and built over the supposed site a magnificent church, which was completed and dedicated A.D. 335. He relaxed the laws against the Jews till this time in force, and permitted them once a year to visit the city and wail over the desolation of “the holy and beautiful house.”

 In A.D. 614 the Persians, after defeating the Roman forces of the emperor Heraclius, took Jerusalem by storm, and retained it till A.D. 637, when it was taken by the Arabians under the Khalif Omar. It remained in their possession till it passed, in A.D. 960, under the dominion of the Fatimite khalifs of Egypt, and in A.D. 1073 under the Turcomans. In A.D. 1099 the crusader Godfrey of Bouillon took the city from the Moslems with great slaughter, and was elected king of Jerusalem. He converted the Mosque of Omar into a Christian cathedral. During the eighty-eight years which followed, many churches and convents were erected in the holy city. The Church of the Holy Sepulchre was rebuilt during this period, and it alone remains to this day. In A.D. 1187 the sultan Saladin wrested the city from the Christians. From that time to the present day, with few intervals, Jerusalem has remained in the hands of the Moslems. It has, however, during that period been again and again taken and retaken, demolished in great part and rebuilt, no city in the world having passed through so many vicissitudes.

 In the year 1850 the Greek and Latin monks residing in Jerusalem had a fierce dispute about the guardianship of what are called the “holy places.” In this dispute the emperor Nicholas of Russia sided with the Greeks, and Louis Napoleon, the emperor of the French, with the Latins. This led the Turkish authorities to settle the question in a way unsatisfactory to Russia. Out of this there sprang the Crimean War, which was protracted and sanguinary, but which had important consequences in the way of breaking down the barriers of Turkish exclusiveness.

 Modern Jerusalem “lies near the summit of a broad mountain-ridge, which extends without interruption from the plain of Esdraelon to a line drawn between the southern end of the Dead Sea and the southeastern corner of the Mediterranean.” This high, uneven table-land is everywhere from 20 to 25 geographical miles in breadth. It was anciently known as the mountains of Ephraim and Judah.

 “Jerusalem is a city of contrasts, and differs widely from Damascus, not merely because it is a stone town in mountains, whilst the latter is a mud city in a plain, but because while in Damascus Moslem religion and Oriental custom are unmixed with any foreign element, in Jerusalem every form of religion, every nationality of East and West, is represented at one time.”

 Jerusalem is first mentioned under that name in the Book of Joshua, and the Tell-el-Amarna collection of tablets includes six letters from its Amorite king to Egypt, recording the attack of the Abiri about B.C. 1480. The name is there spelt Uru-Salim (“city of peace”). Another monumental record in which the Holy City is named is that of Sennacherib’s attack in B.C. 702. The “camp of the Assyrians” was still shown about A.D. 70, on the flat ground to the north-west, included in the new quarter of the city.

 The city of David included both the upper city and Millo, and was surrounded by a wall built by David and Solomon, who appear to have restored the original Jebusite fortifications. The name Zion (or Sion) appears to have been, like Ariel (“the hearth of God”), a poetical term for Jerusalem, but in the Greek age was more specially used of the Temple hill. The priests’ quarter grew up on Ophel, south of the Temple, where also was Solomon’s Palace outside the original city of David. The walls of the city were extended by Jotham and Manasseh to include this suburb and the Temple ([2 Chr. 27:3](/2chr#2Chr.27.3); [33:14](/2chr#2Chr.33.14)).

 Jerusalem is now a town of some 50,000 inhabitants, with ancient mediaeval walls, partly on the old lines, but extending less far to the south. The traditional sites, as a rule, were first shown in the 4th and later centuries A.D., and have no authority. The results of excavation have, however, settled most of the disputed questions, the limits of the Temple area, and the course of the old walls having been traced.",0.0,unmatched,unmatched,,"jerusalem_636,jerusalems_637"

 This is the Greek form of the Hebrew name Joshua, which was originally Hoshea ([Num. 13:8](/num#Num.13.8), [16](/num#Num.13.16)), but changed by Moses into Jehoshua ([Num. 13:16](/num#Num.13.16); [1 Chr. 7:27](/1chr#1Chr.7.27)), or Joshua. After the Exile it assumed the form Jeshua, whence the Greek form Jesus. It was given to our Lord to denote the object of his mission, to save ([Matt. 1:21](/matt#Matt.1.21)).

 The life of Jesus on earth may be divided into two great periods, (1) that of his private life, till he was about thirty years of age; and (2) that of his public life, which lasted about three years.

 In the “fulness of time” he was born at Bethlehem, in the reign of the emperor Augustus, of Mary, who was betrothed to Joseph, a carpenter ([Matt. 1:1](/matt#Matt.1.1); [Luke 3:23](/luke#Luke.3.23); comp. [John 7:42](/john#John.7.42)). His birth was announced to the shepherds ([Luke 2:8-20](/luke#Luke.2.8)). Wise men from the east came to Bethlehem to see him who was born “King of the Jews,” bringing gifts with them ([Matt. 2:1-12](/matt#Matt.2.1)). Herod’s cruel jealousy led to Joseph’s flight into Egypt with Mary and the infant Jesus, where they tarried till the death of this king ([Matt. 2:13-23](/matt#Matt.2.13)), when they returned and settled in Nazareth, in Lower Galilee (2:23; comp. [Luke 4:16](/luke#Luke.4.16); [John 1:46](/john#John.1.46), etc.). At the age of twelve years he went up to Jerusalem to the Passover with his parents. There, in the temple, “in the midst of the doctors,” all that heard him were “astonished at his understanding and answers” ([Luke 2:41](/luke#Luke.2.41), etc.).

 Eighteen years pass, of which we have no record beyond this, that he returned to Nazareth and “increased in wisdom and stature, and in favour with God and man” ([Luke 2:52](/luke#Luke.2.52)).

 He entered on his public ministry when he was about thirty years of age. It is generally reckoned to have extended to about three years. “Each of these years had peculiar features of its own.",2.0,person,jesus_904,jesus_904,

Jew,3471,j-p328.2,Jew,"The name derived from the patriarch Judah, at first given to one belonging to the tribe of Judah or to the separate kingdom of Judah ([2 Kings 16:6](/2kgs#2Kgs.16.6); [25:25](/2kgs#2Kgs.25.25); [Jer. 32:12](/jer#Jer.32.12); [38:19](/jer#Jer.38.19); [40:11](/jer#Jer.40.11); [41:3](/jer#Jer.41.3)), in contradistinction from those belonging to the kingdom of the ten tribes, who were called Israelites.

 During the Captivity, and after the Restoration, the name, however, was extended to all the Hebrew nation without distinction ([Esther 3:6](/esth#Esth.3.6), [10](/esth#Esth.3.10); [Dan. 3:8](/dan#Dan.3.8), [12](/dan#Dan.3.12); [Ezra 4:12](/ezra#Ezra.4.12); [5:1](/ezra#Ezra.5.1), [5](/ezra#Ezra.5.5)).

 Originally this people were called Hebrews ([Gen. 39:14](/gen#Gen.39.14); [40:15](/gen#Gen.40.15); [Ex. 2:7](/exod#Exod.2.7); [3:18](/exod#Exod.3.18); [5:3](/exod#Exod.5.3); [1 Sam. 4:6](/1sam#1Sam.4.6), [9](/1sam#1Sam.4.9), etc.), but after the Exile this name fell into disuse. But Paul was styled a Hebrew ([2 Cor. 11:22](/2cor#2Cor.11.22); [Phil. 3:5](/phil#Phil.3.5)).

 The history of the Jewish nation is interwoven with the history of Palestine and with the narratives of the lives of their rulers and chief men. They are now [1897] dispersed over all lands, and to this day remain a separate people, “without a king, and without a prince, and without a sacrifice, and without an image [R.V. ‘pillar,’ marg. ‘obelisk’], and without an ephod, and without teraphim” ([Hos. 3:4](/hos#Hos.3.4)). Till about the beginning of the present century [1800] they were everywhere greatly oppressed, and often cruelly persecuted; but now their condition is greatly improved, and they are admitted in most European countries to all the rights of free citizens. In 1860 the “Jewish disabilities” were removed, and they were admitted to a seat in the British Parliament. Their number in all is estimated at about six millions, about four millions being in Europe.

This was the “first time that a king of Israel had allied himself by marriage with a heathen princess; and the alliance was in this case of a peculiarly disastrous kind. Jezebel has stamped her name on history as the representative of all that is designing, crafty, malicious, revengeful, and cruel. She is the first great instigator of persecution against the saints of God. Guided by no principle, restrained by no fear of either God or man, passionate in her attachment to her heathen worship, she spared no pains to maintain idolatry around her in all its splendour. Four hundred and fifty prophets ministered under her care to Baal, besides four hundred prophets of the groves [R.V., ’prophets of the Asherah’], which ate at her table ([1 Kings 18:19](/1kgs#1Kgs.18.19)). The idolatry, too, was of the most debased and sensual kind.” Her conduct was in many respects very disastrous to the kingdom both of Israel and Judah (21:1-29). At length she came to an untimely end. As Jehu rode into the gates of Jezreel, she looked out at the window of the palace, and said, “Had Zimri peace, who slew his master?” He looked up and called to her chamberlains, who instantly threw her from the window, so that she was dashed in pieces on the street, and his horses trod her under their feet. She was immediately consumed by the dogs of the street ([2 Kings 9:7-37](/2kgs#2Kgs.9.7)), according to the word of Elijah the Tishbite ([1 Kings 21:19](/1kgs#1Kgs.21.19)).

His father’s name is nowhere mentioned, although his sepulchre at Bethlehem is mentioned ([2 Sam. 2:32](/2sam#2Sam.2.32)). His two brothers were Abishai and Asahel, the swift of foot, who was killed by Abner ([2 Sam. 2:13-32](/2sam#2Sam.2.13)), whom Joab afterwards treacherously murdered (3:22-27). He afterwards led the assault at the storming of the fortress on Mount Zion, and for this service was raised to the rank of “prince of the king’s army” ([2 Sam. 5:6-10](/2sam#2Sam.5.6); [1 Chr. 27:34](/1chr#1Chr.27.34)). His chief military achievements were, (1) against the allied forces of Syria and Ammon; (2) against Edom ([1 Kings 11:15](/1kgs#1Kgs.11.15), [16](/1kgs#1Kgs.11.16)); and (3) against the Ammonites ([2 Sam. 10:7-19](/2sam#2Sam.10.7); [11:1](/2sam#2Sam.11.1), [11](/2sam#2Sam.11.11)). His character is deeply stained by the part he willingly took in the murder of Uriah (11:14-25). He acted apparently from a sense of duty in putting Absalom to death (18:1-14). David was unmindful of the many services Joab had rendered to him, and afterwards gave the command of the army to Amasa, Joab’s cousin ([2 Sam. 20:1-13](/2sam#2Sam.20.1); [19:13](/2sam#2Sam.19.13)). When David was dying Joab espoused the cause of Adonijah in preference to that of Solomon. He was afterwards slain by Benaiah, by the command of Solomon, in accordance with his father’s injunction ([2 Sam. 3:29](/2sam#2Sam.3.29); [20:5-13](/2sam#2Sam.20.5)), at the altar to which he had fled for refuge. Thus this hoary conspirator died without one to lift up a voice in his favour. He was buried in his own property in the “wilderness,” probably in the north-east of Jerusalem ([1 Kings 2:5](/1kgs#1Kgs.2.5), [28](/1kgs#1Kgs.2.28)-34).

"Job, Book of",3515,j-p368.5,"Job, Book of","A great diversity of opinion exists as to the authorship of this book. From internal evidence, such as the similarity of sentiment and language to those in the Psalms and Proverbs (see [Ps. 88](/ps#Ps.88) and 89), the prevalence of the idea of “wisdom,” and the style and character of the composition, it is supposed by some to have been written in the time of David and Solomon. Others argue that it was written by Job himself, or by Elihu, or Isaiah, or perhaps more probably by Moses, who was “learned in all the wisdom of the Egyptians, and mighty in words and deeds” ([Acts 7:22](/acts#Acts.7.22)). He had opportunities in Midian for obtaining the knowledge of the facts related. But the authorship is altogether uncertain.

 As to the character of the book, it is a historical poem, one of the greatest and sublimest poems in all literature. Job was a historical person, and the localities and names were real and not fictious. It is “one of the grandest portions of the inspired Scriptures, a heavenly-repleished storehouse of comfort and instruction, the patriarchal Bible, and a precious monument of primitive theology. It is to the Old Testament what the Epistle to the Romans is to the New.” It is a didactic narrative in a dramatic form.

 This book was apparently well known in the days of Ezekiel, B.C. 600 ([Ezek. 14:14](/ezek#Ezek.14.14)). It formed a part of the sacred Scriptures used by our Lord and his apostles, and is referred to as a part of the inspired Word ([Heb. 12:5](/heb#Heb.12.5); [1 Cor. 3:19](/1cor#1Cor.3.19)).

 The subject of the book is the trial of Job, its occasion, nature, endurance, and issue. It exhibits the harmony of the truths of revelation and the dealings of Providence, which are seen to be at once inscrutable, just, and merciful. It shows the blessedness of the truly pious, even amid sore afflictions, and thus ministers comfort and hope to tried believers of every age. It is a book of manifold instruction, and is profitable for doctrine, for reproof, for correction, and for instruction in righteousness ([2 Tim. 3:16](/2tim#2Tim.3.16)).

He was one, probably the younger, of the sons of Zebedee ([Matt. 4:21](/matt#Matt.4.21)) and Salome ([Matt. 27:56](/matt#Matt.27.56); comp. [Mark 15:40](/mark#Mark.15.40)), and was born at Bethsaida. His father was apparently a man of some wealth (comp. [Mark 1:20](/mark#Mark.1.20); [Luke 5:3](/luke#Luke.5.3); [John 19:27](/john#John.19.27)). He was doubtless trained in all that constituted the ordinary education of Jewish youth. When he grew up he followed the occupation of a fisherman on the Lake of Galilee. When John the Baptist began his ministry in the wilderness of Judea, John, with many others, gathered round him, and was deeply influenced by his teaching. There he heard the announcement, “Behold the Lamb of God,” and forthwith, on the invitation of Jesus, became a disciple and ranked among his followers ([John 1:36](/john#John.1.36), [37](/john#John.1.37)) for a time. He and his brother then returned to their former avocation, for how long is uncertain. Jesus again called them ([Matt. 4](/matt#Matt.4): 21; [Luke 5:1-11](/luke#Luke.5.1)), and now they left all and permanently attached themselves to the company of his disciples. He became one of the innermost circle ([Mark 5:37](/mark#Mark.5.37); [Matt. 17:1](/matt#Matt.17.1); [26:37](/matt#Matt.26.37); [Mark 13:3](/mark#Mark.13.3)). He was the disciple whom Jesus loved. In zeal and intensity of character he was a “Boanerges” ([Mark 3:17](/mark#Mark.3.17)). This spirit once and again broke out ([Matt. 20:20-24](/matt#Matt.20.20); [Mark 10:35-41](/mark#Mark.10.35); [Luke 9:49](/luke#Luke.9.49), [54](/luke#Luke.9.54)). At the betrayal he and Peter follow Christ afar off, while the others betake themselves to hasty flight ([John 18:15](/john#John.18.15)). At the trial he follows Christ into the council chamber, and thence to the praetorium (18:16, 19, 28) and to the place of crucifixion (19:26, 27). To him and Peter, Mary first conveys tidings of the resurrection (20:2), and they are the first to go and see what her strange words mean. After the resurrection he and Peter again return to the Sea of Galilee, where the Lord reveals himself to them (21:1, 7). We find Peter and John frequently after this together ([Acts 3:1](/acts#Acts.3.1); [4:13](/acts#Acts.4.13)). John remained apparently in Jerusalem as the leader of the church there ([Acts 15:6](/acts#Acts.15.6); [Gal. 2:9](/gal#Gal.2.9)). His subsequent history is unrecorded. He was not there, however, at the time of Paul’s last visit ([Acts 21:15-40](/acts#Acts.21.15)). He appears to have retired to Ephesus, but at what time is unknown. The seven churches of Asia were the objects of his special care ([Rev. 1:11](/rev#Rev.1.11)). He suffered under persecution, and was banished to Patmos (1:9); whence he again returned to Ephesus, where he died, probably about A.D. 98, having outlived all or nearly all the friends and companions even of his maturer years.

The purpose of the apostle (1:1-4) is to declare the Word of Life to those to whom he writes, in order that they might be united in fellowship with the Father and his Son Jesus Christ. He shows that the means of union with God are, (1) on the part of Christ, his atoning work (1:7; 2:2; 3:5; 4:10, 14; 5:11, 12) and his advocacy (2:1); and (2), on the part of man, holiness (1:6), obedience (2:3), purity (3:3), faith (3:23; 4:3; 5:5), and love (2:7, 8; 3:14; 4:7; 5:1).",0.0,unmatched,unmatched,,
"John, Gospel of",3544,j-p392.1,"John, Gospel of","The genuineness of this Gospel, i.e., the fact that the apostle John was its author, is beyond all reasonable doubt. In recent times, from about 1820, many attempts have been made to impugn its genuineness, but without success.

 The design of John in writing this Gospel is stated by himself ([John 20:31](/john#John.20.31)). It was at one time supposed that he wrote for the purpose of supplying the omissions of the synoptical, i.e., of the first three, Gospels, but there is no evidence for this. “There is here no history of Jesus and his teaching after the manner of the other evangelists. But there is in historical form a representation of the Christian faith in relation to the person of Christ as its central point; and in this representation there is a picture on the one hand of the antagonism of the world to the truth revealed in him, and on the other of the spiritual blessedness of the few who yield themselves to him as the Light of life” (Reuss).

 After the prologue (1:1-5), the historical part of the book begins with verse 6, and consists of two parts. The first part (1:6-ch. 12) contains the history of our Lord’s public ministry from the time of his introduction to it by John the Baptist to its close. The second part (ch. 13-21) presents our Lord in the retirement of private life and in his intercourse with his immediate followers (13-17), and gives an account of his sufferings and of his appearances to the disciples after his resurrection (18-21).

 The peculiarities of this Gospel are the place it gives (1) to the mystical relation of the Son to the Father, and (2) of the Redeemer to believers; (3) the announcement of the Holy Ghost as the Comforter; (4) the prominence given to love as an element in the Christian character. It was obviously addressed primarily to Christians.

John the Baptist,3546,j-p398.1,John the Baptist,"The “forerunner of our Lord.” We have but fragmentary and imperfect accounts of him in the Gospels. He was of priestly descent. His father, Zacharias, was a priest of the course of Abia ([1 Chr. 24:10](/1chr#1Chr.24.10)), and his mother, Elisabeth, was of the daughters of Aaron ([Luke 1:5](/luke#Luke.1.5)). The mission of John was the subject of prophecy ([Matt. 3:3](/matt#Matt.3.3); [Isa. 40:3](/isa#Isa.40.3); [Mal. 3:1](/mal#Mal.3.1)). His birth, which took place six months before that of Jesus, was foretold by an angel. Zacharias, deprived of the power of speech as a token of God’s truth and a reproof of his own incredulity with reference to the birth of his son, had the power of speech restored to him on the occasion of his circumcision ([Luke 1:64](/luke#Luke.1.64)). After this no more is recorded of him for thirty years than what is mentioned in [Luke 1:80](/luke#Luke.1.80). John was a Nazarite from his birth ([Luke 1:15](/luke#Luke.1.15); [Num. 6:1-12](/num#Num.6.1)). He spent his early years in the mountainous tract of Judah lying between Jerusalem and the Dead Sea ([Matt. 3:1-12](/matt#Matt.3.1)).

 At length he came forth into public life, and great multitudes from “every quarter” were attracted to him. The sum of his preaching was the necessity of repentance. He denounced the Sadducees and Pharisees as a “generation of vipers,” and warned them of the folly of trusting to external privileges ([Luke 3:8](/luke#Luke.3.8)). “As a preacher, John was eminently practical and discriminating. Self-love and covetousness were the prevalent sins of the people at large. On them, therefore, he enjoined charity and consideration for others. The publicans he cautioned against extortion, the soldiers against crime and plunder.” His doctrine and manner of life roused the entire south of Palestine, and the people from all parts flocked to the place where he was, on the banks of the Jordan. There he baptized thousands unto repentance.

 The fame of John reached the ears of Jesus in Nazareth ([Matt. 3:5](/matt#Matt.3.5)), and he came from Galilee to Jordan to be baptized of John, on the special ground that it became him to “fulfil all righteousness” (3:15). John’s special office ceased with the baptism of Jesus, who must now “increase” as the King come to his kingdom. He continued, however, for a while to bear testimony to the Messiahship of Jesus. He pointed him out to his disciples, saying, “Behold the Lamb of God.” His public ministry was suddenly (after about six months probably) brought to a close by his being cast into prison by Herod, whom he had reproved for the sin of having taken to himself the wife of his brother Philip ([Luke 3:19](/luke#Luke.3.19)). He was shut up in the castle of Machaerus (q.v.), a fortress on the southern extremity of Peraea, 9 miles east of the Dead Sea, and here he was beheaded. His disciples, having consigned the headless body to the grave, went and told Jesus all that had occurred ([Matt. 14:3-12](/matt#Matt.14.3)). John’s death occurred apparently just before the third Passover of our Lord’s ministry.

 Jonah and his story is referred to by our Lord ([Matt. 12:39](/matt#Matt.12.39), [40](/matt#Matt.12.40); [Luke 11:29](/luke#Luke.11.29)), a fact to which the greatest weight must be attached. It is impossible to interpret this reference on any other theory. This one argument is of sufficient importance to settle the whole question. No theories devised for the purpose of getting rid of difficulties can stand against such a proof that the book is a veritable history.

 There is every reason to believe that this book was written by Jonah himself. It gives an account of (1) his divine commission to go to Nineveh, his disobedience, and the punishment following (1:1-17); (2) his prayer and miraculous deliverance (1:17-2:10); (3) the second commission given to him, and his prompt obedience in delivering the message from God, and its results in the repentance of the Ninevites, and God’s long-sparing mercy toward them (ch. 3); (4) Jonah’s displeasure at God’s merciful decision, and the rebuke tendered to the impatient prophet (ch. 4). Nineveh was spared after Jonah’s mission for more than a century. The history of Jonah may well be regarded “as a part of that great onward movement which was before the Law and under the Law; which gained strength and volume as the fulness of the times drew near.”, Perowne’s Jonah.",0.0,person,jonah_1689,,

Like his father, he was a man of great strength and activity ([2 Sam. 1:23](/2sam#2Sam.1.23)), and excelled in archery and slinging ([1 Chr. 12:2](/1chr#1Chr.12.2);[2 Sam. 1:22](/2sam#2Sam.1.22)).

It is one of the oldest towns in Asia. It was and still is the chief sea-port of Judea. It was never wrested from the Phoenicians. It became a Jewish town only in the second century B.C. It was from this port that Jonah “took ship to flee from the presence of the Lord” ([Jonah 1:3](/jonah#Jonah.1.3)). To this place also the wood cut in Lebanon by Hiram’s men for Solomon was brought in floats ([2 Chr. 2:16](/2chr#2Chr.2.16)); and here the material for the building of the second temple was also landed ([Ezra 3:7](/ezra#Ezra.3.7)). At Joppa, in the house of Simon the tanner, “by the sea-side,” Peter resided “many days,” and here, “on the house-top,” he had his “vision of tolerance” ([Acts 9:36-43](/acts#Acts.9.36)). It bears the modern name of Jaffa, and exibituds all the decrepitude and squalor of cities ruled over by the Turks. “Scarcely any other town has been so often overthrown, sacked, pillaged, burned, and rebuilt.” Its present population is said to be about 16,000.

Jordan 3,3587,j-p433.2,Jordan,"But besides these two historical fountains there is a third, called the Hasbany, which rises in the bottom of a valley at the western base of Hermon, 12 miles north of Tell-el-Kady. It joins the main stream about a mile below the junction of the Leddan and the Banias. The river thus formed is at this point about 45 feet wide, and flows in a channel from 12 to 20 feet below the plain. After this it flows, “with a swift current and a much-twisted course,” through a marshy plain for some 6 miles, when it falls into the Lake Huleh, “the waters of Merom” (q.v.).

 During this part of its course the Jordan has descended about 1,100 feet. At Banias it is 1,080 feet above sea-level. Flowing from the southern extremity of Lake Huleh, here almost on a level with the sea, it flows for 2 miles “through a waste of islets and papyrus,” and then for 9 miles through a narrow gorge in a foaming torrent onward to the Sea of Galilee (q.v.).

 “In the whole valley of the Jordan from the Lake Huleh to the Sea of Galilee there is not a single settled inhabitant. Along the whole eastern bank of the river and the lakes, from the base of Hermon to the ravine of Hieromax, a region of great fertility, 30 miles long by 7 or 8 wide, there are only some three inhabited villages. The western bank is almost as desolate. Ruins are numerous enough. Every mile or two is an old site of town or village, now well nigh hid beneath a dense jungle of thorns and thistles. The words of Scripture here recur to us with peculiar force: ‘I will make your cities waste, and bring your sanctuaries unto desolation...And I will bring the land into desolation: and your enemies which dwell therein shall be astonished at it...And your land shall be desolate, and your cities waste. Then shall the land enjoy her sabbaths, as long as it lieth desolate’ ([Lev. 26:31-34](/lev#Lev.26.31)).”, Dr. Porter’s Handbook.

 From the Sea of Galilee, at the level of 682 feet below the Mediterranean, the river flows through a long, low plain called “the region of Jordan” ([Matt. 3:5](/matt#Matt.3.5)), and by the modern Arabs the Ghor, or “sunken plain.” This section is properly the Jordan of Scripture. Down through the midst of the “plain of Jordan” there winds a ravine varying in breadth from 200 yards to half a mile, and in depth from 40 to 150 feet. Through it the Jordan flows in a rapid, rugged, tortuous course down to the Dead Sea. The whole distance from the southern extremity of the Sea of Galilee to the Dead Sea is in a straight line about 65 miles, but following the windings of the river about 200 miles, during which it falls 618 feet. The total length of the Jordan from Banias is about 104 miles in a straight line, during which it falls 2,380 feet.

 The first historical notice of the Jordan is in the account of the separation of Abraham and Lot ([Gen. 13:10](/gen#Gen.13.10)). “Lot beheld the plain of Jordan as the garden of the Lord.” Jacob crossed and recrossed “this Jordan” (32:10). The Israelites passed over it as “on dry ground” ([Josh. 3:17](/josh#Josh.3.17); [Ps. 114:3](/ps#Ps.114.3)). Twice afterwards its waters were miraculously divided at the same spot by Elijah and Elisha ([2 Kings 2:8](/2kgs#2Kgs.2.8), [14](/2kgs#2Kgs.2.14)).

 The Jordan is mentioned in the Old Testament about one hundred and eighty times, and in the New Testament fifteen times. The chief events in gospel history connected with it are (1) John the Baptist’s ministry, when “there went out to him Jerusalem, and all Judaea, and were baptized of him in Jordan” ([Matt. 3:6](/matt#Matt.3.6)).",5.0,unmatched,unmatched,,plain_of_jordan_654

Joseph 1,3592,j-p441.3,Joseph,"The elder of the two sons of Jacob by Rachel ([Gen. 30:23](/gen#Gen.30.23), [24](/gen#Gen.30.24)), who, on the occasion of his birth, said, “God hath taken away [Heb. ‘asaph] my reproach.” “The Lord shall add [Heb. yoseph] to me another son” ([Gen. 30:24](/gen#Gen.30.24)). He was a child of probably six years of age when his father returned from Haran to Canaan and took up his residence in the old patriarchal town of Hebron. “Now Israel loved Joseph more than all his children, because he was the son of his old age,” and he “made him a long garment with sleeves” ([Gen. 37:3](/gen#Gen.37.3), R.V. marg.), i.e., a garment long and full, such as was worn by the children of nobles. This seems to be the correct rendering of the words. The phrase, however, may also be rendered, “a coat of many pieces”, i.e., a patchwork of many small pieces of divers colours.

 When he was about seventeen years old Joseph incurred the jealous hatred of his brothers ([Gen. 37:4](/gen#Gen.37.4)). They “hated him, and could not speak peaceably unto him.” Their anger was increased when he told them his dreams (37:11).

 Jacob desiring to hear tidings of his sons, who had gone to Shechem with their flocks, some 60 miles from Hebron, sent Joseph as his messenger to make inquiry regarding them. Joseph found that they had left Shechem for Dothan, whither he followed them. As soon as they saw him coming they began to plot against him, and would have killed him had not Reuben interposed. They ultimately sold him to a company of Ishmaelite merchants for twenty pieces (shekels) of silver (about $2, 10s.), ten pieces less than the current value of a slave, for “they cared little what they had for him, if so be they were rid of him.” These merchants were going down with a varied assortment of merchandise to the Egyptian market, and thither they conveyed him, and ultimately sold him as a slave to Potiphar, an “officer of Pharaoh’s, and captain of the guard” ([Gen. 37:36](/gen#Gen.37.36)). “The Lord blessed the Egyptian’s house for Joseph’s sake,” and Potiphar made him overseer over his house. At length a false charge having been brought against him by Potiphar’s wife, he was at once cast into the state prison (39; 40), where he remained for at least two years. After a while the “chief of the cupbearers” and the “chief of the bakers” of Pharaoh’s household were cast into the same prison (40:2). Each of these new prisoners dreamed a dream in the same night, which Joseph interpreted, the event occurring as he had said.

 This led to Joseph’s being remembered subsequently by the chief butler when Pharaoh also dreamed. At his suggestion Joseph was brought from prison to interpret the king’s dreams. Pharaoh was well pleased with Joseph’s wisdom in interpreting his dreams, and with his counsel with reference to the events then predicted; and he set him over all the land of Egypt ([Gen. 41:46](/gen#Gen.41.46)), and gave him the name of Zaphnath-paaneah. He was married to Asenath, the daughter of the priest of On, and thus became a member of the priestly class. Joseph was now about thirty years of age.

 As Joseph had interpreted, seven years of plenty came, during which he stored up great abundance of corn in granaries built for the purpose. These years were followed by seven years of famine “over all the face of the earth,” when “all countries came into Egypt to Joseph to buy corn” ([Gen. 41:56](/gen#Gen.41.56), [57](/gen#Gen.41.57); 47:13, 14). Thus “Joseph gathered up all the money that was in the land of Egypt, and in the land of Canaan, for the corn which they bought.” Afterwards all the cattle and all the land, and at last the Egyptians themselves, became the property of Pharaoh.

 During this period of famine Joseph’s brethren also came down to Egypt to buy corn. The history of his dealings with them, and of the manner in which he at length made himself known to them, is one of the most interesting narratives that can be read ([Gen. 42](/gen#Gen.42)-45). Joseph directed his brethren to return and bring Jacob and his family to the land of Egypt, saying, “I will give you the good of the land of Egypt, and ye shall eat the fat of the land. Regard not your stuff; for the good of all the land is yours.” Accordingly Jacob and his family, to the number of threescore and ten souls, together with “all that they had,” went down to Egypt. They were settled in the land of Goshen, where Joseph met his father, and “fell on his neck, and wept on his neck a good while” ([Gen. 46:29](/gen#Gen.46.29)).

 The excavations of Dr. Naville have shown the land of Goshen to be the Wady Tumilat, between Ismailia and Zagazig. In Goshen (Egyptian Qosem) they had pasture for their flocks, were near the Asiatic frontier of Egypt, and were out of the way of the Egyptian people. An inscription speaks of it as a district given up to the wandering shepherds of Asia.

 Jacob at length died, and in fulfilment of a promise which he had exacted, Joseph went up to Canaan to bury his father in “the field of Ephron the Hittite” ([Gen. 47:29-31](/gen#Gen.47.29); [50:1-14](/gen#Gen.50.1)). This was the last recorded act of Joseph, who again returned to Egypt.

 “The ‘Story of the Two Brothers,’ an Egyptian romance written for the son of the Pharaoh of the Oppression, contains an episode very similar to the Biblical account of Joseph’s treatment by Potiphar’s wife. Potiphar and Potipherah are the Egyptian Pa-tu-pa-Ra, ‘the gift of the sun-god.’ The name given to Joseph, Zaphnath-paaneah, is probably the Egyptian Zaf-nti-pa-ankh, ‘nourisher of the living one,’ i.e., of the Pharaoh. There are many instances in the inscriptions of foreigners in Egypt receiving Egyptian names, and rising to the highest offices of state.”

 By his wife Asenath, Joseph had two sons, Manasseh and Ephraim ([Gen. 41:50](/gen#Gen.41.50)). Joseph having obtained a promise from his brethren that when the time should come that God would “bring them unto the land which he sware to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob,” they would carry up his bones out of Egypt, at length died, at the age of one hundred and ten years; and “they embalmed him, and he was put in a coffin” ([Gen. 50:26](/gen#Gen.50.26)). This promise was faithfully observed. Their descendants, long after, when the Exodus came, carried the body about with them during their forty years’ wanderings, and at length buried it in Shechem, in the parcel of ground which Jacob bought from the sons of Hamor ([Josh. 24:32](/josh#Josh.24.32); comp. [Gen. 33:19](/gen#Gen.33.19)). With the death of Joseph the patriarchal age of the history of Israel came to a close.

 The Pharaoh of Joseph’s elevation was probably Apepi, or Apopis, the last of the Hyksos kings. Some, however, think that Joseph came to Egypt in the reign of Thothmes III. (see  PHARAOH), long after the expulsion of the Hyksos.

 The name Joseph denotes the two tribes of Ephraim and Manasseh in [Deut. 33:13-17](/deut#Deut.33.13); the kingdom of Israel in [Ezek. 37:16](/ezek#Ezek.37.16), [19](/ezek#Ezek.37.19), [Amos 5:6](/amos#Amos.5.6); and the whole covenant people of Israel in [Ps. 81:4](/ps#Ps.81.4).",1.0,person,joseph_1710,joseph_1710,

Joshua,3598,j-p458.3,Joshua,"Jehovah is his help, or Jehovah the Saviour. The son of Nun, of the tribe of Ephraim, the successor of Moses as the leader of Israel. He is called Jehoshua in [Num. 13:16](/num#Num.13.16) (A.V.), and Jesus in [Acts 7:45](/acts#Acts.7.45) and [Heb. 4:8](/heb#Heb.4.8) (R.V., Joshua).

 He was born in Egypt, and was probably of the age of Caleb, with whom he is generally associated. He shared in all the events of the Exodus, and held the place of commander of the host of the Israelites at their great battle against the Amalekites in Rephidim ([Ex. 17:8-16](/exod#Exod.17.8)). He became Moses’ minister or servant, and accompanied him part of the way when he ascended Mount Sinai to receive the two tables ([Ex. 32:17](/exod#Exod.32.17)). He was also one of the twelve who were sent on by Moses to explore the land of Canaan ([Num. 13:16](/num#Num.13.16), [17](/num#Num.13.17)), and only he and Caleb gave an encouraging report. Under the direction of God, Moses, before his death, invested Joshua in a public and solemn manner with authority over the people as his successor ([Deut. 31:23](/deut#Deut.31.23)). The people were encamped at Shittim when he assumed the command ([Josh. 1:1](/josh#Josh.1.1)); and crossing the Jordan, they encamped at Gilgal, where, having circumcised the people, he kept the Passover, and was visited by the Captain of the Lord’s host, who spoke to him encouraging words (1:1-9).

 Now began the wars of conquest which Joshua carried on for many years, the record of which is in the book which bears his name. Six nations and thirty-one kings were conquered by him ([Josh. 11:18-23](/josh#Josh.11.18); [12:24](/josh#Josh.12.24)). Having thus subdued the Canaanites, Joshua divided the land among the tribes, Timnath-serah in Mount Ephraim being assigned to himself as his own inheritance.

 His work being done, he died, at the age of one hundred and ten years, twenty-five years after having crossed the Jordan. He was buried in his own city of Timnath-serah ([Josh. 24](/josh#Josh.24)); and “the light of Israel for the time faded away.”

 Joshua has been regarded as a type of Christ ([Heb. 4:8](/heb#Heb.4.8)) in the following particulars: (1) In the name common to both; (2) Joshua brings the people into the possession of the Promised Land, as Jesus brings his people to the heavenly Canaan; and (3) as Joshua succeeded Moses, so the Gospel succeeds the Law.

 The character of Joshua is thus well sketched by Edersheim:, “Born a slave in Egypt, he must have been about forty years old at the time of the Exodus. Attached to the person of Moses, he led Israel in the first decisive battle against Amalek ([Ex. 17:9](/exod#Exod.17.9), [13](/exod#Exod.17.13)), while Moses in the prayer of faith held up to heaven the God-given ‘rod.’ It was no doubt on that occasion that his name was changed from Oshea, ‘help,’ to Jehoshua, ‘Jehovah is help’ ([Num. 13:16](/num#Num.13.16)).

The Canaanites had sunk into a state of immorality and corruption so foul and degrading that they had to be rooted out of the land with the edge of the sword. “The Israelites’ sword, in its bloodiest executions, wrought a work of mercy for all the countries of the earth to the very end of the world.”

 This book resembles the Acts of the Apostles in the number and variety of historical incidents it records, and in its many references to persons and places; and as in the latter case the epistles of Paul (see Paley’s Horae Paul.) confirm its historical accuracy by their incidental allusions and “undesigned coincidences,” so in the former modern discoveries confirm its historicity. The Amarna tablets (see  ADONIZEDEC) are among the most remarkable discoveries of the age. Dating from about B.C. 1480 down to the time of Joshua, and consisting of official communications from Amorite, Phoenician, and Philistine chiefs to the king of Egypt, they afford a glimpse into the actual condition of Palestine prior to the Hebrew invasion, and illustrate and confirm the history of the conquest. A letter, also still extant, from a military officer, “master of the captains of Egypt,” dating from near the end of the reign of Rameses II., gives a curious account of a journey, probably official, which he undertook through Palestine as far north as to Aleppo, and an insight into the social condition of the country at that time. Among the things brought to light by this letter and the Amarna tablets is the state of confusion and decay that had now fallen on Egypt. The Egyptian garrisons that had held possession of Palestine from the time of Thothmes III., some two hundred years before, had now been withdrawn. The way was thus opened for the Hebrews. In the history of the conquest there is no mention of Joshua having encountered any Egyptian force. The tablets contain many appeals to the king of Egypt for help against the inroads of the Hebrews, but no help seems ever to have been sent. Is not this just such a state of things as might have been anticipated as the result of the disaster of the Exodus? In many points, as shown under various articles, the progress of the conquest is remarkably illustrated by the tablets. The value of modern discoveries in their relation to Old Testament history has been thus well described:

 “The difficulty of establishing the charge of lack of historical credibility, as against the testimony of the Old Testament, has of late years greatly increased. The outcome of recent excavations and explorations is altogether against it. As long as these books contained, in the main, the only known accounts of the events they mention, there was some plausibility in the theory that perhaps these accounts were written rather to teach moral lessons than to preserve an exact knowledge of events. It was easy to say in those times men had not the historic sense. But the recent discoveries touch the events recorded in the Bible at very many different points in many different generations, mentioning the same persons, countries, peoples, events that are mentioned in the Bible, and showing beyond question that these were strictly historic. The point is not that the discoveries confirm the correctness of the Biblical statements, though that is commonly the case, but that the discoveries show that the peoples of those ages had the historic sense, and, specifically, that the Biblical narratives they touch are narratives of actual occurrences.”",5.0,unmatched,unmatched,,
Josiah,3605,j-p470.1,Josiah,"Healed by Jehovah, or Jehovah will support. The son of Amon, and his successor on the throne of Judah ([2 Kings 22:1](/2kgs#2Kgs.22.1); [2 Chr. 34:1](/2chr#2Chr.34.1)). His history is contained in [2 Kings 22](/2kgs#2Kgs.22), [23](/2kgs#2Kgs.23). He stands foremost among all the kings of the line of David for unswerving loyalty to Jehovah (23:25). He “did that which was right in the sight of the Lord, and walked in all the way of David his father.” He ascended the throne at the early age of eight years, and it appears that not till eight years afterwards did he begin “to seek after the God of David his father.” At that age he devoted himself to God. He distinguished himself by beginning a war of extermination against the prevailing idolatry, which had practically been the state religion for some seventy years ([2 Chr. 34:3](/2chr#2Chr.34.3); comp. [Jer. 25:3](/jer#Jer.25.3), [11](/jer#Jer.25.11), [29](/jer#Jer.25.29)).

 In the eighteenth year of his reign he proceeded to repair and beautify the temple, which by time and violence had become sorely dilapidated ([2 Kings 22:3](/2kgs#2Kgs.22.3), [5](/2kgs#2Kgs.22.5), [6](/2kgs#2Kgs.22.6); 23:23; [2 Chr. 34:11](/2chr#2Chr.34.11)). While this work was being carried on, Hilkiah, the high priest, discovered a roll, which was probably the original copy of the law, the entire Pentateuch, written by Moses.

 When this book was read to him, the king was alarmed by the things it contained, and sent for Huldah, the “prophetess,” for her counsel. She spoke to him words of encouragement, telling him that he would be gathered to his fathers in peace before the threatened days of judgment came. Josiah immediately gathered the people together, and engaged them in a renewal of their ancient national covenant with God. The Passover was then celebrated, as in the days of his great predecessor, Hezekiah, with unusual magnificence. Nevertheless, “the Lord turned not from the fierceness of his great wrath wherewith his anger was kindled against Judah” ([2 Kings 22:3-20](/2kgs#2Kgs.22.3); [23:21-27](/2kgs#2Kgs.23.21); [2 Chr. 35:1-19](/2chr#2Chr.35.1)). During the progress of this great religious revolution Jeremiah helped it on by his earnest exhortations.

 Soon after this, Pharaoh-Necho II. (q.v.), king of Egypt, in an expedition against the king of Assyria, with the view of gaining possession of Carchemish, sought a passage through the territory of Judah for his army. This Josiah refused to permit. He had probably entered into some new alliance with the king of Assyria, and faithful to his word he sought to oppose the progress of Necho.

 The army of Judah went out and encountered that of Egypt at Megiddo, on the verge of the plain of Esdraelon. Josiah went into the field in disguise, and was fatally wounded by a random arrow. His attendants conveyed him toward Jerusalem, but had only reached Hadadrimmon, a few miles south of Megiddo, when he died ([2 Kings 23:28](/2kgs#2Kgs.23.28), [30](/2kgs#2Kgs.23.30); comp. [2 Chr. 35:20-27](/2chr#2Chr.35.20)), after a reign of thirty-one years. He was buried with the greatest honours in fulfilment of Huldah’s prophecy ([2 Kings 22:20](/2kgs#2Kgs.22.20); comp. [Jer. 34:5](/jer#Jer.34.5)). Jeremiah composed a funeral elegy on this the best of the kings of Israel ([Lam. 4:20](/lam#Lam.4.20); [2 Chr. 35:25](/2chr#2Chr.35.25)).

Jubilee,3618,j-p484.2,Jubilee,"A joyful shout or clangour of trumpets, the name of the great semi-centennial festival of the Hebrews. It lasted for a year.

All landed property during that year reverted to its original owner (13-34; 27:16-24), and all who were slaves were set free (25:39-54), and all debts were remitted.

 The return of the jubilee year was proclaimed by a blast of trumpets which sounded throughout the land. There is no record in Scripture of the actual observance of this festival, but there are numerous allusions ([Isa. 5:7](/isa#Isa.5.7), [8](/isa#Isa.5.8), [9](/isa#Isa.5.9), [10](/isa#Isa.5.10); 61:1, 2; [Ezek. 7:12](/ezek#Ezek.7.12), [13](/ezek#Ezek.7.13); [Neh. 5:1-19](/neh#Neh.5.1); [2 Chr. 36:21](/2chr#2Chr.36.21)) which place it beyond a doubt that it was observed.

 The advantages of this institution were manifold. “1. It would prevent the accumulation of land on the part of a few to the detriment of the community at large. 2. It would render it impossible for any one to be born to absolute poverty, since every one had his hereditary land. 3. It would preclude those inequalities which are produced by extremes of riches and poverty, and which make one man domineer over another. 4. It would utterly do away with slavery. 5. It would afford a fresh opportunity to those who were reduced by adverse circumstances to begin again their career of industry in the patrimony which they had temporarily forfeited. 6.

It was very small in extent, being only about the size of the Scottish county of Perth.

 For the first sixty years the kings of Judah aimed at re-establishing their authority over the kingdom of the other ten tribes, so that there was a state of perpetual war between them. For the next eighty years there was no open war between them. For the most part they were in friendly alliance, co-operating against their common enemies, especially against Damascus. For about another century and a half Judah had a somewhat checkered existence after the termination of the kingdom of Israel till its final overthrow in the destruction of the temple (B.C. 588) by Nebuzar-adan, who was captain of Nebuchadnezzar’s body-guard ([2 Kings 25:8-21](/2kgs#2Kgs.25.8)).

Its number increased in the wilderness (26:22). Caleb, the son of Jephunneh, represented the tribe as one of the spies (13:6; 34:19).

Afterwards he owned his sin with “an exceeding bitter cry,” and cast the money he had received as the wages of his iniquity down on the floor of the sanctuary, and “departed and went and hanged himself” ([Matt. 27:5](/matt#Matt.27.5)).

"Jude, Epistle of",3639,j-p510.1,"Jude, Epistle of","The author was “Judas, the brother of James” the Less ([Jude 1](/jude#Jude.1.1):1), called also Lebbaeus ([Matt. 10:3](/matt#Matt.10.3)) and Thaddaeus ([Mark 3:18](/mark#Mark.3.18)). The genuineness of this epistle was early questioned, and doubts regarding it were revived at the time of the Reformation; but the evidences in support of its claims are complete. It has all the marks of having proceeded from the writer whose name it bears.

 There is nothing very definite to determine the time and place at which it was written. It was apparently written in the later period of the apostolic age, for when it was written there were persons still alive who had heard the apostles preach (ver. 17). It may thus have been written about A.D. 66 or 70, and apparently in Palestine.

 The epistle is addressed to Christians in general (ver. 1), and its design is to put them on their guard against the misleading efforts of a certain class of errorists to which they were exposed. The style of the epistle is that of an “impassioned invective, in the impetuous whirlwind of which the writer is hurried along, collecting example after example of divine vengeance on the ungodly; heaping epithet upon epithet, and piling image upon image, and, as it were, labouring for words and images strong enough to depict the polluted character of the licentious apostates against whom he is warning the Church; returning again and again to the subject, as though all language was insufficient to give an adequate idea of their profligacy, and to express his burning hatred of their perversion of the doctrines of the gospel.”

 The striking resemblance this epistle bears to 2 Peter suggests the idea that the author of the one had seen the epistle of the other.

Judge,3640,j-p515.1,Judge,"(Heb. shophet, pl. shophetim), properly a magistrate or ruler, rather than one who judges in the sense of trying a cause. This is the name given to those rulers who presided over the affairs of the Israelites during the interval between the death of Joshua and the accession of Saul ([Judg. 2:18](/judg#Judg.2.18)), a period of general anarchy and confusion. “The office of judges or regents was held during life, but it was not hereditary, neither could they appoint their successors. Their authority was limited by the law alone, and in doubtful cases they were directed to consult the divine King through the priest by Urim and Thummim ([Num. 27:21](/num#Num.27.21)). Their authority extended only over those tribes by whom they had been elected or acknowledged. There was no income attached to their office, and they bore no external marks of dignity. The only cases of direct divine appointment are those of Gideon and Samson, and the latter stood in the peculiar position of having been from before his birth ordained ‘to begin to deliver Israel.’ Deborah was called to deliver Israel, but was already a judge. Samuel was called by the Lord to be a prophet but not a judge, which ensued from the high gifts the people recognized as dwelling in him; and as to Eli, the office of judge seems to have devolved naturally or rather ex officio upon him.” Of five of the judges, Tola ([Judg. 10:1](/judg#Judg.10.1)), Jair (3), Ibzan, Elon, and Abdon (12:8-15), we have no record at all beyond the bare fact that they were judges. Sacred history is not the history of individuals but of the kingdom of God in its onward progress.

 In [Ex. 2:14](/exod#Exod.2.14) Moses is so styled. This fact may indicate that while for revenue purposes the “taskmasters” were over the people, they were yet, just as at a later time when under the Romans, governed by their own rulers.",0.0,unmatched,unmatched,,

 Samson’s exploits probably synchronize with the period immediately preceding the national repentance and reformation under Samuel ([1 Sam. 7:2-6](/1sam#1Sam.7.2)).

 After Samson came Eli, who was both high priest and judge. He directed the civil and religious affairs of the people for forty years, at the close of which the Philistines again invaded the land and oppressed it for twenty years. Samuel was raised up to deliver the people from this oppression, and he judged Israel for some twelve years, when the direction of affairs fell into the hands of Saul, who was anointed king. If Eli and Samuel are included, there were then fifteen judges. But the chronology of this whole period is uncertain.",2.0,unmatched,unmatched,,
"Judges, Book of 3",3644,j-p517.2,"Judges, Book of","The historic section of the book is followed by an appendix (17-21), which has no formal connection with that which goes before. It records (a) the conquest (17, 18) of Laish by a portion of the tribe of Dan; and (b) the almost total extinction of the tribe of Benjamin by the other tribes, in consequence of their assisting the men of Gibeah (19-21). This section properly belongs to the period only a few years after the death of Joshua. It shows the religious and moral degeneracy of the people.

 The author of this book was most probably Samuel. The internal evidence both of the first sixteen chapters and of the appendix warrants this conclusion. It was probably composed during Saul’s reign, or at the very beginning of David’s. The words in 18:30, 31, imply that it was written after the taking of the ark by the Philistines, and after it was set up at Nob ([1 Sam. 21](/1sam#1Sam.21)).

 The rule of judgment is the standard of God’s law as revealed to men, the heathen by the law as written on their hearts ([Luke 12:47](/luke#Luke.12.47), [48](/luke#Luke.12.48); [Rom. 2:12-16](/rom#Rom.2.12)); the Jew who “sinned in the law shall be judged by the law” ([Rom. 2:12](/rom#Rom.2.12)); the Christian enjoying the light of revelation, by the will of God as made known to him ([Matt. 11:20-24](/matt#Matt.11.20); [John 3:19](/john#John.3.19)).

Our Arabs always selected the place of encampment, if possible, in a spot where it grew, in order to be sheltered by it at night from the wind; and during the day, when they often went on in advance of the camels, we found them not unfrequently sitting or sleeping under a bush of retem to shelter them from the sun.

Justification,3660,j-p543.6,Justification,"A forensic term, opposed to condemnation. As regards its nature, it is the judicial act of God, by which he pardons all the sins of those who believe in Christ, and accounts, accepts, and treats them as righteous in the eye of the law, i.e., as conformed to all its demands. In addition to the pardon (q.v.) of sin, justification declares that all the claims of the law are satisfied in respect of the justified. It is the act of a judge and not of a sovereign. The law is not relaxed or set aside, but is declared to be fulfilled in the strictest sense; and so the person justified is declared to be entitled to all the advantages and rewards arising from perfect obedience to the law ([Rom. 5:1-10](/rom#Rom.5.1)).

 It proceeds on the imputing or crediting to the believer by God himself of the perfect righteousness, active and passive, of his Representative and Surety, Jesus Christ ([Rom. 10:3-9](/rom#Rom.10.3)). Justification is not the forgiveness of a man without righteousness, but a declaration that he possesses a righteousness which perfectly and for ever satisfies the law, namely, Christ’s righteousness ([2 Cor. 5:21](/2cor#2Cor.5.21); [Rom. 4:6-8](/rom#Rom.4.6)).

 The sole condition on which this righteousness is imputed or credited to the believer is faith in or on the Lord Jesus Christ. Faith is called a “condition,” not because it possesses any merit, but only because it is the instrument, the only instrument by which the soul appropriates or apprehends Christ and his righteousness ([Rom. 1:17](/rom#Rom.1.17); [3:25](/rom#Rom.3.25), [26](/rom#Rom.3.26); [4:20](/rom#Rom.4.20), [22](/rom#Rom.4.22); [Phil. 3:8-11](/phil#Phil.3.8); [Gal. 2:16](/gal#Gal.2.16)).

 The act of faith which thus secures our justification secures also at the same time our sanctification (q.v.); and thus the doctrine of justification by faith does not lead to licentiousness ([Rom. 6:2-7](/rom#Rom.6.2)).

Kadesh,3667,k-p1.5,Kadesh,"Holy, or Kadesh-Barnea, sacred desert of wandering, a place on the south-eastern border of Palestine, about 165 miles from Horeb.

From this place, in compliance with the desire of the people, Moses sent forth “twelve spies” to spy the land. After examining it in all its districts, the spies brought back an evil report, Joshua and Caleb alone giving a good report of the land (13:18-31). Influenced by the discouraging report, the people abandoned all hope of entering into the Promised Land. They remained a considerable time at Kadesh. Because of their unbelief, they were condemned by God to wander for thirty-eight years in the wilderness. They took their journey from Kadesh into the deserts of Paran, “by way of the Red Sea” ([Deut. 2:1](/deut#Deut.2.1)). (One theory is that during these thirty-eight years they remained in and about Kadesh.)

 At the end of these years of wanderings, the tribes were a second time gathered together at Kadesh. During their stay here at this time Miriam died and was buried. Here the people murmured for want of water, as their forefathers had done formerly at Rephidim; and Moses, irritated by their chidings, “with his rod smote the rock twice,” instead of “speaking to the rock before their eyes,” as the Lord had commanded him (comp. [Num. 27:14](/num#Num.27.14); [Deut. 9:23](/deut#Deut.9.23); [Ps. 106:32](/ps#Ps.106.32), [33](/ps#Ps.106.33)).

Kadesh,3668,k-p4.2,Kadesh,"Holy, or Kadesh-Barnea, sacred desert of wandering, a place on the south-eastern border of Palestine, about 165 miles from Horeb. It lay in the “wilderness” or “desert of Zin” ([Gen. 14:7](/gen#Gen.14.7); [Num. 13:3-26](/num#Num.13.3); [14:29-33](/num#Num.14.29); [20:1](/num#Num.20.1); [27:14](/num#Num.27.14)), on the border of Edom (20:16). From this place, in compliance with the desire of the people, Moses sent forth “twelve spies” to spy the land. After examining it in all its districts, the spies brought back an evil report, Joshua and Caleb alone giving a good report of the land (13:18-31). Influenced by the discouraging report, the people abandoned all hope of entering into the Promised Land. They remained a considerable time at Kadesh. Because of their unbelief, they were condemned by God to wander for thirty-eight years in the wilderness. They took their journey from Kadesh into the deserts of Paran, “by way of the Red Sea” ([Deut. 2:1](/deut#Deut.2.1)). (One theory is that during these thirty-eight years they remained in and about Kadesh.)

 At the end of these years of wanderings, the tribes were a second time gathered together at Kadesh. During their stay here at this time Miriam died and was buried. Here the people murmured for want of water, as their forefathers had done formerly at Rephidim; and Moses, irritated by their chidings, “with his rod smote the rock twice,” instead of “speaking to the rock before their eyes,” as the Lord had commanded him (comp. [Num. 27:14](/num#Num.27.14); [Deut. 9:23](/deut#Deut.9.23); [Ps. 106:32](/ps#Ps.106.32), [33](/ps#Ps.106.33)). Because of this act of his, in which Aaron too was involved, neither of them was to be permitted to set foot within the Promised Land ([Num. 20:12](/num#Num.20.12), [24](/num#Num.20.24)).

Then a disgust fell on the multitude at having nothing to eat but the manna day after day, no change, no flesh, no fish, no high-flavoured vegetables, no luscious fruits...The people loathed the ‘light food,’ and cried out to Moses, ‘Give us flesh, give us flesh, that we may eat.’” In this emergency Moses, in despair, cried unto God. An answer came. God sent “a prodigious flight of quails, on which the people satiated their gluttonous appetite for a full month. Then punishment fell on them: they loathed the food which they had desired; it bred disease in them; the divine anger aggravated the disease into a plague, and a heavy mortality was the consequence.

This valley is known in Scripture only by the name “the brook Kidron.” David crossed this brook bare-foot and weeping, when fleeing from Absalom ([2 Sam. 15:23](/2sam#2Sam.15.23), [30](/2sam#2Sam.15.30)), and it was frequently crossed by our Lord in his journeyings to and fro ([John 18:1](/john#John.18.1)). Here Asa burned the obscene idols of his mother ([1 Kings 15:13](/1kgs#1Kgs.15.13)), and here Athaliah was executed ([2 Kings 11:16](/2kgs#2Kgs.11.16)). It afterwards became the receptacle for all manner of impurities ([2 Chr. 29:16](/2chr#2Chr.29.16); [30:14](/2chr#2Chr.30.14)); and in the time of Josiah this valley was the common cemetery of the city ([2 Kings 23:6](/2kgs#2Kgs.23.6); comp. [Jer. 26:23](/jer#Jer.26.23)).

 Through this mountain ravine no water runs, except after heavy rains in the mountains round about Jerusalem. Its length from its head to en-Rogel is 2 3/4 miles. Its precipitous, rocky banks are filled with ancient tombs, especially the left bank opposite the temple area. The greatest desire of the Jews is to be buried there, from the idea that the Kidron is the “valley of Jehoshaphat” mentioned in [Joel 3:2](/joel#Joel.3.2).

 Below en-Rogel the Kidron has no historical or sacred interest. It runs in a winding course through the wilderness of Judea to the north-western shore of the Dead Sea. Its whole length, in a straight line, is only some 20 miles, but in this space its descent is about 3,912 feet.

 Recent excavations have brought to light the fact that the old bed of the Kidron is about 40 feet lower than its present bed, and about 70 feet nearer the sanctuary wall.",0.0,place,kidron_687,,kidron_687

King,3721,k-p58.2,King,"Is in Scripture very generally used to denote one invested with authority, whether extensive or limited. There were thirty-one kings in Canaan ([Josh. 12:9](/josh#Josh.12.9), [24](/josh#Josh.12.24)), whom Joshua subdued. Adonibezek subdued seventy kings ([Judg. 1:7](/judg#Judg.1.7)). In the New Testament the Roman emperor is spoken of as a king ([1 Pet. 2:13](/1pet#1Pet.2.13), [17](/1pet#1Pet.2.17)); and Herod Antipas, who was only a tetrarch, is also called a king ([Matt. 14:9](/matt#Matt.14.9); [Mark 6:22](/mark#Mark.6.22)).

 This title is applied to God ([1 Tim. 1:17](/1tim#1Tim.1.17)), and to Christ, the Son of God ([1 Tim. 6:15](/1tim#1Tim.6.15), [16](/1tim#1Tim.6.16); [Matt. 27:11](/matt#Matt.27.11)). The people of God are also called “kings” ([Dan. 7:22](/dan#Dan.7.22), [27](/dan#Dan.7.27); [Matt. 19:28](/matt#Matt.19.28); [Rev. 1:6](/rev#Rev.1.6), etc.). Death is called the “king of terrors” ([Job 18:14](/job#Job.18.14)).

 Jehovah was the sole King of the Jewish nation ([1 Sam. 8:7](/1sam#1Sam.8.7); [Isa. 33:22](/isa#Isa.33.22)). But there came a time in the history of that people when a king was demanded, that they might be like other nations ([1 Sam. 8:5](/1sam#1Sam.8.5)). The prophet Samuel remonstrated with them, but the people cried out, “Nay, but we will have a king over us.” The misconduct of Samuel’s sons was the immediate cause of this demand.

 The Hebrew kings did not rule in their own right, nor in name of the people who had chosen them, but partly as servants and partly as representatives of Jehovah, the true King of Israel ([1 Sam. 10:1](/1sam#1Sam.10.1)). The limits of the king’s power were prescribed ([1 Sam. 10:25](/1sam#1Sam.10.25)). The officers of his court were, (1) the recorder or remembrancer ([2 Sam. 8:16](/2sam#2Sam.8.16); [1 Kings 4:3](/1kgs#1Kgs.4.3)); (2) the scribe ([2 Sam. 8:17](/2sam#2Sam.8.17); [20:25](/2sam#2Sam.20.25)); (3) the officer over the house, the chief steward ([Isa. 22:15](/isa#Isa.22.15)); (4) the “king’s friend,” a confidential companion ([1 Kings 4:5](/1kgs#1Kgs.4.5)); (5) the keeper of the wardrobe ([2 Kings 22:14](/2kgs#2Kgs.22.14)); (6) captain of the bodyguard ([2 Sam. 20:23](/2sam#2Sam.20.23)); (7) officers over the king’s treasures, etc. ([1 Chr. 27:25-31](/1chr#1Chr.27.25)); (8) commander-in-chief of the army ([1 Chr. 27:34](/1chr#1Chr.27.34)); (9) the royal counsellor ([1 Chr. 27:32](/1chr#1Chr.27.32); [2 Sam. 16:20-23](/2sam#2Sam.16.20)).

Kingly office of Christ,3723,k-p64.14,Kingly office of Christ,"One of the three special relations in which Christ stands to his people. Christ’s office as mediator comprehends three different functions, viz., those of a prophet, priest, and king. These are not three distinct offices, but three functions of the one office of mediator.

 Christ is King and sovereign Head over his Church and over all things to his Church ([Eph. 1:22](/eph#Eph.1.22); [4:15](/eph#Eph.4.15); [Col. 1:18](/col#Col.1.18); [2:19](/col#Col.2.19)). He executes this mediatorial kingship in his Church, and over his Church, and over all things in behalf of his Church. This royalty differs from that which essentially belongs to him as God, for it is given to him by the Father as the reward of his obedience and sufferings ([Phil. 2:6-11](/phil#Phil.2.6)), and has as its especial object the upbuilding and the glory of his redeemed Church. It attaches, moreover, not to his divine nature as such, but to his person as God-man.

 Christ’s mediatorial kingdom may be regarded as comprehending, (1) his kingdom of power, or his providential government of the universe; (2) his kingdom of grace, which is wholly spiritual in its subjects and administration; and (3) his kingdom of glory, which is the consummation of all his providential and gracious administration.

 Christ sustained and exercised the function of mediatorial King as well as of Prophet and Priest, from the time of the fall of man, when he entered on his mediatorial work; yet it may be said that he was publicly and formally enthroned when he ascended up on high and sat down at the Father’s right hand ([Ps. 2:6](/ps#Ps.2.6); [Jer. 23:5](/jer#Jer.23.5); [Isa. 9:6](/isa#Isa.9.6)), after his work of humiliation and suffering on earth was “finished.”",0.0,unmatched,unmatched,,

"Kings, The Books of",3725,k-p69.3,"Kings, The Books of","The two books of Kings formed originally but one book in the Hebrew Scriptures. The present division into two books was first made by the LXX., which now, with the Vulgate, numbers them as the third and fourth books of Kings, the two books of Samuel being the first and second books of Kings.

 They contain the annals of the Jewish commonwealth from the accession of Solomon till the subjugation of the kingdom by Nebuchadnezzar and the Babylonians (apparently a period of about four hundred and fifty-three years). The books of Chronicles (q.v.) are more comprehensive in their contents than those of Kings. The latter synchronize with [1 Chr. 28](/1chr#1Chr.28)-[2 Chr. 36:21](/2chr#2Chr.36.21). While in the Chronicles greater prominence is given to the priestly or Levitical office, in the Kings greater prominence is given to the kingly.

 The authorship of these books is uncertain. There are some portions of them and of Jeremiah that are almost identical, e.g., [2 Kings 24:18-25](/2kgs#2Kgs.24.18) and [Jer. 52](/jer#Jer.52); [39:1-10](/jer#Jer.39.1); [40:7-41:10](/jer#Jer.40.7). There are also many undesigned coincidences between Jeremiah and Kings ([2 Kings 21](/2kgs#2Kgs.21)-23 and [Jer. 7:15](/jer#Jer.7.15); [15:4](/jer#Jer.15.4); [19:3](/jer#Jer.19.3), etc.), and events recorded in Kings of which Jeremiah had personal knowledge. These facts countenance in some degree the tradition that Jeremiah was the author of the books of Kings. But the more probable supposition is that Ezra, after the Captivity, compiled them from documents written perhaps by David, Solomon, Nathan, Gad, and Iddo, and that he arranged them in the order in which they now exist.

 In the threefold division of the Scriptures by the Jews, these books are ranked among the “Prophets.” They are frequently quoted or alluded to by our Lord and his apostles ([Matt. 6:29](/matt#Matt.6.29); [12:42](/matt#Matt.12.42); [Luke 4:25](/luke#Luke.4.25), [26](/luke#Luke.4.26); 10:4; comp.

 The sources of the narrative are referred to (1) “the book of the acts of Solomon” ([1 Kings 11:41](/1kgs#1Kgs.11.41)); (2) the “book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah” (14:29; 15:7, 23, etc.); (3) the “book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel” (14:19; 15:31; 16:14, 20, 27, etc.).

 The date of its composition was some time between B.C. 561, the date of the last chapter ([2 Kings 25](/2kgs#2Kgs.25)), when Jehoiachin was released from captivity by Evil-merodach, and B.C. 538, the date of the decree of deliverance by Cyrus.",0.0,unmatched,unmatched,,

The institution of the Aaronic priesthood and the Levitical service at Sinai was a great religious revolution. The old priesthood of the heads of families passed away. This gave rise to murmurings and discontent, while the Israelites were encamped at Kadesh for the first time, which came to a head in a rebellion against Moses and Aaron, headed by Korah, Dathan, and Abiram. Two hundred and fifty princes, “men of renown” i.e., well-known men from among the other tribes, joined this conspiracy. The whole company demanded of Moses and Aaron that the old state of things should be restored, alleging that “they took too much upon them” ([Num. 16:1-3](/num#Num.16.1)). On the morning after the outbreak, Korah and his associates presented themselves at the door of the tabernacle, and “took every man his censer, and put fire in them, and laid incense thereon.” But immediately “fire from the Lord” burst forth and destroyed them all ([Num. 16:35](/num#Num.16.35)). Dathan and Abiram “came out and stood in the door of their tents, and their wives, and their sons, and their little children,” and it came to pass “that the ground clave asunder that was under them; and the earth opened her mouth and swallowed them up.” A plague thereafter began among the people who sympathized in the rebellion, and was only stayed by Aaron’s appearing between the living and the dead, and making “an atonement for the people” (16:47).

It was taken and destroyed by the Israelites ([Josh. 10:31-33](/josh#Josh.10.31)). It afterwards became, under Rehoboam, one of the strongest fortresses of Judah ([2 Chr. 10:9](/2chr#2Chr.10.9)).

An account of this siege is given on some slabs found in the chambers of the palace of Koyunjik, and now in the British Museum. The inscription has been deciphered as follows:, “Sennacherib, the mighty king, king of the country of Assyria, sitting on the throne of judgment before the city of Lachish: I gave permission for its slaughter.”

 Lachish has been identified with Tell-el-Hesy, where a cuneiform tablet has been found, containing a letter supposed to be from Amenophis at Amarna in reply to one of the Amarna tablets sent by Zimrida from Lachish. This letter is from the chief of Atim (=Etam, [1 Chr. 4:32](/1chr#1Chr.4.32)) to the chief of Lachish, in which the writer expresses great alarm at the approach of marauders from the Hebron hills. “They have entered the land,” he says, “to lay waste...strong is he who has come down. He lays waste.” This letter shows that “the communication by tablets in cuneiform script was not only usual in writing to Egypt, but in the internal correspondence of the country. The letter, though not so important in some ways as the Moabite stone and the Siloam text, is one of the most valuable discoveries ever made in Palestine” (Conder’s Tell Amarna Tablets, p. 134).

 Excavations at Lachish are still going on, and among other discoveries is that of an iron blast-furnace, with slag and ashes, which is supposed to have existed B.C. 1500. If the theories of experts are correct, the use of the hot-air blast instead of cold air (an improvement in iron manufacture patented by Neilson in 1828) was known fifteen hundred years before Christ.",0.0,place,lachish_711,,lachish_711

"Lamentations, Book of",3800,l-p17.7,"Lamentations, Book of","Called in the Hebrew canon ’Ekhah, meaning “How,” being the formula for the commencement of a song of wailing. It is the first word of the book (see [2 Sam. 1:19-27](/2sam#2Sam.1.19)). The LXX. adopted the name rendered “Lamentations” (Gr. threnoi = Heb. qinoth) now in common use, to denote the character of the book, in which the prophet mourns over the desolations brought on the city and the holy land by Chaldeans. In the Hebrew Bible it is placed among the Khethubim.

 As to its authorship, there is no room for hesitancy in following the LXX. and the Targum in ascribing it to Jeremiah. The spirit, tone, language, and subject-matter are in accord with the testimony of tradition in assigning it to him. According to tradition, he retired after the destruction of Jerusalem by Nebuchadnezzar to a cavern outside the Damascus gate, where he wrote this book. That cavern is still pointed out. “In the face of a rocky hill, on the western side of the city, the local belief has placed ‘the grotto of Jeremiah.’ There, in that fixed attitude of grief which Michael Angelo has immortalized, the prophet may well be supposed to have mourned the fall of his country” (Stanley, Jewish Church).

 The book consists of five separate poems. In chapter 1 the prophet dwells on the manifold miseries oppressed by which the city sits as a solitary widow weeping sorely. In chapter 2 these miseries are described in connection with the national sins that had caused them. Chapter 3 speaks of hope for the people of God. The chastisement would only be for their good; a better day would dawn for them. Chapter 4 laments the ruin and desolation that had come upon the city and temple, but traces it only to the people’s sins. Chapter 5 is a prayer that Zion’s reproach may be taken away in the repentance and recovery of the people.

 The first four poems (chapters) are acrostics, like some of the Psalms (25, 34, 37, 119), i.e., each verse begins with a letter of the Hebrew alphabet taken in order.

Lebanon,3842,l-p66.12,Lebanon,"White, “the white mountain of Syria,” is the loftiest and most celebrated mountain range in Syria.

They enclose a long valley ([Josh. 11:17](/josh#Josh.11.17)) of from 5 to 8 miles in width, called by Roman writers Coele-Syria, now called el-Buka’a, “the valley,” a prolongation of the valley of the Jordan.

 Lebanon proper, Jebel es-Sharki, commences at its southern extremity in the gorge of the Leontes, the ancient Litany, and extends north-east, parallel to the Mediterranean coast, as far as the river Eleutherus, at the plain of Emesa, “the entering of Hamath” ([Num. 34:8](/num#Num.34.8); [1 Kings 8:65](/1kgs#1Kgs.8.65)), in all about 90 geographical miles in extent. The average height of this range is from 6,000 to 8,000 feet; the peak of Jebel Mukhmel is about 10,200 feet, and the Sannin about 9,000. The highest peaks are covered with perpetual snow and ice. In the recesses of the range wild beasts as of old still abound ([2 Kings 14:9](/2kgs#2Kgs.14.9); [Cant. 4:8](/song#Song.4.8)). The scenes of the Lebanon are remarkable for their grandeur and beauty, and supplied the sacred writers with many expressive similes ([Ps. 29:5](/ps#Ps.29.5), [6](/ps#Ps.29.6); [72:16](/ps#Ps.72.16); [104:16-18](/ps#Ps.104.16); [Cant. 4:15](/song#Song.4.15); [Isa. 2:13](/isa#Isa.2.13); [35:2](/isa#Isa.35.2); [60:13](/isa#Isa.60.13); [Hos. 14:5](/hos#Hos.14.5)). It is famous for its cedars ([Cant. 5:15](/song#Song.5.15)), its wines ([Hos. 14:7](/hos#Hos.14.7)), and its cool waters ([Jer. 18:14](/jer#Jer.18.14)). The ancient inhabitants were Giblites and Hivites ([Josh. 13:5](/josh#Josh.13.5); [Judg. 3:3](/judg#Judg.3.3)). It was part of the Phoenician kingdom ([1 Kings 5:2-6](/1kgs#1Kgs.5.2)).

 The eastern range, or Anti-Lebanon, or “Lebanon towards the sunrising,” runs nearly parallel with the western from the plain of Emesa till it connects with the hills of Galilee in the south. The height of this range is about 5,000 feet. Its highest peak is Hermon (q.v.), from which a number of lesser ranges radiate.

 Lebanon is first mentioned in the description of the boundary of Palestine ([Deut. 1:7](/deut#Deut.1.7); [11:24](/deut#Deut.11.24)). It was assigned to Israel, but was never conquered ([Josh. 13:2-6](/josh#Josh.13.2); [Judg. 3:1-3](/judg#Judg.3.1)).

Leprosy,3854,l-p82.8,Leprosy,"(Heb. tsara’ath, a “smiting,” a “stroke,” because the disease was regarded as a direct providential infliction). This name is from the Greek lepra, by which the Greek physicians designated the disease from its scaliness. We have the description of the disease, as well as the regulations connected with it, in [Lev. 13](/lev#Lev.13); [14](/lev#Lev.14); [Num. 12:10-15](/num#Num.12.10), etc. There were reckoned six different circumstances under which it might develop itself, (1) without any apparent cause ([Lev. 13:2-8](/lev#Lev.13.2)); (2) its reappearance (9-17); (3) from an inflammation (18-28); (4) on the head or chin (29-37); (5) in white polished spots (38, 39); (6) at the back or in the front of the head (40-44).

 Lepers were required to live outside the camp or city ([Num. 5:1-4](/num#Num.5.1); [12:10-15](/num#Num.12.10), etc.). This disease was regarded as an awful punishment from the Lord ([2 Kings 5:7](/2kgs#2Kgs.5.7); [2 Chr. 26:20](/2chr#2Chr.26.20)).

 This disease “begins with specks on the eyelids and on the palms, gradually spreading over the body, bleaching the hair white wherever they appear, crusting the affected parts with white scales, and causing terrible sores and swellings. From the skin the disease eats inward to the bones, rotting the whole body piecemeal.” “In Christ’s day no leper could live in a walled town, though he might in an open village. But wherever he was he was required to have his outer garment rent as a sign of deep grief, to go bareheaded, and to cover his beard with his mantle, as if in lamentation at his own virtual death. He had further to warn passers-by to keep away from him, by calling out, ‘Unclean! unclean!’ nor could he speak to any one, or receive or return a salutation, since in the East this involves an embrace.”

 That the disease was not contagious is evident from the regulations regarding it ([Lev. 13:12](/lev#Lev.13.12), [13](/lev#Lev.13.13), [36](/lev#Lev.13.36); [2 Kings 5:1](/2kgs#2Kgs.5.1)). Leprosy was “the outward and visible sign of the innermost spiritual corruption; a meet emblem in its small beginnings, its gradual spread, its internal disfigurement, its dissolution little by little of the whole body, of that which corrupts, degrades, and defiles man’s inner nature, and renders him unmeet to enter the presence of a pure and holy God” (Maclear’s Handbook O.T). Our Lord cured lepers ([Matt. 8:2](/matt#Matt.8.2), [3](/matt#Matt.8.3); [Mark 1:40-42](/mark#Mark.1.40)).

Levite,3864,l-p94.5,Levite,"A descendant of the tribe of Levi ([Ex. 6:25](/exod#Exod.6.25); [Lev. 25:32](/lev#Lev.25.32); [Num. 35:2](/num#Num.35.2); [Josh. 21:3](/josh#Josh.21.3), [41](/josh#Josh.21.41)). This name is, however, generally used as the title of that portion of the tribe which was set apart for the subordinate offices of the sanctuary service ([1 Kings 8:4](/1kgs#1Kgs.8.4); [Ezra 2:70](/ezra#Ezra.2.70)), as assistants to the priests.

 When the Israelites left Egypt, the ancient manner of worship was still observed by them, the eldest son of each house inheriting the priest’s office. At Sinai the first change in this ancient practice was made. A hereditary priesthood in the family of Aaron was then instituted ([Ex. 28:1](/exod#Exod.28.1)). But it was not till that terrible scene in connection with the sin of the golden calf that the tribe of Levi stood apart and began to occupy a distinct position ([Ex. 32](/exod#Exod.32)). The religious primogeniture was then conferred on this tribe, which henceforth was devoted to the service of the sanctuary ([Num. 3:11-13](/num#Num.3.11)). They were selected for this purpose because of their zeal for the glory of God ([Ex. 32:26](/exod#Exod.32.26)), and because, as the tribe to which Moses and Aaron belonged, they would naturally stand by the lawgiver in his work.

 The Levitical order consisted of all the descendants of Levi’s three sons, Gershon, Kohath, and Merari; whilst Aaron, Amram’s son (Amram, son of Kohat), and his issue constituted the priestly order.

 The age and qualification for Levitical service are specified in [Num. 4:3](/num#Num.4.3), [23](/num#Num.4.23), [30](/num#Num.4.30), [39](/num#Num.4.39), [43](/num#Num.4.43), [47](/num#Num.4.47).

 They were not included among the armies of Israel ([Num. 1:47](/num#Num.1.47); [2:33](/num#Num.2.33); [26:62](/num#Num.26.62)), but were reckoned by themselves. They were the special guardians of the tabernacle ([Num. 1:51](/num#Num.1.51); [18:22-24](/num#Num.18.22)). The Gershonites pitched their tents on the west of the tabernacle (3:23), the Kohathites on the south (3:29), the Merarites on the north (3:35), and the priests on the east (3:38). It was their duty to move the tent and carry the parts of the sacred structure from place to place. They were given to Aaron and his sons the priests to wait upon them and do work for them at the sanctuary services ([Num. 8:19](/num#Num.8.19); [18:2-6](/num#Num.18.2)).

 As being wholly consecrated to the service of the Lord, they had no territorial possessions. Jehovah was their inheritance ([Num. 18:20](/num#Num.18.20); [26:62](/num#Num.26.62); [Deut. 10:9](/deut#Deut.10.9); [18:1](/deut#Deut.18.1), [2](/deut#Deut.18.2)), and for their support it was ordained that they should receive from the other tribes the tithes of the produce of the land. Forty-eight cities also were assigned to them, thirteen of which were for the priests “to dwell in”, i.e., along with their other inhabitants. Along with their dwellings they had “suburbs”, i.e., “commons”, for their herds and flocks, and also fields and vineyards ([Num. 35:2-5](/num#Num.35.2)). Nine of these cities were in Judah, three in Naphtali, and four in each of the other tribes ([Josh. 21](/josh#Josh.21)). Six of the Levitical cities were set apart as “cities of refuge” (q.v.). Thus the Levites were scattered among the tribes to keep alive among them the knowledge and service of God.",0.0,person,levi_1820,,

They supplied models for the ornaments of the pillars and the molten sea” ([1 Kings 7:19](/1kgs#1Kgs.7.19), [22](/1kgs#1Kgs.7.22), [26](/1kgs#1Kgs.7.26); [2 Chr. 4:5](/2chr#2Chr.4.5)). In the Canticles its beauty and fragrance shadow forth the preciousness of Christ to the Church. Groser, however (Scrip. Nat. Hist.), strongly argues that the word, both in the Old and New Testaments, denotes liliaceous plants in general, or if one genus is to be selected, that it must be the genus Iris, which is “large, vigorous, elegant in form, and gorgeous in colouring.”

 The lilies (Gr. krinia) spoken of in the New Testament ([Matt. 6:28](/matt#Matt.6.28); [Luke 12:27](/luke#Luke.12.27)) were probably the scarlet martagon (Lilium Chalcedonicum) or “red Turk’s-cap lily”, which “comes into flower at the season of the year when our Lord’s sermon on the mount is supposed to have been delivered. It is abundant in the district of Galilee; and its fine scarlet flowers render it a very conspicous and showy object, which would naturally attract the attention of the hearers” (Balfour’s Plants of the Bible).

 Of the true “floral glories of Palestine” the pheasant’s eye (Adonis Palestina), the ranunuculus (R. Asiaticus), and the anemone (A coronaria), the last named is however, with the greatest probability regarded as the “lily of the field” to which our Lord refers. “Certainly,” says Tristram (Nat. Hist. of the Bible), “if, in the wondrous richness of bloom which characterizes the land of Israel in spring, any one plant can claim pre-eminence, it is the anemone, the most natural flower for our Lord to pluck and seize upon as an illustration, whether walking in the fields or sitting on the hill-side.” “The white water-lily (Nymphcea alba) and the yellow water-lily (Nuphar lutea) are both abundant in the marshes of the Upper Jordan, but have no connection with the lily of Scripture.”",0.0,unmatched,unmatched,,

Locust,3917,l-p150.5,Locust,"There are ten Hebrew words used in Scripture to signify locust. In the New Testament locusts are mentioned as forming part of the food of John the Baptist ([Matt. 3:4](/matt#Matt.3.4); [Mark 1:6](/mark#Mark.1.6)). By the Mosaic law they were reckoned “clean,” so that he could lawfully eat them. The name also occurs in [Rev. 9:3](/rev#Rev.9.3), [7](/rev#Rev.9.7), in allusion to this Oriental devastating insect.

 Locusts belong to the class of Orthoptera, i.e., straight-winged. They are of many species. The ordinary Syrian locust resembles the grasshopper, but is larger and more destructive. “The legs and thighs of these insects are so powerful that they can leap to a height of two hundred times the length of their bodies. When so raised they spread their wings and fly so close together as to appear like one compact moving mass.” Locusts are prepared as food in various ways. Sometimes they are pounded, and then mixed with flour and water, and baked into cakes; “sometimes boiled, roasted, or stewed in butter, and then eaten.” They were eaten in a preserved state by the ancient Assyrians.

 The devastations they make in Eastern lands are often very appalling. The invasions of locusts are the heaviest calamites that can befall a country. “Their numbers exceed computation: the hebrews called them ‘the countless,’ and the Arabs knew them as ‘the darkeners of the sun.’ Unable to guide their own flight, though capable of crossing large spaces, they are at the mercy of the wind, which bears them as blind instruments of Providence to the doomed region given over to them for the time. Innumerable as the drops of water or the sands of the seashore, their flight obscures the sun and casts a thick shadow on the earth ([Ex. 10:15](/exod#Exod.10.15); [Judg. 6:5](/judg#Judg.6.5); [7:12](/judg#Judg.7.12); [Jer. 46:23](/jer#Jer.46.23); [Joel 2:10](/joel#Joel.2.10)). It seems indeed as if a great aerial mountain, many miles in breadth, were advancing with a slow, unresting progress. Woe to the countries beneath them if the wind fall and let them alight! They descend unnumbered as flakes of snow and hide the ground. It may be ‘like the garden of Eden before them, but behind them is a desolate wilderness. At their approach the people are in anguish; all faces lose their colour’ ([Joel 2:6](/joel#Joel.2.6)). No walls can stop them; no ditches arrest them; fires kindled in their path are forthwith extinguished by the myriads of their dead, and the countless armies march on ([Joel 2:8](/joel#Joel.2.8), [9](/joel#Joel.2.9)). If a door or a window be open, they enter and destroy everything of wood in the house. Every terrace, court, and inner chamber is filled with them in a moment. Such an awful visitation swept over Egypt ([Ex. 10:1-19](/exod#Exod.10.1)), consuming before it every green thing, and stripping the trees, till the land was bared of all signs of vegetation.

The lot was always resorted to by the Hebrews with strictest reference to the interposition of God, and as a method of ascertaining the divine will ([Prov. 16:33](/prov#Prov.16.33)), and in serious cases of doubt ([Esther 3:7](/esth#Esth.3.7)). Thus the lot was used at the division of the land of Canaan among the serveral tribes ([Num. 26:55](/num#Num.26.55); [34:13](/num#Num.34.13)), at the detection of Achan ([Josh. 7:14](/josh#Josh.7.14), [18](/josh#Josh.7.18)), the election of Saul to be king ([1 Sam. 10:20](/1sam#1Sam.10.20), [21](/1sam#1Sam.10.21)), the distribution of the priestly offices of the temple service ([1 Chr. 24:3](/1chr#1Chr.24.3), [5](/1chr#1Chr.24.5), [19](/1chr#1Chr.24.19); [Luke 1:9](/luke#Luke.1.9)), and over the two goats at the feast of Atonement ([Lev. 16:8](/lev#Lev.16.8)). Matthias, who was “numbered with the eleven” ([Acts 1:24-26](/acts#Acts.1.24)), was chosen by lot.

 Lot, (Heb. lot), a covering; veil, the son of Haran, and nephew of Abraham ([Gen. 11:27](/gen#Gen.11.27)). On the death of his father, he was left in charge of his grandfather Terah (31), after whose death he accompanied his uncle Abraham into Canaan (12:5), thence into Egypt (10), and back again to Canaan (13:1). After this he separated from him and settled in Sodom (13:5-13). There his righteous soul was “vexed” from day to day (2 Pet. 2:7), and he had great cause to regret this act. Not many years after the separation he was taken captive by Chedorlaomer, and was rescued by Abraham ([Gen. 14](/gen#Gen.14)). At length, when the judgment of God descended on the guilty cities of the plain ([Gen. 19:1-20](/gen#Gen.19.1)), Lot was miraculously delivered. When fleeing from the doomed city his wife “looked back from behind him, and became a pillar of salt.” There is to this day a peculiar crag at the south end of the Dead Sea, near Kumran, which the Arabs call Bint Sheik Lot, i.e., Lot’s wife. It is “a tall, isolated needle of rock, which really does bear a curious resemblance to an Arab woman with a child upon her shoulder.” From the words of warning in [Luke 17:32](/luke#Luke.17.32), “Remember Lot’s wife,” it would seem as if she had gone back, or tarried so long behind in the desire to save some of her goods, that she became involved in the destruction which fell on the city, and became a stiffened corpse, fixed for a time in the saline incrustations. She became “a pillar of salt”, i.e., as some think, of asphalt.

 Lot and his daughters sought refuge first in Zoar, and then, fearing to remain there longer, retired to a cave in the neighbouring mountains ([Gen. 19:30](/gen#Gen.19.30)).

When our Lord says, “Lovest thou me?” he uses the Greek word agapas; and when Simon answers, he uses the Greek word philo, i.e., “I love.” This is the usage in the first and second questions put by our Lord; but in the third our Lord uses Simon’s word. The distinction between these two Greek words is thus fitly described by Trench:, ”Agapan has more of judgment and deliberate choice; philein has more of attachment and peculiar personal affection. Thus the ‘Lovest thou’ (Gr. agapas) on the lips of the Lord seems to Peter at this moment too cold a word, as though his Lord were keeping him at a distance, or at least not inviting him to draw near, as in the passionate yearning of his heart he desired now to do. Therefore he puts by the word and substitutes his own stronger ‘I love’ (Gr. philo) in its room. A second time he does the same. And now he has conquered; for when the Lord demands a third time whether he loves him, he does it in the word which alone will satisfy Peter (‘Lovest thou,’ Gr. phileis), which alone claims from him that personal attachment and affection with which indeed he knows that his heart is full.”

Luke,3951,l-p190.3,Luke,"The evangelist, was a Gentile. The date and circumstances of his conversion are unknown. According to his own statement ([Luke 1:2](/luke#Luke.1.2)), he was not an “eye-witness and minister of the word from the beginning.” It is probable that he was a physician in Troas, and was there converted by Paul, to whom he attached himself. He accompanied him to Philippi, but did not there share his imprisonment, nor did he accompany him further after his release in his missionary journey at this time ([Acts 17:1](/acts#Acts.17.1)). On Paul’s third visit to Philippi (20:5, 6) we again meet with Luke, who probably had spent all the intervening time in that city, a period of seven or eight years. From this time Luke was Paul’s constant companion during his journey to Jerusalem (20:6-21:18). He again disappears from view during Paul’s imprisonment at Jerusalem and Caesarea, and only reappears when Paul sets out for Rome (27:1), whither he accompanies him (28:2, 12-16), and where he remains with him till the close of his first imprisonment ([Philemon 1](/phlm#Phlm.1.1):24; [Col. 4:14](/col#Col.4.14)).

"Luke, Gospel according to",3952,l-p192.1,"Luke, Gospel according to","Was written by Luke. He does not claim to have been an eye-witness of our Lord’s ministry, but to have gone to the best sources of information within his reach, and to have written an orderly narrative of the facts ([Luke 1:1-4](/luke#Luke.1.1)). The authors of the first three Gospels, the synoptics, wrote independently of each other. Each wrote his independent narrative under the guidance of the Holy Spirit.

 Each writer has some things, both in matter and style, peculiar to himself, yet all the three have much in common. Luke’s Gospel has been called “the Gospel of the nations, full of mercy and hope, assured to the world by the love of a suffering Saviour;” “the Gospel of the saintly life;” “the Gospel for the Greeks; the Gospel of the future; the Gospel of progressive Christianity, of the universality and gratuitousness of the gospel; the historic Gospel; the Gospel of Jesus as the good Physician and the Saviour of mankind;” the “Gospel of the Fatherhood of God and the brotherhood of man;” “the Gospel of womanhood;” “the Gospel of the outcast, of the Samaritan, the publican, the harlot, and the prodigal;” “the Gospel of tolerance.” The main characteristic of this Gospel, as Farrar (Cambridge Bible, Luke, Introd.) remarks, is fitly expressed in the motto, “Who went about doing good, and healing all that were oppressed of the devil” ([Acts 10:38](/acts#Acts.10.38); comp. [Luke 4:18](/luke#Luke.4.18)). Luke wrote for the “Hellenic world.” This Gospel is indeed “rich and precious.”

 “Out of a total of 1151 verses, Luke has 389 in common with Matthew and Mark, 176 in common with Matthew alone, 41 in common with Mark alone, leaving 544 peculiar to himself. In many instances all three use identical language.” (See  MATTHEW;  MARK; GOSPELS.)

 There are seventeen of our Lord’s parables peculiar to this Gospel. (See List of Parables in Appendix.) Luke also records seven of our Lord’s miracles which are omitted by Matthew and Mark. (See List of Miracles in Appendix.) The synoptical Gospels are related to each other after the following scheme. If the contents of each Gospel be represented by 100, then when compared this result is obtained:

 Mark has 7 peculiarities, 93 coincidences.  [Matthew 42](/matt#Matt.42) peculiarities, 58 coincidences.  [Luke 59](/luke#Luke.59) peculiarities, 41 coincidences.

 That is, thirteen-fourteenths of Mark, four-sevenths of Matthew, and two-fifths of Luke are taken up in describing the same things in very similar language.

 Luke’s style is more finished and classical than that of Matthew and Mark. There is less in it of the Hebrew idiom. He uses a few Latin words ([Luke 12:6](/luke#Luke.12.6); [7:41](/luke#Luke.7.41); [8:30](/luke#Luke.8.30); [11:33](/luke#Luke.11.33); [19:20](/luke#Luke.19.20)), but no Syriac or Hebrew words except sikera, an exciting drink of the nature of wine, but not made of grapes (from Heb. shakar, “he is intoxicated”, [Lev. 10:9](/lev#Lev.10.9)), probably palm wine.

 This Gospel contains twenty-eight distinct references to the Old Testament.

 The date of its composition is uncertain. It must have been written before the Acts, the date of the composition of which is generally fixed at about 63 or 64 A.D. This Gospel was written, therefore, probably about 60 or 63, when Luke may have been at Caesarea in attendance on Paul, who was then a prisoner. Others have conjectured that it was written at Rome during Paul’s imprisonment there. But on this point no positive certainty can be attained.

 It is commonly supposed that Luke wrote under the direction, if not at the dictation of Paul. Many words and phrases are common to both; e.g., compare:

Here also he healed a lame man (8), and thus so impressed the ignorant and superstitious people that they took him for Mercury, because he was the “chief speaker,” and his companion Barnabas for Jupiter, probably in consequence of his stately, venerable appearance; and were proceeding to offer sacrifices to them (13), when Paul earnestly addressed them and turned their attention to the true source of all blessings. But soon after, through the influence of the Jews from Antioch in Pisidia and Iconium, they stoned Paul and left him for dead (14:19). On recovering, Paul left for Derbe; but soon returned again, through Lystra, encouraging the disciples there to steadfastness. He in all likelihood visited this city again on his third missionary tour ([Acts 18:23](/acts#Acts.18.23)). Timothy, who was probably born here ([2 Tim. 3:10](/2tim#2Tim.3.10), [11](/2tim#2Tim.3.11)), was no doubt one of those who were on this occasion witnesses of Paul’s persecution and his courage in Lystra.",0.0,place,lystra_742,,lystra_742

Maccabees,3986,m-p18.2,Maccabees,"This word does not occur in Scripture. It was the name given to the leaders of the national party among the Jews who suffered in the persecution under Antiochus Epiphanes, who succeeded to the Syrian throne B.C. 175. It is supposed to have been derived from the Hebrew word (makkabah) meaning “hammer,” as suggestive of the heroism and power of this Jewish family, who are, however, more properly called Asmoneans or Hasmonaeans, the origin of which is much disputed.

 After the expulsion of Antiochus Epiphanes from Egypt by the Romans, he gave vent to his indignation on the Jews, great numbers of whom he mercilessly put to death in Jerusalem. He oppressed them in every way, and tried to abolish altogether the Jewish worship. Mattathias, an aged priest, then residing at Modin, a city to the west of Jerusalem, became now the courageous leader of the national party; and having fled to the mountains, rallied round him a large band of men prepared to fight and die for their country and for their religion, which was now violently suppressed. In [1 Macc. 2:60](/1macc#1Macc.2.60) is recorded his dying counsels to his sons with reference to the war they were now to carry on. His son Judas, “the Maccabee,” succeeded him (B.C. 166) as the leader in directing the war of independence, which was carried on with great heroism on the part of the Jews, and was terminated in the defeat of the Syrians.",0.0,unmatched,unmatched,,

The first contains a history of the war of independence, commencing (B.C. 175) in a series of patriotic struggles against the tyranny of Antiochus Epiphanes, and terminating B.C. 135. It became part of the Vulgate Version of the Bible, and was thus retained among the Apocrypha.

 The second gives a history of the Maccabees’ struggle from B.C. 176 to B.C. 161. Its object is to encourage and admonish the Jews to be faithful to the religion of their fathers.

 The third does not hold a place in the Apocrypha, but is read in the Greek Church. Its design is to comfort the Alexandrian Jews in their persecution. Its writer was evidently an Alexandrian Jew.

 The fourth was found in the Library of Lyons, but was afterwards burned. The fifth contains a history of the Jews from B.C. 184 to B.C. 86.

Macedonia,3988,m-p24.1,Macedonia,"In New Testament times, was a Roman province lying north of Greece. It was governed by a propraetor with the title of proconsul.

It is one of those Bible localities about the identification of which there can be no doubt. It was on the slope of a hill on the east of Hebron, “before Mamre.” Here were laid the bodies of Abraham and Sarah, Isaac and Rebekah, Jacob and Leah ([Gen. 23:19](/gen#Gen.23.19); [25:9](/gen#Gen.25.9); [49:31](/gen#Gen.49.31); [50:13](/gen#Gen.50.13)). Over the cave an ancient Christian church was erected, probably in the time of Justinian, the Roman emperor. This church has been converted into a Mohammedan mosque. The whole is surrounded by the el-Haram i.e., “the sacred enclosure,” about 200 feet long, 115 broad, and of an average height of about 50. This building, from the immense size of some of its stones, and the manner in which they are fitted together, is supposed by some to have been erected in the days of David or of Solomon, while others ascribe it to the time of Herod. It is looked upon as the most ancient and finest relic of Jewish architecture.

 On the floor of the mosque are erected six large cenotaphs as monuments to the dead who are buried in the cave beneath. Between the cenotaphs of Isaac and Rebekah there is a circular opening in the floor into the cavern below, the cave of Machpelah. Here it may be that the body of Jacob, which was embalmed in Egypt, is still preserved (much older embalmed bodies have recently been found in the cave of Deir el-Bahari in Egypt), though those of the others there buried may have long ago mouldered into dust. The interior of the mosque was visited by the Prince of Wales in 1862 by a special favour of the Mohammedan authorities. An interesting account of this visit is given in Dean Stanley’s Lectures on the Jewish Church. It was also visited in 1866 by the Marquis of Bute, and in 1869 by the late Emperor (Frederick) of Germany, then the Crown Prince of Prussia.

There is a remarkable illustration of this divining by teraphim in [Ezek. 21:19-22](/ezek#Ezek.21.19). We read also of the divining cup of Joseph ([Gen. 44:5](/gen#Gen.44.5)). The magicians of Egypt are frequently referred to in the history of the Exodus. Magic was an inherent part of the ancient Egyptian religion, and entered largely into their daily life.

 All magical arts were distinctly prohibited under penalty of death in the Mosaic law. The Jews were commanded not to learn the “abomination” of the people of the Promised Land ([Lev. 19:31](/lev#Lev.19.31); [Deut. 18:9-14](/deut#Deut.18.9)). The history of Saul’s consulting the witch of Endor ([1 Sam. 28:3-20](/1sam#1Sam.28.3)) gives no warrant for attributing supernatural power to magicians. From the first the witch is here only a bystander. The practice of magic lingered among the people till after the Captivity, when they gradually abandoned it.

 It is not much referred to in the New Testament. The Magi mentioned in [Matt. 2:1-12](/matt#Matt.2.1) were not magicians in the ordinary sense of the word. They belonged to a religious caste, the followers of Zoroaster, the astrologers of the East. Simon, a magician, was found by Philip at Samaria ([Acts 8:9-24](/acts#Acts.8.9)); and Paul and Barnabas encountered Elymas, a Jewish sorcerer, at Paphos (13:6-12).

In the time of Ezra (9:2) and Nehemiah (2:16; 4:14; 13:11) the Jewish magistrates were called seganim, properly meaning “nobles.” In the New Testament the Greek word archon, rendered “magistrate” ([Luke 12:58](/luke#Luke.12.58); [Titus 3:1](/titus#Titus.3.1)), means one first in power, and hence a prince, as in [Matt. 20:25](/matt#Matt.20.25), [1](/matt#Matt.20.1) Cor. 2:6, 8.

This name was afterwards given to the town which was built at that place. It was the southern boundary of Bashan ([Josh. 13:26](/josh#Josh.13.26), [30](/josh#Josh.13.30)), and became a city of the Levites (21:38). Here Saul’s son Ishbosheth reigned ([2 Sam. 2:8](/2sam#2Sam.2.8), [12](/2sam#2Sam.2.12)), while David reigned at Hebron. Here also, after a troubled reign, Ishbosheth was murdered by two of his own bodyguard ([2 Sam. 4:5-7](/2sam#2Sam.4.5)), who brought his head to David at Hebron, but were, instead of being rewarded, put to death by him for their cold-blooded murder. Many years after this, when he fled from Jerusalem on the rebellion of his son Absalom, David made Mahanaim, where Barzillai entertained him, his headquarters, and here he mustered his forces which were led against the army that had gathered around Absalom. It was while sitting at the gate of this town that tidings of the great and decisive battle between the two hosts and of the death of his son Absalom reached him, when he gave way to the most violent grief ([2 Sam. 17:24-27](/2sam#2Sam.17.24)).

 Man was created by the immediate hand of God, and is generically different from all other creatures ([Gen. 1:26](/gen#Gen.1.26), [27](/gen#Gen.1.27); 2:7). His complex nature is composed of two elements, two distinct substances, viz., body and soul ([Gen. 2:7](/gen#Gen.2.7); [Eccl. 12:7](/eccl#Eccl.12.7); [2 Cor. 5:1-8](/2cor#2Cor.5.1)).

 The words translated “spirit” and “soul,” in [1 Thess. 5:23](/1thess#1Thess.5.23), [Heb. 4:12](/heb#Heb.4.12), are habitually used interchangeably ([Matt. 10:28](/matt#Matt.10.28); [16:26](/matt#Matt.16.26); [1 Pet. 1:22](/1pet#1Pet.1.22)). The “spirit” (Gr. pneuma) is the soul as rational; the “soul” (Gr. psuche) is the same, considered as the animating and vital principle of the body.

 Man was created in the likeness of God as to the perfection of his nature, in knowledge ([Col. 3:10](/col#Col.3.10)), righteousness, and holiness ([Eph. 4:24](/eph#Eph.4.24)), and as having dominion over all the inferior creatures ([Gen. 1:28](/gen#Gen.1.28)). He had in his original state God’s law written on his heart, and had power to obey it, and yet was capable of disobeying, being left to the freedom of his own will.

 The tribe of Manasseh was associated with that of Ephraim and Benjamin during the wanderings in the wilderness. They encamped on the west side of the tabernacle. According to the census taken at Sinai, this tribe then numbered 32,200 ([Num. 1:10](/num#Num.1.10), [35](/num#Num.1.35); 2:20, 21). Forty years afterwards its numbers had increased to 52,700 (26:34, 37), and it was at this time the most distinguished of all the tribes.

 The half of this tribe, along with Reuben and Gad, had their territory assigned them by Moses on the east of the Jordan ([Josh. 13:7-14](/josh#Josh.13.7)); but it was left for Joshua to define the limits of each tribe. This territory on the east of Jordan was more valuable and of larger extent than all that was allotted to the nine and a half tribes in the land of Palestine. It is sometimes called “the land of Gilead,” and is also spoken of as “on the other side of Jordan.” The portion given to the half tribe of Manasseh was the largest on the east of Jordan. It embraced the whole of Bashan. It was bounded on the south by Mahanaim, and extended north to the foot of Lebanon. Argob, with its sixty cities, that “ocean of basaltic rocks and boulders tossed about in the wildest confusion,” lay in the midst of this territory.

 The whole “land of Gilead” having been conquered, the two and a half tribes left their wives and families in the fortified cities there, and accompanied the other tribes across the Jordan, and took part with them in the wars of conquest. The allotment of the land having been completed, Joshua dismissed the two and a half tribes, commending them for their heroic service ([Josh. 22:1-34](/josh#Josh.22.1)). Thus dismissed, they returned over Jordan to their own inheritance.

 On the west of Jordan the other half of the tribe of Manasseh was associated with Ephraim, and they had their portion in the very centre of Palestine, an area of about 1,300 square miles, the most valuable part of the whole country, abounding in springs of water. Manasseh’s portion was immediately to the north of that of Ephraim ([Josh. 16](/josh#Josh.16)).

He early fell under the influence of the heathen court circle, and his reign was characterized by a sad relapse into idolatry with all its vices, showing that the reformation under his father had been to a large extent only superficial ([Isa. 7:10](/isa#Isa.7.10); [2 Kings 21:10-15](/2kgs#2Kgs.21.10)). A systematic and persistent attempt was made, and all too successfully, to banish the worship of Jehovah out of the land. Amid this wide-spread idolatry there were not wanting, however, faithful prophets (Isaiah, Micah) who lifted up their voice in reproof and in warning. But their fidelity only aroused bitter hatred, and a period of cruel persecution against all the friends of the old religion began. “The days of Alva in Holland, of Charles IX. in France, or of the Covenanters under Charles II. in Scotland, were anticipated in the Jewish capital. The streets were red with blood.” There is an old Jewish tradition that Isaiah was put to death at this time ([2 Kings 21:16](/2kgs#2Kgs.21.16); [24:3](/2kgs#2Kgs.24.3), [4](/2kgs#2Kgs.24.4); [Jer. 2:30](/jer#Jer.2.30)), having been sawn asunder in the trunk of a tree. [Psalms 49, 73, 77, 140](/ps#Ps.49 Ps.73 Ps.77 Ps.140), and 141 seem to express the feelings of the pious amid the fiery trials of this great persecution. Manasseh has been called the “Nero of Palestine.”

 Esarhaddon, Sennacherib’s successor on the Assyrian throne, who had his residence in Babylon for thirteen years (the only Assyrian monarch who ever reigned in Babylon), took Manasseh prisoner (B.C. 681) to Babylon. Such captive kings were usually treated with great cruelty. They were brought before the conqueror with a hook or ring passed through their lips or their jaws, having a cord attached to it, by which they were led. This is referred to in [2 Chr. 33:11](/2chr#2Chr.33.11), where the Authorized Version reads that Esarhaddon “took Manasseh among the thorns;” while the Revised Version renders the words, “took Manasseh in chains;” or literally, as in the margin, “with hooks.” (Comp. [2 Kings 19:28](/2kgs#2Kgs.19.28).)

 The severity of Manasseh’s imprisonment brought him to repentance. God heard his cry, and he was restored to his kingdom ([2 Chr. 33:11-13](/2chr#2Chr.33.11)). He abandoned his idolatrous ways, and enjoined the people to worship Jehovah; but there was no thorough reformation. After a lengthened reign extending through fifty-five years, the longest in the history of Judah, he died, and was buried in the garden of Uzza, the “garden of his own house” ([2 Kings 21:17](/2kgs#2Kgs.21.17), [18](/2kgs#2Kgs.21.18); [2 Chr. 33:20](/2chr#2Chr.33.20)), and not in the city of David, among his ancestors. He was succeeded by his son Amon.

 In [Judg. 18:30](/judg#Judg.18.30) the correct reading is “Moses,” and not “Manasseh.” The name “Manasseh” is supposed to have been introduced by some transcriber to avoid the scandal of naming the grandson of Moses the great lawgiver as the founder of an idolatrous religion.",2.0,multi,"['manasseh_1930', 'manasseh_1929']",,

Manna,4068,m-p111.6,Manna,"Heb. man-hu, “What is that?” the name given by the Israelites to the food miraculously supplied to them during their wanderings in the wilderness ([Ex. 16:15-35](/exod#Exod.16.15)). The name is commonly taken as derived from man, an expression of surprise, “What is it?” but more probably it is derived from manan, meaning “to allot,” and hence denoting an “allotment” or a “gift.” This “gift” from God is described as “a small round thing,” like the “hoar-frost on the ground,” and “like coriander seed,” “of the colour of bdellium,” and in taste “like wafers made with honey.” It was capable of being baked and boiled, ground in mills, or beaten in a mortar ([Ex. 16:23](/exod#Exod.16.23); [Num. 11:7](/num#Num.11.7)). If any was kept over till the following morning, it became corrupt with worms; but as on the Sabbath none fell, on the preceding day a double portion was given, and that could be kept over to supply the wants of the Sabbath without becoming corrupt. Directions concerning the gathering of it are fully given ([Ex. 16:16-18](/exod#Exod.16.16), [33](/exod#Exod.16.33); [Deut. 8:3](/deut#Deut.8.3), [16](/deut#Deut.8.16)). It fell for the first time after the eighth encampment in the desert of Sin, and was daily furnished, except on the Sabbath, for all the years of the wanderings, till they encamped at Gilgal, after crossing the Jordan, when it suddenly ceased, and where they “did eat of the old corn of the land; neither had the children of Israel manna any more” ([Josh. 5:12](/josh#Josh.5.12)). They now no longer needed the “bread of the wilderness.”

 This manna was evidently altogether a miraculous gift, wholly different from any natural product with which we are acquainted, and which bears this name. The manna of European commerce comes chiefly from Calabria and Sicily. It drops from the twigs of a species of ash during the months of June and July. At night it is fluid and resembles dew, but in the morning it begins to harden. The manna of the Sinaitic peninsula is an exudation from the “manna-tamarisk” tree (Tamarix mannifera), the el-tarfah of the Arabs. This tree is found at the present day in certain well-watered valleys in the peninsula of Sinai. The manna with which the people of Israel were fed for forty years differs in many particulars from all these natural products.

 Our Lord refers to the manna when he calls himself the “true bread from heaven” ([John 6:31-35](/john#John.6.31); 48-51). He is also the “hidden manna” ([Rev. 2:17](/rev#Rev.2.17); comp. [John 6:49](/john#John.6.49), [51](/john#John.6.51)).",0.0,unmatched,unmatched,,

 He was the son of Mary, a woman apparently of some means and influence, and was probably born in Jerusalem, where his mother resided ([Acts 12:12](/acts#Acts.12.12)). Of his father we know nothing. He was cousin of Barnabas ([Col. 4:10](/col#Col.4.10)). It was in his mother’s house that Peter found “many gathered together praying” when he was released from prison; and it is probable that it was here that he was converted by Peter, who calls him his “son” ([1 Pet. 5:13](/1pet#1Pet.5.13)). It is probable that the “young man” spoken of in [Mark 14:51](/mark#Mark.14.51), [52](/mark#Mark.14.52) was Mark himself. He is first mentioned in [Acts 12:25](/acts#Acts.12.25).

At a later period he was with Peter in Babylon ([1 Pet. 5:13](/1pet#1Pet.5.13)), then, and for some centuries afterwards, one of the chief seats of Jewish learning; and he was with Timothy in Ephesus when Paul wrote him during his second imprisonment ([2 Tim. 4:11](/2tim#2Tim.4.11)).

"Mark, Gospel according to",4093,m-p135.3,"Mark, Gospel according to","It is the current and apparently well-founded tradition that Mark derived his information mainly from the discourses of Peter. In his mother’s house he would have abundant opportunities of obtaining information from the other apostles and their coadjutors, yet he was “the disciple and interpreter of Peter” specially.

 As to the time when it was written, the Gospel furnishes us with no definite information. Mark makes no mention of the destruction of Jerusalem, hence it must have been written before that event, and probably about A.D. 63.

 The place where it was written was probably Rome. Some have supposed Antioch (comp. [Mark 15:21](/mark#Mark.15.21) with [Acts 11:20](/acts#Acts.11.20)).

 It was intended primarily for Romans. This appears probable when it is considered that it makes no reference to the Jewish law, and that the writer takes care to interpret words which a Gentile would be likely to misunderstand, such as, “Boanerges” (3:17); “Talitha cumi” (5:41); “Corban” (7:11); “Bartimaeus” (10:46); “Abba” (14:36); “Eloi,” etc. (15:34). Jewish usages are also explained (7:3; 14:3; 14:12; 15:42). Mark also uses certain Latin words not found in any of the other Gospels, as “speculator” (6:27, rendered, A.V., “executioner;” R.V., “soldier of his guard”), “xestes” (a corruption of sextarius, rendered “pots,” 7:4, 8), “quadrans” (12:42, rendered “a farthing”), “centurion” (15:39, 44, 45).

 “The Gospel of Mark,” says Westcott, “is essentially a transcript from life.

His Gospel is a rapid succession of vivid pictures loosely strung together without much attempt to bind them into a whole or give the events in their natural sequence. This pictorial power is that which specially characterizes this evangelist, so that ‘if any one desires to know an evangelical fact, not only in its main features and grand results, but also in its most minute and so to speak more graphic delineation, he must betake himself to Mark.’” The leading principle running through this Gospel may be expressed in the motto: “Jesus came...preaching the gospel of the kingdom” ([Mark 1:14](/mark#Mark.1.14)).

Marriage,4098,m-p143.2,Marriage,"Was instituted in Paradise when man was in innocence ([Gen. 2:18-24](/gen#Gen.2.18)). Here we have its original charter, which was confirmed by our Lord, as the basis on which all regulations are to be framed ([Matt. 19:4](/matt#Matt.19.4), [5](/matt#Matt.19.5)). It is evident that monogamy was the original law of marriage ([Matt. 19:5](/matt#Matt.19.5); [1 Cor. 6:16](/1cor#1Cor.6.16)). This law was violated in after times, when corrupt usages began to be introduced ([Gen. 4:19](/gen#Gen.4.19); [6:2](/gen#Gen.6.2)). We meet with the prevalence of polygamy and concubinage in the patriarchal age ([Gen. 16:1-4](/gen#Gen.16.1); [22:21-24](/gen#Gen.22.21); [28:8](/gen#Gen.28.8), [9](/gen#Gen.28.9); [29:23-30](/gen#Gen.29.23), etc.). Polygamy was acknowledged in the Mosaic law and made the basis of legislation, and continued to be practised all down through the period of Jewish histroy to the Captivity, after which there is no instance of it on record.

 It seems to have been the practice from the beginning for fathers to select wives for their sons ([Gen. 24:3](/gen#Gen.24.3); [38:6](/gen#Gen.38.6)). Sometimes also proposals were initiated by the father of the maiden ([Ex. 2:21](/exod#Exod.2.21)). The brothers of the maiden were also sometimes consulted ([Gen. 24:51](/gen#Gen.24.51); [34:11](/gen#Gen.34.11)), but her own consent was not required. The young man was bound to give a price to the father of the maiden (31:15; 34:12; [Ex. 22:16](/exod#Exod.22.16), [17](/exod#Exod.22.17); [1 Sam. 18:23](/1sam#1Sam.18.23), [25](/1sam#1Sam.18.25); [Ruth 4:10](/ruth#Ruth.4.10); [Hos. 3:2](/hos#Hos.3.2)) On these patriarchal customs the Mosaic law made no change.

 In the pre-Mosaic times, when the proposals were accepted and the marriage price given, the bridegroom could come at once and take away his bride to his own house ([Gen. 24:63-67](/gen#Gen.24.63)). But in general the marriage was celebrated by a feast in the house of the bride’s parents, to which all friends were invited (29:22, 27); and on the day of the marriage the bride, concealed under a thick veil, was conducted to her future husband’s home.

 Our Lord corrected many false notions then existing on the subject of marriage ([Matt. 22:23-30](/matt#Matt.22.23)), and placed it as a divine institution on the highest grounds. The apostles state clearly and enforce the nuptial duties of husband and wife ([Eph. 5:22-33](/eph#Eph.5.22); [Col. 3:18](/col#Col.3.18), [19](/col#Col.3.19); [1 Pet. 3:1-7](/1pet#1Pet.3.1)). Marriage is said to be “honourable” ([Heb. 13:4](/heb#Heb.13.4)), and the prohibition of it is noted as one of the marks of degenerate times ([1 Tim. 4:3](/1tim#1Tim.4.3)).

 The marriage relation is used to represent the union between God and his people ([Isa. 54:5](/isa#Isa.54.5); [Jer. 3:1-14](/jer#Jer.3.1); [Hos. 2:9](/hos#Hos.2.9), [20](/hos#Hos.2.20)). In the New Testament the same figure is employed in representing the love of Christ to his saints ([Eph. 5:25-27](/eph#Eph.5.25)). The Church of the redeemed is the “Bride, the Lamb’s wife” ([Rev. 19:7-9](/rev#Rev.19.7)).",0.0,unmatched,unmatched,,

The guests sit round the great bowl or bowls on the floor, the meal usually consisting of a lamb or kid stewed in rice or barley. The most honoured guests sit nearest, others behind; and all in eating dip their hand into the one smoking mound, pieces of the thin bread, bent together, serving for spoons when necessary. After the first circle have satisfied themselves, those lower in honour sit down to the rest, the whole company being men, for women are never seen at a feast. Water is poured on the hands before eating; and this is repeated when the meal closes, the fingers having first been wiped on pieces of bread, which, after serving the same purpose as table-napkins with us, are thrown on the ground to be eaten by any dog that may have stolen in from the streets through the ever-open door, or picked up by those outside when gathered and tossed out to them ([Matt. 15:27](/matt#Matt.15.27); [Mark 7:28](/mark#Mark.7.28)). Rising from the ground and retiring to the seats round the walls, the guests then sit down cross-legged and gossip, or listen to recitals, or puzzle over riddles, light being scantily supplied by a small lamp or two, or if the night be chilly, by a smouldering fire of weeds kindled in the middle of the room, perhaps in a brazier, often in a hole in the floor.

From the residence being called “her house,” some have supposed that she was a widow, and that her brother and sister lodged with her. She seems to have been of an anxious, bustling spirit, anxious to be helpful in providing the best things for the Master’s use, in contrast to the quiet earnestness of Mary, who was more concerned to avail herself of the opportunity of sitting at his feet and learning of him. Afterwards at a supper given to Christ and his disciples in her house “Martha served.” Nothing further is known of her.

 “Mary and Martha are representatives of two orders of human character. One was absorbed, preoccupied, abstracted; the other was concentrated and single-hearted. Her own world was the all of Martha; Christ was the first thought with Mary. To Martha life was ‘a succession of particular businesses;’ to Mary life ’was rather the flow of one spirit.’ Martha was Petrine, Mary was Johannine. The one was a well-meaning, bustling busybody; the other was a reverent disciple, a wistful listener.” Paul had such a picture as that of Martha in his mind when he spoke of serving the Lord “without distraction” ([1 Cor. 7:35](/1cor#1Cor.7.35)).",0.0,person,martha_1937,martha_1937,

Mary 1,4106,m-p153.17,Mary,"The wife of Joseph, the mother of Jesus, called the “Virgin Mary,” though never so designated in Scripture ([Matt. 2:11](/matt#Matt.2.11); [Acts 1:14](/acts#Acts.1.14)). Little is known of her personal history. Her genealogy is given in [Luke 3](/luke#Luke.3). She was of the tribe of Judah and the lineage of David ([Ps. 132:11](/ps#Ps.132.11); [Luke 1:32](/luke#Luke.1.32)). She was connected by marriage with Elisabeth, who was of the lineage of Aaron ([Luke 1:36](/luke#Luke.1.36)).

 While she resided at Nazareth with her parents, before she became the wife of Joseph, the angel Gabriel announced to her that she was to be the mother of the promised Messiah ([Luke 1:35](/luke#Luke.1.35)). After this she went to visit her cousin Elisabeth, who was living with her husband Zacharias (probably at Juttah, [Josh. 15:55](/josh#Josh.15.55); [21:16](/josh#Josh.21.16), in the neighbourhood of Maon), at a considerable distance, about 100 miles, from Nazareth. Immediately on entering the house she was saluted by Elisabeth as the mother of her Lord, and then forthwith gave utterance to her hymn of thanksgiving ([Luke 1:46-56](/luke#Luke.1.46); comp. [1 Sam. 2:1-10](/1sam#1Sam.2.1)). After three months Mary returned to Nazareth to her own home. Joseph was supernaturally made aware ([Matt. 1:18-25](/matt#Matt.1.18)) of her condition, and took her to his own home. Soon after this the decree of Augustus ([Luke 2:1](/luke#Luke.2.1)) required that they should proceed to Bethlehem ([Micah 5:2](/mic#Mic.5.2)), some 80 or 90 miles from Nazareth; and while they were there they found shelter in the inn or khan provided for strangers ([Luke 2:6](/luke#Luke.2.6), [7](/luke#Luke.2.7)). But as the inn was crowded, Mary had to retire to a place among the cattle, and there she brought forth her son, who was called Jesus ([Matt. 1:21](/matt#Matt.1.21)), because he was to save his people from their sins. This was followed by the presentation in the temple, the flight into Egypt, and their return in the following year and residence at Nazareth ([Matt. 2](/matt#Matt.2)). There for thirty years Mary, the wife of Joseph the carpenter, resides, filling her own humble sphere, and pondering over the strange things that had happened to her. During these years only one event in the history of Jesus is recorded, viz., his going up to Jerusalem when twelve years of age, and his being found among the doctors in the temple ([Luke 2:41-52](/luke#Luke.2.41)). Probably also during this period Joseph died, for he is not again mentioned.

 After the commencement of our Lord’s public ministry little notice is taken of Mary. She was present at the marriage in Cana. A year and a half after this we find her at Capernaum ([Matt. 12:46](/matt#Matt.12.46), [48](/matt#Matt.12.48), [49](/matt#Matt.12.49)), where Christ uttered the memorable words, “Who is my mother? and who are my brethren? And he stretched forth his hand toward his disciples, and said, Behold my mother and my brethren!” The next time we find her is at the cross along with her sister Mary, and Mary Magdalene, and Salome, and other women ([John 19:26](/john#John.19.26)). From that hour John took her to his own abode. She was with the little company in the upper room after the Ascension ([Acts 1:14](/acts#Acts.1.14)).

She is for the first time noticed in [Luke 8:3](/luke#Luke.8.3) as one of the women who “ministered to Christ of their substance.” Their motive was that of gratitude for deliverances he had wrought for them. Out of Mary were cast seven demons. Gratitude to her great Deliverer prompted her to become his follower. These women accompanied him also on his last journey to Jerusalem ([Matt. 27:55](/matt#Matt.27.55); [Mark 15:41](/mark#Mark.15.41); [Luke 23:55](/luke#Luke.23.55)). They stood near the cross. There Mary remained till all was over, and the body was taken down and laid in Joseph’s tomb. Again, in the earliest dawn of the first day of the week she, with Salome and Mary the mother of James ([Matt. 28:1](/matt#Matt.28.1); [Mark 16:2](/mark#Mark.16.2)), came to the sepulchre, bringing with them sweet spices, that they might anoint the body of Jesus. They found the sepulchre empty, but saw the “vision of angels” ([Matt. 28:5](/matt#Matt.28.5)). She hastens to tell Peter and John, who were probably living together at this time ([John 20:1](/john#John.20.1), [2](/john#John.20.2)), and again immediately returns to the sepulchre. There she lingers thoughtfully, weeping at the door of the tomb. The risen Lord appears to her, but at first she knows him not. His utterance of her name “Mary” recalls her to consciousness, and she utters the joyful, reverent cry, “Rabboni.” She would fain cling to him, but he forbids her, saying, “Touch me not; for I am not yet ascended to my Father.” This is the last record regarding Mary of Magdala, who now returned to Jerusalem.

On the occasion of our Lord’s last visit to Bethany, Mary brought “a pound of ointment of spikenard, very costly, and anointed the feet of Jesus” as he reclined at table in the house of one Simon, who had been a leper ([Matt. 26:6](/matt#Matt.26.6); [Mark 14:3](/mark#Mark.14.3); [John 12:2](/john#John.12.2), [3](/john#John.12.3)). This was an evidence of her overflowing love to the Lord. Nothing is known of her subsequent history.

"Matthew, Gospel according to",4136,m-p181.6,"Matthew, Gospel according to","The author of this book was beyond a doubt the Matthew, an apostle of our Lord, whose name it bears. He wrote the Gospel of Christ according to his own plans and aims, and from his own point of view, as did also the other “evangelists.”

 As to the time of its composition, there is little in the Gospel itself to indicate. It was evidently written before the destruction of Jerusalem ([Matt. 24](/matt#Matt.24)), and some time after the events it records. The probability is that it was written between the years A.D. 60 and 65.

 The cast of thought and the forms of expression employed by the writer show that this Gospel was written for Jewish Christians of Palestine. His great object is to prove that Jesus of Nazareth was the promised Messiah, and that in him the ancient prophecies had their fulfilment. The Gospel is full of allusions to those passages of the Old Testament in which Christ is predicted and foreshadowed. The one aim prevading the whole book is to show that Jesus is he “of whom Moses in the law and the prophets did write.” This Gospel contains no fewer than sixty-five references to the Old Testament, forty-three of these being direct verbal citations, thus greatly outnumbering those found in the other Gospels. The main feature of this Gospel may be expressed in the motto, “I am not come to destroy, but to fulfil.”

 As to the language in which this Gospel was written there is much controversy. Many hold, in accordance with old tradition, that it was originally written in Hebrew (i.e., the Aramaic or Syro-Chaldee dialect, then the vernacular of the inhabitants of Palestine), and afterwards translated into Greek, either by Matthew himself or by some person unknown. This theory, though earnestly maintained by able critics, we cannot see any ground for adopting. From the first this Gospel in Greek was received as of authority in the Church. There is nothing in it to show that it is a translation. Though Matthew wrote mainly for the Jews, yet they were everywhere familiar with the Greek language. The same reasons which would have suggested the necessity of a translation into Greek would have led the evangelist to write in Greek at first. It is confessed that this Gospel has never been found in any other form than that in which we now possess it.

 The leading characteristic of this Gospel is that it sets forth the kingly glory of Christ, and shows him to be the true heir to David’s throne. It is the Gospel of the kingdom. Matthew uses the expression “kingdom of heaven” (thirty-two times), while Luke uses the expression “kingdom of God” (thirty-three times). Some Latinized forms occur in this Gospel, as kodrantes ([Matt. 5:26](/matt#Matt.5.26)), for the Latin quadrans, and phragello (27:26), for the Latin flagello. It must be remembered that Matthew was a tax-gatherer for the Roman government, and hence in contact with those using the Latin language.

 As to the relation of the Gospels to each other, we must maintain that each writer of the synoptics (the first three) wrote independently of the other two, Matthew being probably first in point of time.

 “Out of a total of 1071 verses, Matthew has 387 in common with Mark and Luke, 130 with Mark, 184 with Luke; only 387 being peculiar to itself.”

 We first hear of this people in the Assyrian cuneiform records, under the name of Amada, about B.C. 840. They appear to have been a branch of the Aryans, who came from the east bank of the Indus, and were probably the predominant race for a while in the Mesopotamian valley. They consisted for three or four centuries of a number of tribes, each ruled by its own chief, who at length were brought under the Assyrian yoke ([2 Kings 17:6](/2kgs#2Kgs.17.6)). From this subjection they achieved deliverance, and formed themselves into an empire under Cyaxares (B.C. 633). This monarch entered into an alliance with the king of Babylon, and invaded Assyria, capturing and destroying the city of Nineveh (B.C. 625), thus putting an end to the Assyrian monarchy ([Nah. 1:8](/nah#Nah.1.8); [2:5](/nah#Nah.2.5), [6](/nah#Nah.2.6); [3:13](/nah#Nah.3.13), [14](/nah#Nah.3.14)).

 Media now rose to a place of great power, vastly extending its boundaries. But it did not long exist as an independent kingdom. It rose with Cyaxares, its first king, and it passed away with him; for during the reign of his son and successor Astyages, the Persians waged war against the Medes and conquered them, the two nations being united under one monarch, Cyrus the Persian (B.C. 558).

 The “cities of the Medes” are first mentioned in connection with the deportation of the Israelites on the destruction of Samaria ([2 Kings 17:6](/2kgs#2Kgs.17.6); [18:11](/2kgs#2Kgs.18.11)). Soon afterwards Isaiah (13:17; 21:2) speaks of the part taken by the Medes in the destruction of Babylon (comp. [Jer. 51:11](/jer#Jer.51.11), [28](/jer#Jer.51.28)). Daniel gives an account of the reign of Darius the Mede, who was made viceroy by Cyrus ([Dan. 6:1-28](/dan#Dan.6.1)). The decree of Cyrus, Ezra informs us (6:2-5), was found in “the palace that is in the province of the Medes,” Achmetha or Ecbatana of the Greeks, which is the only Median city mentioned in Scripture.",0.0,place,media_776,,media_776
Mediator,4169,m-p220.6,Mediator,"One who intervenes between two persons who are at variance, with a view to reconcile them. This word is not found in the Old Testament; but the idea it expresses is found in [Job 9:33](/job#Job.9.33), in the word “daysman” (q.v.), marg., “umpire.”

 This word is used in the New Testament to denote simply an internuncius, an ambassador, one who acts as a medium of communication between two contracting parties. In this sense Moses is called a mediator in [Gal. 3:19](/gal#Gal.3.19).

 Christ is the one and only mediator between God and man ([1 Tim. 2:5](/1tim#1Tim.2.5); [Heb. 8:6](/heb#Heb.8.6); [9:15](/heb#Heb.9.15); [12:24](/heb#Heb.12.24)). He makes reconciliation between God and man by his all-perfect atoning sacrifice. Such a mediator must be at once divine and human, divine, that his obedience and his sufferings might possess infinite worth, and that he might possess infinite wisdom and knowlege and power to direct all things in the kingdoms of providence and grace which are committed to his hands ([Matt. 28:18](/matt#Matt.28.18); [John 5:22](/john#John.5.22), [25](/john#John.5.25), [26](/john#John.5.26), [27](/john#John.5.27)); and human, that in his work he might represent man, and be capable of rendering obedience to the law and satisfying the claims of justice ([Heb. 2:17](/heb#Heb.2.17), [18](/heb#Heb.2.18); 4:15, 16), and that in his glorified humanity he might be the head of a glorified Church ([Rom. 8:29](/rom#Rom.8.29)).

 This office involves the three functions of prophet, priest, and king, all of which are discharged by Christ both in his estate of humiliation and exaltation. These functions are so inherent in the one office that the quality appertaining to each gives character to every mediatorial act. They are never separated in the exercise of the office of mediator.",0.0,unmatched,unmatched,,

Megiddo,4171,m-p225.16,Megiddo,"Place of troops, originally one of the royal cities of the Canaanites ([Josh. 12:21](/josh#Josh.12.21)), belonged to the tribe of Manasseh ([Judg. 1:27](/judg#Judg.1.27)), but does not seem to have been fully occupied by the Israelites till the time of Solomon ([1 Kings 4:12](/1kgs#1Kgs.4.12); [9:15](/1kgs#1Kgs.9.15)).

 The valley or plain of Megiddo was part of the plain of Esdraelon, the great battle-field of Palestine. It was here Barak gained a notable victory over Jabin, the king of Hazor, whose general, Sisera, led on the hostile army. Barak rallied the warriors of the northern tribes, and under the encouragement of Deborah (q.v.), the prophetess, attacked the Canaanites in the great plain. The army of Sisera was thrown into complete confusion, and was engulfed in the waters of the Kishon, which had risen and overflowed its banks ([Judg. 4:5](/judg#Judg.4.5)).

 Many years after this (B.C. 610), Pharaohnecho II., on his march against the king of Assyria, passed through the plains of Philistia and Sharon; and King Josiah, attempting to bar his progress in the plain of Megiddo, was defeated by the Egyptians. He was wounded in battle, and died as they bore him away in his chariot towards Jerusalem ([2 Kings 23:29](/2kgs#2Kgs.23.29); [2 Chr. 35:22-24](/2chr#2Chr.35.22)), and all Israel mourned for him. So general and bitter was this mourning that it became a proverb, to which Zechariah (12:11, 12) alludes. Megiddo has been identified with the modern el-Lejjun, at the head of the Kishon, under the north-eastern brow of Carmel, on the south-western edge of the plain of Esdraelon, and 9 miles west of Jezreel.

He is subsequently mentioned only once in the Old Testament, in [Ps. 110:4](/ps#Ps.110.4). The typical significance of his history is set forth in detail in the Epistle to the Hebrews, ch. 7. The apostle there points out the superiority of his priesthood to that of Aaron in these several respects, (1) Even Abraham paid him tithes; (2) he blessed Abraham; (3) he is the type of a Priest who lives for ever; (4) Levi, yet unborn, paid him tithes in the person of Abraham; (5) the permanence of his priesthood in Christ implied the abrogation of the Levitical system; (6) he was made priest not without an oath; and (7) his priesthood can neither be transmitted nor interrupted by death: “this man, because he continueth ever, hath an unchangeable priesthood.”

 The question as to who this mysterious personage was has given rise to a great deal of modern speculation. It is an old tradition among the Jews that he was Shem, the son of Noah, who may have survived to this time. Melchizedek was a Canaanitish prince, a worshipper of the true God, and in his peculiar history and character an instructive type of our Lord, the great High Priest ([Heb. 5:6](/heb#Heb.5.6), [7](/heb#Heb.5.7); 6:20).

After a stay of three months on this island, during which the “barbarians” showed them no little kindness, Julius procured for himself and his company a passage in another Alexandrian corn-ship which had wintered in the island, in which they proceeded on their voyage to Rome ([Acts 28:13](/acts#Acts.28.13), [14](/acts#Acts.28.14)).",0.0,place,melita_761,,melita_761

It is said to have been founded by Menes, the first king of Egypt, and to have been in circumference about 19 miles. “There are few remains above ground,” says Manning (The Land of the Pharaohs), “of the splendour of ancient Memphis. The city has utterly disappeared. If any traces yet exist, they are buried beneath the vast mounds of crumbling bricks and broken pottery which meet the eye in every direction.

Messiah,4247,m-p301.5,Messiah,"(Heb. mashiah), in all the thirty-nine instances of its occurring in the Old Testament, is rendered by the LXX. “Christos.” It means anointed. Thus priests ([Ex. 28:41](/exod#Exod.28.41); [40:15](/exod#Exod.40.15); [Num. 3:3](/num#Num.3.3)), prophets ([1 Kings 19:16](/1kgs#1Kgs.19.16)), and kings ([1 Sam. 9:16](/1sam#1Sam.9.16); [16:3](/1sam#1Sam.16.3); [2 Sam. 12:7](/2sam#2Sam.12.7)) were anointed with oil, and so consecrated to their respective offices. The great Messiah is anointed “above his fellows” ([Ps. 45:7](/ps#Ps.45.7)); i.e., he embraces in himself all the three offices. The Greek form “Messias” is only twice used in the New Testament, in [John 1:41](/john#John.1.41) and 4:25 (R.V., “Messiah”), and in the Old Testament the word Messiah, as the rendering of the Hebrew, occurs only twice ([Dan 9:25](/dan#Dan.9.25), [26](/dan#Dan.9.26); R.V., “the anointed one”).

 The first great promise ([Gen. 3:15](/gen#Gen.3.15)) contains in it the germ of all the prophecies recorded in the Old Testament regarding the coming of the Messiah and the great work he was to accomplish on earth. The prophecies became more definite and fuller as the ages rolled on; the light shone more and more unto the perfect day. Different periods of prophetic revelation have been pointed out, (1) the patriarchal; (2) the Mosaic; (3) the period of David; (4) the period of prophetism, i.e., of those prophets whose works form a part of the Old Testament canon. The expectations of the Jews were thus kept alive from generation to generation, till the “fulness of the times,” when Messiah came, “made of a woman, made under the law, to redeem them that were under the law.” In him all these ancient prophecies have their fulfilment. Jesus of Nazareth is the Messiah, the great Deliverer who was to come. (Comp.

"Micah, Book of",4266,m-p318.5,"Micah, Book of","The sixth in order of the so-called minor prophets. The superscription to this book states that the prophet exercised his office in the reigns of Jotham, Ahaz, and Hezekiah. If we reckon from the beginning of Jotham’s reign to the end of Hezekiah’s (B.C. 759-698), then he ministered for about fifty-nine years; but if we reckon from the death of Jotham to the accession of Hezekiah (B.C. 743-726), his ministry lasted only sixteen years. It has been noticed as remarkable that this book commences with the last words of another prophet, “Micaiah the son of Imlah” ([1 Kings 22:28](/1kgs#1Kgs.22.28)): “Hearken, O people, every one of you.”

 The book consists of three sections, each commencing with a rebuke, “Hear ye,” etc., and closing with a promise, (1) ch. 1; 2; (2) ch. 3-5, especially addressed to the princes and heads of the people; (3) ch. 6-7, in which Jehovah is represented as holding a controversy with his people: the whole concluding with a song of triumph at the great deliverance which the Lord will achieve for his people. The closing verse is quoted in the song of Zacharias ([Luke 1:72](/luke#Luke.1.72), [73](/luke#Luke.1.73)). The prediction regarding the place “where Christ should be born,” one of the most remarkable Messianic prophecies ([Micah 5:2](/mic#Mic.5.2)), is quoted in [Matt. 2:6](/matt#Matt.2.6).

Jehoshaphat agreed, but suggested that inquiry should be first made “at the word of Jehovah.” Ahab’s prophets approved of the expedition; but Jehoshaphat, still dissatisfied, asked if there was no other prophet besides the four hundred that had appeared, and was informed of this Micaiah. He was sent for from prison, where he had been confined, probably on account of some prediction disagreeable to Ahab; and he condemned the expedition, and prophesied that it would end, as it did, in disaster.

They early engaged in commercial pursuits. It was to one of their caravans that Joseph was sold ([Gen. 37:28](/gen#Gen.37.28), [36](/gen#Gen.37.36)). The next notice of them is in connection with Moses’ flight from Egypt ([Ex. 2:15-21](/exod#Exod.2.15)). Here in Midian Moses became the servant and afterwards the son-in-law of Reuel or Jethro, the priest. After the Exodus, the Midianites were friendly to the Israelites so long as they traversed only their outlying pasture-ground on the west of the Arabah; but when, having passed the southern end of Edom, they entered into the land of Midian proper, they joined with Balak, the king of Moab, in a conspiracy against them ([Num. 22:4-7](/num#Num.22.4)). Balaam, who had been sent for to curse Israel, having utterly failed to do so, was dismissed by the king of Moab; nevertheless he still tarried among the Midianites, and induced them to enter into correspondence with the Israelites, so as to bring them into association with them in the licentious orgies connected with the worship of Baal-Peor. This crafty counsel prevailed. The Israelites took part in the heathen festival, and so brought upon themselves a curse indeed. Their apostasy brought upon them a severe punishment. A plague broke out amongst them, and more than twenty-four thousand of the people perished ([Num. 25:9](/num#Num.25.9)). But the Midianites were not to be left unpunished. A terrible vengeance was denounced against them. A thousand warriors from each tribe, under the leadership of Phinehas, went forth against them. The Midianites were utterly routed. Their cities were consumed by fire, five of their kings were put to death, and the whole nation was destroyed ([Josh. 13:21](/josh#Josh.13.21), [22](/josh#Josh.13.22)). Balaam also perished by the sword, receiving the “wages of his unrighteousness” ([Num. 31:8](/num#Num.31.8); 2 Pet. 2:15). The whole of the country on the east of Jordan, now conquered by the Israelites (see SIHON;  OG), was divided between the two tribes of Reuben and Gad and the half tribe of Manasseh.

 Some two hundred and fifty years after this the Midianites had regained their ancient power, and in confederation with the Amalekites and the “children of the east” they made war against their old enemies the Israelites, whom for seven years they oppressed and held in subjection. They were at length assailed by Gideon in that ever-memorable battle in the great plain of Esdraelon, and utterly destroyed ([Judg. 6:1](/judg#Judg.6.1)-ch. 7). Frequent allusions are afterwards made to this great victory ([Ps. 83:10](/ps#Ps.83.10), [12](/ps#Ps.83.12); [Isa. 9:4](/isa#Isa.9.4); [10:6](/isa#Isa.10.6)).

Miracle,4332,m-p382.4,Miracle,"An event in the external world brought about by the immediate agency or the simple volition of God, operating without the use of means capable of being discerned by the senses, and designed to authenticate the divine commission of a religious teacher and the truth of his message ([John 2:18](/john#John.2.18); [Matt. 12:38](/matt#Matt.12.38)). It is an occurrence at once above nature and above man. It shows the intervention of a power that is not limited by the laws either of matter or of mind, a power interrupting the fixed laws which govern their movements, a supernatural power.

 “The suspension or violation of the laws of nature involved in miracles is nothing more than is constantly taking place around us. One force counteracts another: vital force keeps the chemical laws of matter in abeyance; and muscular force can control the action of physical force. When a man raises a weight from the ground, the law of gravity is neither suspended nor violated, but counteracted by a stronger force. The same is true as to the walking of Christ on the water and the swimming of iron at the command of the prophet. The simple and grand truth that the universe is not under the exclusive control of physical forces, but that everywhere and always there is above, separate from and superior to all else, an infinite personal will, not superseding, but directing and controlling all physical causes, acting with or without them.” God ordinarily effects his purpose through the agency of second causes; but he has the power also of effecting his purpose immediately and without the intervention of second causes, i.e., of invading the fixed order, and thus of working miracles. Thus we affirm the possibility of miracles, the possibility of a higher hand intervening to control or reverse nature’s ordinary movements.

 Miracles are seals of a divine mission. The sacred writers appealed to them as proofs that they were messengers of God. Our Lord also appealed to miracles as a conclusive proof of his divine mission ([John 5:20](/john#John.5.20), [36](/john#John.5.36); 10:25, 38). Thus, being out of the common course of nature and beyond the power of man, they are fitted to convey the impression of the presence and power of God. Where miracles are there certainly God is. The man, therefore, who works a miracle affords thereby clear proof that he comes with the authority of God; they are his credentials that he is God’s messenger. The teacher points to these credentials, and they are a proof that he speaks with the authority of God. He boldly says, “God bears me witness, both with signs and wonders, and with divers miracles.”

 The credibility of miracles is established by the evidence of the senses on the part of those who are witnesses of them, and to all others by the testimony of such witnesses. The witnesses were competent, and their testimony is trustworthy. Unbelievers, following Hume, deny that any testimony can prove a miracle, because they say miracles are impossible. We have shown that miracles are possible, and surely they can be borne witness to. Surely they are credible when we have abundant and trustworthy evidence of their occurrence. They are credible just as any facts of history well authenticated are credible. Miracles, it is said, are contrary to experience. Of course they are contrary to our experience, but that does not prove that they were contrary to the experience of those who witnessed them. We believe a thousand facts, both of history and of science, that are contrary to our experience, but we believe them on the ground of competent testimony. An atheist or a pantheist must, as a matter of course, deny the possibility of miracles; but to one who believes in a personal God, who in his wisdom may see fit to interfere with the ordinary processes of nature, miracles are not impossible, nor are they incredible.",4.0,unmatched,unmatched,,

Moabite,4375,m-p425.7,Moabite,"The designation of a tribe descended from Moab, the son of Lot ([Gen. 19:37](/gen#Gen.19.37)). From Zoar, the cradle of this tribe, on the south-eastern border of the Dead Sea, they gradually spread over the region on the east of Jordan. Rameses II., the Pharaoh of the Oppression, enumerates Moab (Muab) among his conquests. Shortly before the Exodus, the warlike Amorites crossed the Jordan under Sihon their king and drove the Moabites ([Num. 21:26-30](/num#Num.21.26)) out of the region between the Arnon and the Jabbok, and occupied it, making Heshbon their capital. They were then confined to the territory to the south of the Arnon.

 On their journey the Israelites did not pass through Moab, but through the “wilderness” to the east ([Deut. 2:8](/deut#Deut.2.8); [Judg. 11:18](/judg#Judg.11.18)), at length reaching the country to the north of the Arnon. Here they remained for some time till they had conquered Bashan (see SIHON;  OG). The Moabites were alarmed, and their king, Balak, sought aid from the Midianites ([Num. 22:2-4](/num#Num.22.2)). It was while they were here that the visit of Balaam (q.v.) to Balak took place.

 After the Conquest, the Moabites maintained hostile relations with the Israelites, and frequently harassed them in war ([Judg. 3:12-30](/judg#Judg.3.12); [1 Sam. 14](/1sam#1Sam.14)). The story of Ruth, however, shows the existence of friendly relations between Moab and Bethlehem. By his descent from Ruth, David may be said to have had Moabite blood in his veins. Yet there was war between David and the Moabites ([2 Sam. 8:2](/2sam#2Sam.8.2); [23:20](/2sam#2Sam.23.20); [1 Chr. 18:2](/1chr#1Chr.18.2)), from whom he took great spoil ([2 Sam. 8:2](/2sam#2Sam.8.2), [11](/2sam#2Sam.8.11), [12](/2sam#2Sam.8.12); [1 Chr. 11:22](/1chr#1Chr.11.22); [18:11](/1chr#1Chr.18.11)).

 During the one hundred and fifty years which followed the defeat of the Moabites, after the death of Ahab (see  MESHA), they regained, apparently, much of their former prosperty. At this time Isaiah (15:1) delivered his “burden of Moab,” predicting the coming of judgment on that land (comp. [2 Kings 17:3](/2kgs#2Kgs.17.3); [18:9](/2kgs#2Kgs.18.9); [1 Chr. 5:25](/1chr#1Chr.5.25), [26](/1chr#1Chr.5.26)). Between the time of Isaiah and the commencement of the Babylonian captivity we have very seldom any reference to Moab ([Jer. 25:21](/jer#Jer.25.21); [27:3](/jer#Jer.27.3); [40:11](/jer#Jer.40.11); [Zeph. 2:8-10](/zeph#Zeph.2.8)).

 After the Return, it was Sanballat, a Moabite, who took chief part in seeking to prevent the rebuilding of Jerusalem ([Neh. 2:19](/neh#Neh.2.19); [4:1](/neh#Neh.4.1); [6:1](/neh#Neh.6.1)).",0.0,multi,"['moab_815', 'moab_2103']",,
Moabite Stone,4376,m-p430.4,Moabite Stone,"A basalt stone, bearing an inscription by King Mesha, which was discovered at Dibon by Klein, a German missionary at Jerusalem, in 1868. It was 3 1/2 feet high and 2 in breadth and in thickness, rounded at the top. It consisted of thirty-four lines, written in Hebrew-Phoenician characters. It was set up by Mesha as a record and memorial of his victories. It records (1) Mesha’s wars with Omri, (2) his public buildings, and (3) his wars against Horonaim. This inscription in a remarkable degree supplements and corroborates the history of King Mesha recorded in [2 Kings 3:4-27](/2kgs#2Kgs.3.4).

 With the exception of a very few variations, the Moabite language in which the inscription is written is identical with the Hebrew. The form of the letters here used supplies very important and interesting information regarding the history of the formation of the alphabet, as well as, incidentally, regarding the arts of civilized life of those times in the land of Moab.

 This ancient monument, recording the heroic struggles of King Mesha with Omri and Ahab, was erected about B.C. 900. Here “we have the identical slab on which the workmen of the old world carved the history of their own times, and from which the eye of their contemporaries read thousands of years ago the record of events of which they themselves had been the witnesses.” It is the oldest inscription written in alphabetic characters, and hence is, apart from its value in the domain of Hebrew antiquities, of great linguistic importance.",0.0,unmatched,unmatched,,

 The Heb. holed ([Lev. 11:29](/lev#Lev.11.29)), rendered “weasel,” was probably the mole-rat. The true mole (Talpa Europoea) is not found in Palestine. The mole-rat (Spalax typhlus) “is twice the size of our mole, with no external eyes, and with only faint traces within of the rudimentary organ; no apparent ears, but, like the mole, with great internal organs of hearing; a strong, bare snout, and with large gnawing teeth; its colour a pale slate; its feet short, and provided with strong nails; its tail only rudimentary.”

 In [Isa. 2:20](/isa#Isa.2.20), this word is the rendering of two words _haphar peroth_, which are rendered by Gesenius “into the digging of rats”, i.e., rats’ holes. But these two Hebrew words ought probably to be combined into one (lahporperoth) and translated “to the moles”, i.e., the rat-moles.

Next, this word is used in connection with the purchase of the cave of Machpelah (23:16), and again in connection with Jacob’s purchase of a field at Shalem ([Gen. 33:18](/gen#Gen.33.18), [19](/gen#Gen.33.19)) for “an hundred pieces of money”=an hundred Hebrew kesitahs (q.v.), i.e., probably pieces of money, as is supposed, bearing the figure of a lamb.

 The history of Joseph affords evidence of the constant use of money, silver of a fixed weight. This appears also in all the subsequent history of the Jewish people, in all their internal as well as foreign transactions. There were in common use in trade silver pieces of a definite weight, shekels, half-shekels, and quarter-shekels. But these were not properly coins, which are pieces of metal authoritatively issued, and bearing a stamp.

 Of the use of coined money we have no early notice among the Hebrews. The first mentioned is of Persian coinage, the daric ([Ezra 2:69](/ezra#Ezra.2.69); [Neh. 7:70](/neh#Neh.7.70)) and the ‘adarkon ([Ezra 8:27](/ezra#Ezra.8.27)). The daric (q.v.) was a gold piece current in Palestine in the time of Cyrus. As long as the Jews, after the Exile, lived under Persian rule, they used Persian coins. These gave place to Greek coins when Palestine came under the dominion of the Greeks (B.C. 331), the coins consisting of gold, silver, and copper pieces. The usual gold pieces were staters (q.v.), and the silver coins tetradrachms and drachms.

There was a class of men, who frequented the temple courts, who exchanged at a certain premium foreign moneys for these half-shekels to the Jews who came up to Jerusalem from all parts of the world.

Month,4382,m-p443.6,Month,"Among the Egyptians the month of thirty days each was in use long before the time of the Exodus, and formed the basis of their calculations. From the time of the institution of the Mosaic law the month among the Jews was lunar. The cycle of religious feasts depended on the moon. The commencement of a month was determined by the observation of the new moon. The number of months in the year was usually twelve ([1 Kings 4:7](/1kgs#1Kgs.4.7); [1 Chr. 27:1-15](/1chr#1Chr.27.1)); but every third year an additional month (ve-Adar) was inserted, so as to make the months coincide with the seasons.

 “The Hebrews and Phoenicians had no word for month save ’moon,’ and only saved their calendar from becoming vague like that of the Moslems by the interpolation of an additional month.

It is frequently referred to along with the sun ([Josh. 10:12](/josh#Josh.10.12); [Ps. 72:5](/ps#Ps.72.5), [7](/ps#Ps.72.7), [17](/ps#Ps.72.17); 89:36, 37; [Eccl. 12:2](/eccl#Eccl.12.2); [Isa. 24:23](/isa#Isa.24.23), etc.), and also by itself ([Ps. 8:3](/ps#Ps.8.3); [121:6](/ps#Ps.121.6)).

 The great brilliance of the moon in Eastern countries led to its being early an object of idolatrous worship ([Deut. 4:19](/deut#Deut.4.19); [17:3](/deut#Deut.17.3); [Job 31:26](/job#Job.31.26)), a form of idolatry against which the Jews were warned ([Deut. 4:19](/deut#Deut.4.19); [17:3](/deut#Deut.17.3)). They, however, fell into this idolatry, and offered incense ([2 Kings 23:5](/2kgs#2Kgs.23.5); [Jer. 8:2](/jer#Jer.8.2)), and also cakes of honey, to the moon ([Jer. 7:18](/jer#Jer.7.18); [44:17-19](/jer#Jer.44.17), [25](/jer#Jer.44.25)).",0.0,unmatched,unmatched,,
Mordecai,4384,m-p447.11,Mordecai,"The son of Jair, of the tribe of Benjamin. It has been alleged that he was carried into captivity with Jeconiah, and hence that he must have been at least one hundred and twenty-nine years old in the twelfth year of Ahasuerus (Xerxes). But the words of Esther do not necessarily lead to this conclusion. It was probably Kish of whom it is said (ver. 6) that he “had been carried away with the captivity.”

 He resided at Susa, the metropolis of Persia. He adopted his cousin Hadassah (Esther), an orphan child, whom he tenderly brought up as his own daughter. When she was brought into the king’s harem and made queen in the room of the deposed queen Vashti, he was promoted to some office in the court of Ahasuerus, and was one of those who “sat in the king’s gate” ([Esther 2:21](/esth#Esth.2.21)). While holding this office, he discovered a plot of the eunuchs to put the king to death, which, by his vigilance, was defeated. His services to the king in this matter were duly recorded in the royal chronicles.

 Haman (q.v.) the Agagite had been raised to the highest position at court. Mordecai refused to bow down before him; and Haman, being stung to the quick by the conduct of Mordecai, resolved to accomplish his death in a wholesale destruction of the Jewish exiles throughout the Persian empire ([Esther 3:8-15](/esth#Esth.3.8)). Tidings of this cruel scheme soon reached the ears of Mordecai, who communicated with Queen Esther regarding it, and by her wise and bold intervention the scheme was frustrated. The Jews were delivered from destruction, Mordecai was raised to a high rank, and Haman was executed on the gallows he had by anticipation erected for Mordecai (6:2-7:10). In memory of the signal deliverance thus wrought for them, the Jews to this day celebrate the feast (9:26-32) of Purim (q.v.).",0.0,person,mordecai_2107,mordecai_2107,

Moses,4393,m-p458.3,Moses,"Drawn (or Egypt. mesu, “son;” hence Rameses, royal son). On the invitation of Pharaoh ([Gen. 45:17-25](/gen#Gen.45.17)), Jacob and his sons went down into Egypt. This immigration took place probably about 350 years before the birth of Moses. Some centuries before Joseph, Egypt had been conquered by a pastoral Semitic race from Asia, the Hyksos, who brought into cruel subjection the native Egyptians, who were an African race. Jacob and his retinue were accustomed to a shepherd’s life, and on their arrival in Egypt were received with favour by the king, who assigned them the “best of the land”, the land of Goshen, to dwell in. The Hyksos or “shepherd” king who thus showed favour to Joseph and his family was in all probability the Pharaoh Apopi (or Apopis).

 Thus favoured, the Israelites began to “multiply exceedingly” ([Gen. 47:27](/gen#Gen.47.27)), and extended to the west and south. At length the supremacy of the Hyksos came to an end. The descendants of Jacob were allowed to retain their possession of Goshen undisturbed, but after the death of Joseph their position was not so favourable. The Egyptians began to despise them, and the period of their “affliction” ([Gen. 15:13](/gen#Gen.15.13)) commenced. They were sorely oppressed. They continued, however, to increase in numbers, and “the land was filled with them” ([Ex. 1:7](/exod#Exod.1.7)). The native Egyptians regarded them with suspicion, so that they felt all the hardship of a struggle for existence.

 In process of time “a king [probably Seti I.] arose who knew not Joseph” ([Ex. 1:8](/exod#Exod.1.8)). The circumstances of the country were such that this king thought it necessary to weaken his Israelite subjects by oppressing them, and by degrees reducing their number. They were accordingly made public slaves, and were employed in connection with his numerous buildings, especially in the erection of store-cities, temples, and palaces. The children of Israel were made to serve with rigour. Their lives were made bitter with hard bondage, and “all their service, wherein they made them serve, was with rigour” ([Ex. 1:13](/exod#Exod.1.13), [14](/exod#Exod.1.14)). But this cruel oppression had not the result expected of reducing their number. On the contrary, “the more the Egyptians afflicted them, the more they multiplied and grew” ([Ex. 1:12](/exod#Exod.1.12)).

 The king next tried, through a compact secretly made with the guild of midwives, to bring about the destruction of all the Hebrew male children that might be born. But the king’s wish was not rigorously enforced; the male children were spared by the midwives, so that “the people multiplied” more than ever. Thus baffled, the king issued a public proclamation calling on the people to put to death all the Hebrew male children by casting them into the river ([Ex. 1:22](/exod#Exod.1.22)). But neither by this edict was the king’s purpose effected.

 One of the Hebrew households into which this cruel edict of the king brought great alarm was that of Amram, of the family of the Kohathites ([Ex. 6:16-20](/exod#Exod.6.16)), who with his wife Jochebed and two children, Miriam, a girl of perhaps fifteen years of age, and Aaron, a boy of three years, resided in or near Memphis, the capital city of that time. In this quiet home a male child was born (B.C. 1571). His mother concealed him in the house for three months from the knowledge of the civic authorities. But when the task of concealment became difficult, Jochebed contrived to bring her child under the notice of the daughter of the king by constructing for him an ark of bulrushes, which she laid among the flags which grew on the edge of the river at the spot where the princess was wont to come down and bathe. Her plan was successful. The king’s daughter “saw the child; and behold the child wept.” The princess (see  PHARAOH’S DAUGHTER [1]) sent Miriam, who was standing by, to fetch a nurse. She went and brought the mother of the child, to whom the princess said, “Take this child away, and nurse it for me, and I will give thee thy wages.” Thus Jochebed’s child, whom the princess called “Moses”, i.e., “Saved from the water” ([Ex. 2:10](/exod#Exod.2.10)), was ultimately restored to her.

 As soon as the natural time for weaning the child had come, he was transferred from the humble abode of his father to the royal palace, where he was brought up as the adopted son of the princess, his mother probably accompanying him and caring still for him. He grew up amid all the grandeur and excitement of the Egyptian court, maintaining, however, probably a constant fellowship with his mother, which was of the highest importance as to his religious belief and his interest in his “brethren.” His education would doubtless be carefully attended to, and he would enjoy all the advantages of training both as to his body and his mind. He at length became “learned in all the wisdom of the Egyptians” ([Acts 7:22](/acts#Acts.7.22)). Egypt had then two chief seats of learning, or universities, at one of which, probably that of Heliopolis, his education was completed. Moses, being now about twenty years of age, spent over twenty more before he came into prominence in Bible history. These twenty years were probably spent in military service. There is a tradition recorded by Josephus that he took a lead in the war which was then waged between Egypt and Ethiopia, in which he gained renown as a skilful general, and became “mighty in deeds” ([Acts 7:22](/acts#Acts.7.22)).

 After the termination of the war in Ethiopia, Moses returned to the Egyptian court, where he might reasonably have expected to be loaded with honours and enriched with wealth. But “beneath the smooth current of his life hitherto, a life of alternate luxury at the court and comparative hardness in the camp and in the discharge of his military duties, there had lurked from childhood to youth, and from youth to manhood, a secret discontent, perhaps a secret ambition. Moses, amid all his Egyptian surroundings, had never forgotten, had never wished to forget, that he was a Hebrew.” He now resolved to make himself acquainted with the condition of his countrymen, and “went out unto his brethren, and looked upon their burdens” ([Ex. 2:11](/exod#Exod.2.11)). This tour of inspection revealed to him the cruel oppression and bondage under which they everywhere groaned, and could not fail to press on him the serious consideration of his duty regarding them. The time had arrived for his making common cause with them, that he might thereby help to break their yoke of bondage. He made his choice accordingly ([Heb. 11:25-27](/heb#Heb.11.25)), assured that God would bless his resolution for the welfare of his people. He now left the palace of the king and took up his abode, probably in his father’s house, as one of the Hebrew people who had for forty years been suffering cruel wrong at the hands of the Egyptians.

 He could not remain indifferent to the state of things around him, and going out one day among the people, his indignation was roused against an Egyptian who was maltreating a Hebrew. He rashly lifted up his hand and slew the Egyptian, and hid his body in the sand. Next day he went out again and found two Hebrews striving together. He speedily found that the deed of the previous day was known. It reached the ears of Pharaoh (the “great Rameses,” Rameses II.), who “sought to slay Moses” ([Ex. 2:15](/exod#Exod.2.15)). Moved by fear, Moses fled from Egypt, and betook himself to the land of Midian, the southern part of the peninsula of Sinai, probably by much the same route as that by which, forty years afterwards, he led the Israelites to Sinai. He was providentially led to find a new home with the family of Reuel, where he remained for forty years ([Acts 7:30](/acts#Acts.7.30)), under training unconsciously for his great life’s work.

 Suddenly the angel of the Lord appeared to him in the burning bush ([Ex. 3](/exod#Exod.3)), and commissioned him to go down to Egypt and “bring forth the children of Israel” out of bondage. He was at first unwilling to go, but at length he was obedient to the heavenly vision, and left the land of Midian (4:18-26). On the way he was met by Aaron (q.v.) and the elders of Israel (27-31). He and Aaron had a hard task before them; but the Lord was with them (ch. 7-12), and the ransomed host went forth in triumph. After an eventful journey to and fro in the wilderness, we see them at length encamped in the plains of Moab, ready to cross over the Jordan into the Promised Land. There Moses addressed the assembled elders ([Deut. 1:1-4](/deut#Deut.1.1); [5:1-26:19](/deut#Deut.5.1); [27:11-30:20](/deut#Deut.27.11)), and gives the people his last counsels, and then rehearses the great song ([Deut. 32](/deut#Deut.32)), clothing in fitting words the deep emotions of his heart at such a time, and in review of such a marvellous history as that in which he had acted so conspicious a part. Then, after blessing the tribes (33), he ascends to “the mountain of Nebo (q.v.), to the top of Pisgah, that is over against Jericho” (34:1), and from thence he surveys the land. “Jehovah shewed him all the land of Gilead, unto Dan, and all Naphtali, and the land of Ephraim, and Manasseh, and all the land of Judah, unto the utmost sea, and the south, and the plain of the valley of Jericho, the city of palm trees, unto Zoar” ([Deut. 34:2-3](/deut#Deut.34.2)), the magnificient inheritance of the tribes of whom he had been so long the leader; and there he died, being one hundred and twenty years old, according to the word of the Lord, and was buried by the Lord “in a valley in the land of Moab, over against Beth-peor” (34:6). The people mourned for him during thirty days.

 Thus died “Moses the man of God” ([Deut. 33:1](/deut#Deut.33.1); [Josh. 14:6](/josh#Josh.14.6)). He was distinguished for his meekness and patience and firmness, and “he endured as seeing him who is invisible.” “There arose not a prophet since in Israel like unto Moses, whom the Lord knew face to face, in all the signs and the wonders, which the Lord sent him to do in the land of Egypt to Pharaoh, and to all his servants, and to all his land, and in all that mighty hand, and in all the great terror which Moses shewed in the sight of all Israel” ([Deut. 34:10-12](/deut#Deut.34.10)).

 The name of Moses occurs frequently in the Psalms and Prophets as the chief of the prophets.

 In the New Testament he is referred to as the representative of the law and as a type of Christ ([John 1:17](/john#John.1.17); [2 Cor. 3:13-18](/2cor#2Cor.3.13); [Heb. 3:5](/heb#Heb.3.5), [6](/heb#Heb.3.6)). Moses is the only character in the Old Testament to whom Christ likens himself ([John 5:46](/john#John.5.46); comp.

In [Heb. 3:1-19](/heb#Heb.3.1) this likeness to Moses is set forth in various particulars.

 Mourning was expressed, (1) by weeping ([Gen. 35:8](/gen#Gen.35.8), marg.; [Luke 7:38](/luke#Luke.7.38), etc.); (2) by loud lamentation ([Ruth 1:9](/ruth#Ruth.1.9); [1 Sam. 6:19](/1sam#1Sam.6.19); [2 Sam. 3:31](/2sam#2Sam.3.31)); (3) by the disfigurement of the person, as rending the clothes ([Gen. 37:29](/gen#Gen.37.29), [34](/gen#Gen.37.34); [Matt. 26:65](/matt#Matt.26.65)), wearing sackcloth ([Gen. 37:34](/gen#Gen.37.34); [Ps. 35:13](/ps#Ps.35.13)), sprinkling dust or ashes on the person ([2 Sam. 13:19](/2sam#2Sam.13.19); [Jer. 6:26](/jer#Jer.6.26); [Job 2:12](/job#Job.2.12)), shaving the head and plucking out the hair of the head or beard ([Lev. 10:6](/lev#Lev.10.6); [Job 1:20](/job#Job.1.20)), neglect of the person or the removal of ornaments ([Ex. 33:4](/exod#Exod.33.4); [Deut. 21:12](/deut#Deut.21.12), [13](/deut#Deut.21.13); [2 Sam. 14:2](/2sam#2Sam.14.2); [19:24](/2sam#2Sam.19.24); [Matt. 6:16](/matt#Matt.6.16), [17](/matt#Matt.6.17)), fasting ([2 Sam. 1:12](/2sam#2Sam.1.12)), covering the upper lip ([Lev. 13:45](/lev#Lev.13.45); [Micah 3:7](/mic#Mic.3.7)), cutting the flesh ([Jer. 16:6](/jer#Jer.16.6), [7](/jer#Jer.16.7)), and sitting in silence ([Judg. 20:26](/judg#Judg.20.26); [2 Sam. 12:16](/2sam#2Sam.12.16); [13:31](/2sam#2Sam.13.31); [Job 1:20](/job#Job.1.20)).

The Mosiac law prohibited any compensation for murder or the reprieve of the murderer ([Ex. 21:12](/exod#Exod.21.12), [14](/exod#Exod.21.14); [Deut. 19:11](/deut#Deut.19.11), [13](/deut#Deut.19.13); [2 Sam. 17:25](/2sam#2Sam.17.25); [20:10](/2sam#2Sam.20.10)).

Their whole history and literature afford abundant evidence of this. After the Deluge, the first mention of music is in the account of Laban’s interview with Jacob ([Gen. 31:27](/gen#Gen.31.27)). After their triumphal passage of the Red Sea, Moses and the children of Israel sang their song of deliverance ([Ex. 15](/exod#Exod.15)).

 But the period of Samuel, David, and Solomon was the golden age of Hebrew music, as it was of Hebrew poetry. Music was now for the first time systematically cultivated. It was an essential part of training in the schools of the prophets ([1 Sam. 10:5](/1sam#1Sam.10.5); [19:19-24](/1sam#1Sam.19.19); [2 Kings 3:15](/2kgs#2Kgs.3.15); [1 Chr. 25:6](/1chr#1Chr.25.6)). There now arose also a class of professional singers ([2 Sam. 19:35](/2sam#2Sam.19.35); [Eccl. 2:8](/eccl#Eccl.2.8)). The temple, however, was the great school of music.

He was “very great, and he had 3,000 sheep and 1,000 goats...but the man was churlish and evil in his doings.” During his wanderings David came into that district, and hearing that Nabal was about to shear his sheep, he sent ten of his young men to ask “whatsoever cometh unto thy hand for thy servants.” Nabal insultingly resented the demand, saying, “Who is David, and who is the son of Jesse?” ([1 Sam. 25:10](/1sam#1Sam.25.10), [11](/1sam#1Sam.25.11)). One of the shepherds that stood by and saw the reception David’s messengers had met with, informed Abigail, Nabal’s wife, who at once realized the danger that threatened her household. She forthwith proceeded to the camp of David, bringing with her ample stores of provisions (25:18). She so courteously and persuasively pled her cause that David’s anger was appeased, and he said to her, “Blessed be the Lord God of Israel which sent thee this day to meet me.”

 On her return she found her husband incapable from drunkenness of understanding the state of matters, and not till the following day did she explain to him what had happened. He was stunned by a sense of the danger to which his conduct had exposed him. “His heart died within him, and he became as a stone.” and about ten days after “the Lord smote Nabal that he died” ([1 Sam. 25:37](/1sam#1Sam.25.37), [38](/1sam#1Sam.25.38)).

Naboth,4464,n-p12.3,Naboth,"Fruits, “the Jezreelite,” was the owner of a portion of ground on the eastern slope of the hill of Jezreel ([2 Kings 9:25](/2kgs#2Kgs.9.25), [26](/2kgs#2Kgs.9.26)). This small “plat of ground” seems to have been all he possessed. It was a vineyard, and lay “hard by the palace of Ahab” ([1 Kings 21:1](/1kgs#1Kgs.21.1), [2](/1kgs#1Kgs.21.2)), who greatly coveted it. Naboth, however, refused on any terms to part with it to the king. He had inherited it from his fathers, and no Israelite could lawfully sell his property ([Lev. 25:23](/lev#Lev.25.23)). Jezebel, Ahab’s wife, was grievously offended at Naboth’s refusal to part with his vineyard. By a crafty and cruel plot she compassed his death. His sons also shared his fate ([2 Kings 9:26](/2kgs#2Kgs.9.26); [1 Kings 21:19](/1kgs#1Kgs.21.19)). She then came to Ahab and said, “Arise, take possession of the vineyard; for Naboth is not alive, but dead.” Ahab arose and went forth into the garden which had so treacherously and cruelly been acquired, seemingly enjoying his new possession, when, lo, Elijah suddenly appeared before him and pronounced against him a fearful doom ([1 Kings 21:17-24](/1kgs#1Kgs.21.17)). Jehu and Bidcar were with Ahab at this time, and so deeply were the words of Elijah imprinted on Jehu’s memory that many years afterwards he refers to them ([2 Kings 9:26](/2kgs#2Kgs.9.26)), and he was the chief instrument in inflicting this sentence on Ahab and Jezebel and all their house (9:30-37). The house of Ahab was extinguished by him. Not one of all his great men and his kinsfolk and his priests did Jehu spare (10:11).

 Ahab humbled himself at Elijah’s words ([1 Kings 21:28](/1kgs#1Kgs.21.28), [29](/1kgs#1Kgs.21.29)), and therefore the prophecy was fulfilled not in his fate but in that of his son Joram ([2 Kings 9:25](/2kgs#2Kgs.9.25)).

 The history of Naboth, compared with that of Ahab and Jezebel, furnishes a remarkable illustration of the law of a retributive providence, a law which runs through all history (comp. [Ps. 109:17](/ps#Ps.109.17), [18](/ps#Ps.109.18)).",0.0,person,naboth_2127,naboth_2127,

It was strongly fortified on every side, bidding defiance to every enemy; yet it was to be utterly destroyed as a punishment for the great wickedness of its inhabitants.

It was intended thus to set forth under poetic imagery the future character and history of the tribe.

 At the time of the Exodus this tribe numbered 53,400 adult males ([Num. 1:43](/num#Num.1.43)), but at the close of the wanderings they numbered only 45,400 (26:48-50). Along with Dan and Asher they formed “the camp of Dan,” under a common standard (2:25-31), occupying a place during the march on the north side of the tabernacle.

 The possession assigned to this tribe is set forth in [Josh. 19:32-39](/josh#Josh.19.32). It lay in the north-eastern corner of the land, bounded on the east by the Jordan and the lakes of Merom and Galilee, and on the north it extended far into Coele-Syria, the valley between the two Lebanon ranges. It comprehended a greater variety of rich and beautiful scenery and of soil and climate than fell to the lot of any other tribe. The territory of Naphtali extended to about 800 square miles, being the double of that of Issachar. The region around Kedesh, one of its towns, was originally called Galil, a name afterwards given to the whole northern division of Canaan. A large number of foreigners settled here among the mountains, and hence it was called “Galilee of the Gentiles” (q.v.), [Matt. 4:15](/matt#Matt.4.15), [16](/matt#Matt.4.16). The southern portion of Naphtali has been called the “Garden of Palestine.” It was of unrivalled fertility. It was the principal scene of our Lord’s public ministry. Here most of his parables were spoken and his miracles wrought.

 This tribe was the first to suffer from the invasion of Benhadad, king of Syria, in the reigns of Baasha, king of Israel, and Asa, king of Judah ([1 Kings 15:20](/1kgs#1Kgs.15.20); [2 Chr. 16:4](/2chr#2Chr.16.4)). In the reign of Pekah, king of Israel, the Assyrians under Tiglath-pileser swept over the whole north of Israel, and carried the people into captivity ([2 Kings 15:29](/2kgs#2Kgs.15.29)). Thus the kingdom of Israel came to an end (B.C. 722).

Nazarene,4510,n-p60.2,Nazarene,"This epithet (Gr. Nazaraios) is applied to Christ only once ([Matt. 2:23](/matt#Matt.2.23)).

When this Greek designation was at first applied to our Lord, it was meant simply to denote the place of his residence. In course of time the word became a term of reproach. Thus the word “Nazarene” carries with it an allusion to those prophecies which speak of Christ as “despised of men” ([Isa. 53:3](/isa#Isa.53.3)). Some, however, think that in this name there is an allusion to the Hebrew netser, which signifies a branch or sprout. It is so applied to the Messiah ([Isa. 11:1](/isa#Isa.11.1)), i.e., he whom the prophets called the Netse, the “Branch.”

Nazareth,4511,n-p62.3,Nazareth,"Separated, generally supposed to be the Greek form of the Hebrew netser, a “shoot” or “sprout.” Some, however, think that the name of the city must be connected with the name of the hill behind it, from which one of the finest prospects in Palestine is obtained, and accordingly they derive it from the Hebrew notserah, i.e., one guarding or watching, thus designating the hill which overlooks and thus guards an extensive region.

 This city is not mentioned in the Old Testament. It was the home of Joseph and Mary ([Luke 2:39](/luke#Luke.2.39)), and here the angel announced to the Virgin the birth of the Messiah (1:26-28). Here Jesus grew up from his infancy to manhood (4:16); and here he began his public ministry in the synagogue ([Matt. 13:54](/matt#Matt.13.54)), at which the people were so offended that they sought to cast him down from the precipice whereon their city was built ([Luke 4:29](/luke#Luke.4.29)). Twice they expelled him from their borders (4:16-29; [Matt. 13:54-58](/matt#Matt.13.54)); and he finally retired from the city, where he did not many mighty works because of their unbelief ([Matt. 13:58](/matt#Matt.13.58)), and took up his residence in Capernaum.

 Nazareth is situated among the southern ridges of Lebanon, on the steep slope of a hill, about 14 miles from the Sea of Galilee and about 6 west from Mount Tabor. It is identified with the modern village en-Nazirah, of six or ten thousand inhabitants. It lies “as in a hollow cup” lower down upon the hill than the ancient city. The main road for traffic between Egypt and the interior of Asia passed by Nazareth near the foot of Tabor, and thence northward to Damascus.

 It is supposed from the words of Nathanael in [John 1:46](/john#John.1.46) that the city of Nazareth was held in great disrepute, either because, it is said, the people of Galilee were a rude and less cultivated class, and were largely influenced by the Gentiles who mingled with them, or because of their lower type of moral and religious character. But there seems to be no sufficient reason for these suppositions. The Jews believed that, according to [Micah 5:2](/mic#Mic.5.2), the birth of the Messiah would take place at Bethlehem, and nowhere else. Nathanael held the same opinion as his countrymen, and believed that the great “good” which they were all expecting could not come from Nazareth. This is probably what Nathanael meant. Moreover, there does not seem to be any evidence that the inhabitants of Galilee were in any respect inferior, or that a Galilean was held in contempt, in the time of our Lord.

 The population of this city (now about 10,000) in the time of Christ probably amounted to 15,000 or 20,000 souls.

 “The so-called ‘Holy House’ is a cave under the Latin church, which appears to have been originally a tank. The ‘brow of the hill’, site of the attempted precipitation, is probably the northern cliff: the traditional site has been shown since the middle ages at some distance to the south. None of the traditional sites are traceable very early, and they have no authority. The name Nazareth perhaps means ‘a watch tower’ (now en-Nasrah), but is connected in the New Testament with Netzer, ’a branch’ ([Isa. 4:2](/isa#Isa.4.2); [Jer. 23:5](/jer#Jer.23.5); [Zech. 3:8](/zech#Zech.3.8); [6:12](/zech#Zech.6.12); [Matt. 2:23](/matt#Matt.2.23)), Nazarene being quite a different word from Nazarite.”",0.0,place,nazareth_878,,nazareth_878
Nazarite,4512,n-p68.6,Nazarite,"(Heb. form Nazirite), the name of such Israelites as took on them the vow prescribed in [Num. 6:2-21](/num#Num.6.2). The word denotes generally one who is separated from others and consecrated to God. Although there is no mention of any Nazarite before Samson, yet it is evident that they existed before the time of Moses. The vow of a Nazarite involved these three things, (1) abstinence from wine and strong drink, (2) refraining from cutting the hair off the head during the whole period of the continuance of the vow, and (3) the avoidance of contact with the dead.

 When the period of the continuance of the vow came to an end, the Nazarite had to present himself at the door of the sanctuary with (1) a he lamb of the first year for a burnt-offering, (2) a ewe lamb of the first year for a sin-offering, and (3) a ram for a peace-offering. After these sacrifices were offered by the priest, the Nazarite cut off his hair at the door and threw it into the fire under the peace-offering.

 For some reason, probably in the midst of his work at Corinth, Paul took on himself the Nazarite vow. This could only be terminated by his going up to Jerusalem to offer up the hair which till then was to be left uncut. But it seems to have been allowable for persons at a distance to cut the hair, which was to be brought up to Jerusalem, where the ceremony was completed. This Paul did at Cenchrea just before setting out on his voyage into Syria ([Acts 18:18](/acts#Acts.18.18)).

 On another occasion ([Acts 21:23-26](/acts#Acts.21.23)), at the feast of Pentecost, Paul took on himself again the Nazarite vow. “The ceremonies involved took a longer time than Paul had at his disposal, but the law permitted a man to share the vow if he could find companions who had gone through the prescribed ceremonies, and who permitted him to join their company. This permission was commonly granted if the new comer paid all the fees required from the whole company (fee to the Levite for cutting the hair and fees for sacrifices), and finished the vow along with the others. Four Jewish Christians were performing the vow, and would admit Paul to their company, provided he paid their expenses. Paul consented, paid the charges, and when the last seven days of the vow began he went with them to live in the temple, giving the usual notice to the priests that he had joined in regular fashion, was a sharer with the four men, and that his vow would end with theirs. Nazarites retired to the temple during the last period of seven days, because they could be secure there against any accidental defilement” (Lindsay’s Acts).

 As to the duration of a Nazarite’s vow, every one was left at liberty to fix his own time. There is mention made in Scripture of only three who were Nazarites for life, Samson, Samuel, and John the Baptist ([Judg. 13:4](/judg#Judg.13.4), [5](/judg#Judg.13.5); [1 Sam. 1:11](/1sam#1Sam.1.11); [Luke 1:15](/luke#Luke.1.15)). In its ordinary form, however, the Nazarite’s vow lasted only thirty, and at most one hundred, days.

Nebuchadnezzar,4525,n-p84.3,Nebuchadnezzar,"In the Babylonian orthography Nabu-kudur-uzur, which means “Nebo, protect the crown!” or the “frontiers.” In an inscription he styles himself “Nebo’s favourite.” He was the son and successor of Nabopolassar, who delivered Babylon from its dependence on Assyria and laid Nineveh in ruins. He was the greatest and most powerful of all the Babylonian kings. He married the daughter of Cyaxares, and thus the Median and Babylonian dynasties were united.

 Necho II., the king of Egypt, gained a victory over the Assyrians at Carchemish. This secured to Egypt the possession of the Syrian provinces of Assyria, including Palestine. The remaining provinces of the Assyrian empire were divided between Babylonia and Media. But Nabopolassar was ambitious of reconquering from Necho the western provinces of Syria, and for this purpose he sent his son with a powerful army westward ([Dan. 1:1](/dan#Dan.1.1)). The Egyptians met him at Carchemish, where a furious battle was fought, resulting in the complete rout of the Egyptians, who were driven back ([Jer. 46:2-12](/jer#Jer.46.2)), and Syria and Phoenicia brought under the sway of Babylon (B.C. 606). From that time “the king of Egypt came not again any more out of his land” ([2 Kings 24:7](/2kgs#2Kgs.24.7)). Nebuchadnezzar also subdued the whole of Palestine, and took Jerusalem, carrying away captive a great multitude of the Jews, among whom were Daniel and his companions ([Dan. 1:1](/dan#Dan.1.1), [2](/dan#Dan.1.2); [Jer. 27:19](/jer#Jer.27.19); [40:1](/jer#Jer.40.1)).

 Three years after this, Jehoiakim, who had reigned in Jerusalem as a Babylonian vassal, rebelled against the oppressor, trusting to help from Egypt ([2 Kings 24:1](/2kgs#2Kgs.24.1)). This led Nebuchadnezzar to march an army again to the conquest of Jerusalem, which at once yielded to him (B.C. 598). A third time he came against it, and deposed Jehoiachin, whom he carried into Babylon, with a large portion of the population of the city, and the sacred vessels of the temple, placing Zedekiah on the throne of Judah in his stead. He also, heedless of the warnings of the prophet, entered into an alliance with Egypt, and rebelled against Babylon. This brought about the final siege of the city, which was at length taken and utterly destroyed (B.C. 586). Zedekiah was taken captive, and had his eyes put out by order of the king of Babylon, who made him a prisoner for the remainder of his life.

 An onyx cameo, now in the museum of Florence, bears on it an arrow-headed inscription, which is certainly ancient and genuine. The helmeted profile is said (Schrader) to be genuine also, but it is more probable that it is the portrait of a usurper in the time of Darius (Hystaspes), called Nidinta-Bel, who took the name of “Nebuchadrezzar.” The inscription has been thus translated:, “In honour of Merodach, his lord, Nebuchadnezzar, king of Babylon, in his lifetime had this made.”

 A clay tablet, now in the British Museum, bears the following inscription, the only one as yet found which refers to his wars: “In the thirty-seventh year of Nebuchadnezzar, king of the country of Babylon, he went to Egypt [Misr] to make war. Amasis, king of Egypt, collected [his army], and marched and spread abroad.” Thus were fulfilled the words of the prophet ([Jer. 46:13-26](/jer#Jer.46.13); [Ezek. 29:2-20](/ezek#Ezek.29.2)). Having completed the subjugation of Phoenicia, and inflicted chastisement on Egypt, Nebuchadnezzar now set himself to rebuild and adorn the city of Babylon ([Dan. 4:30](/dan#Dan.4.30)), and to add to the greatness and prosperity of his kingdom by constructing canals and aqueducts and reservoirs surpassing in grandeur and magnificence everything of the kind mentioned in history ([Dan. 2:37](/dan#Dan.2.37)). He is represented as a “king of kings,” ruling over a vast kingdom of many provinces, with a long list of officers and rulers under him, “princes, governors, captains,” etc. (3:2, 3, 27). He may, indeed, be said to have created the mighty empire over which he ruled.

 “Modern research has shown that Nebuchadnezzar was the greatest monarch that Babylon, or perhaps the East generally, ever produced. He must have possessed an enormous command of human labour, nine-tenths of Babylon itself, and nineteen-twentieths of all the other ruins that in almost countless profusion cover the land, are composed of bricks stamped with his name. He appears to have built or restored almost every city and temple in the whole country. His inscriptions give an elaborate account of the immense works which he constructed in and about Babylon itself, abundantly illustrating the boast, ‘Is not this great Babylon which I have build?’” Rawlinson, Hist. Illustrations.

 After the incident of the “burning fiery furnace” ([Dan. 3](/dan#Dan.3)) into which the three Hebrew confessors were cast, Nebuchadnezzar was afflicted with some peculiar mental aberration as a punishment for his pride and vanity, probably the form of madness known as lycanthropy (i.e, “the change of a man into a wolf”). A remarkable confirmation of the Scripture narrative is afforded by the recent discovery of a bronze door-step, which bears an inscription to the effect that it was presented by Nebuchadnezzar to the great temple at Borsippa as a votive offering on account of his recovery from a terrible illness.

 He survived his recovery for some years, and died B.C. 562, in the eighty-third or eighty-fourth year of his age, after a reign of forty-three years, and was succeeded by his son Evil-merodach, who, after a reign of two years, was succeeded by Neriglissar (559-555), who was succeeded by Nabonadius (555-538), at the close of whose reign (less than a quarter of a century after the death of Nebuchadnezzar) Babylon fell under Cyrus at the head of the combined armies of Media and Persia.

Necho II,4529,n-p96.4,Necho II,"An Egyptian king, the son and successor of Psammetichus (B.C. 610-594), the contemporary of Josiah, king of Judah. For some reason he proclaimed war against the king of Assyria. He led forth a powerful army and marched northward, but was met by the king of Judah at Megiddo, who refused him a passage through his territory. Here a fierce battle was fought and Josiah was slain ([2 Chr. 35:20-24](/2chr#2Chr.35.20)). Possibly, as some suppose, Necho may have brought his army by sea to some port to the north of Dor (comp. [Josh. 11:2](/josh#Josh.11.2); [12:23](/josh#Josh.12.23)), a Phoenician town at no great distance from Megiddo. After this battle Necho marched on to Carchemish (q.v.), where he met and conquered the Assyrian army, and thus all the Syrian provinces, including Palestine, came under his dominion.

 On his return march he deposed Jehoahaz, who had succeeded his father Josiah, and made Eliakim, Josiah’s eldest son, whose name he changed into Jehoiakim, king. Jehoahaz he carried down into Egypt, where he died ([2 Kings 23:31](/2kgs#2Kgs.23.31); [2 Chr. 36:1-4](/2chr#2Chr.36.1)). Four years after this conquest Necho again marched to the Euphrates; but here he was met and his army routed by the Chaldeans (B.C. 606) under Nebuchadnezzar, who drove the Egyptians back, and took from them all the territory they had conquered, from the Euphrates unto the “river of Egypt” ([Jer. 46:2](/jer#Jer.46.2); [2 Kings 24:7](/2kgs#2Kgs.24.7), [8](/2kgs#2Kgs.24.8)).

Nehemiah 3,4540,n-p105.4,Nehemiah,"The son of Hachaliah ([Neh. 1:1](/neh#Neh.1.1)), and probably of the tribe of Judah. His family must have belonged to Jerusalem ([Neh. 2:3](/neh#Neh.2.3)). He was one of the “Jews of the dispersion,” and in his youth was appointed to the important office of royal cup-bearer at the palace of Shushan. The king, Artaxerxes Longimanus, seems to have been on terms of friendly familiarity with his attendant. Through his brother Hanani, and perhaps from other sources ([Neh. 1:2](/neh#Neh.1.2); [2:3](/neh#Neh.2.3)), he heard of the mournful and desolate condition of the Holy City, and was filled with sadness of heart. For many days he fasted and mourned and prayed for the place of his fathers’ sepulchres. At length the king observed his sadness of countenance and asked the reason of it. Nehemiah explained it all to the king, and obtained his permission to go up to Jerusalem and there to act as tirshatha, or governor of Judea. He went up in the spring of B.C. 446 (eleven years after Ezra), with a strong escort supplied by the king, and with letters to all the pashas of the provinces through which he had to pass, as also to Asaph, keeper of the royal forests, directing him to assist Nehemiah. On his arrival he set himself to survey the city, and to form a plan for its restoration; a plan which he carried out with great skill and energy, so that the whole was completed in about six months. He remained in Judea for thirteen years as governor, carrying out many reforms, notwithstanding much opposition that he encountered ([Neh. 13:11](/neh#Neh.13.11)). He built up the state on the old lines, “supplementing and completing the work of Ezra,” and making all arrangements for the safety and good government of the city. At the close of this important period of his public life, he returned to Persia to the service of his royal master at Shushan or Ecbatana. Very soon after this the old corrupt state of things returned, showing the worthlessness to a large extent of the professions that had been made at the feast of the dedication of the walls of the city ([Neh. 12](/neh#Neh.12). See EZRA). Malachi now appeared among the people with words of stern reproof and solemn warning; and Nehemiah again returned from Persia (after an absence of some two years), and was grieved to see the widespread moral degeneracy that had taken place during his absence. He set himself with vigour to rectify the flagrant abuses that had sprung up, and restored the orderly administration of public worship and the outward observance of the law of Moses. Of his subsequent history we know nothing. Probably he remained at his post as governor till his death (about B.C. 413) in a good old age. The place of his death and burial is, however, unknown. “He resembled Ezra in his fiery zeal, in his active spirit of enterprise, and in the piety of his life: but he was of a bluffer and a fiercer mood; he had less patience with transgressors; he was a man of action rather than a man of thought, and more inclined to use force than persuasion. His practical sagacity and high courage were very markedly shown in the arrangement with which he carried through the rebuilding of the wall and balked the cunning plans of the ‘adversaries.’ The piety of his heart, his deeply religious spirit and constant sense of communion with and absolute dependence upon God, are strikingly exhibited, first in the long prayer recorded in ch. 1:5-11, and secondly and most remarkably in what have been called his ‘interjectional prayers’, those short but moving addresses to Almighty God which occur so frequently in his writings, the instinctive outpouring of a heart deeply moved, but ever resting itself upon God, and looking to God alone for aid in trouble, for the frustration of evil designs, and for final reward and acceptance” (Rawlinson). Nehemiah was the last of the governors sent from the Persian court. Judea after this was annexed to the satrapy of Coele-Syria, and was governed by the high priest under the jurisdiction of the governor of Syria, and the internal government of the country became more and more a hierarchy.",3.0,person,nehemiah_2172,nehemiah_2172,

From profane history and the inscriptions, we are led to conclude that he was the Neriglissar who murdered Evil-merodach, the son of Nebuchadnezzar, and succeeded him on the throne of Babylon (B.C. 559-556). He was married to a daughter of Nebuchadnezzar. The ruins of a palace, the only one on the right bank of the Euphrates, bear inscriptions denoting that it was built by this king. He was succeeded by his son, a mere boy, who was murdered after a reign of some nine months by a conspiracy of the nobles, one of whom, Nabonadius, ascended the vacant throne, and reigned for a period of seventeen years (B.C. 555-538), at the close of which period Babylon was taken by Cyrus. Belshazzar, who comes into notice in connection with the taking of Babylon, was by some supposed to have been the same as Nabonadius, who was called Nebuchadnezzar’s son ([Dan. 5:11](/dan#Dan.5.11), [18](/dan#Dan.5.18), [22](/dan#Dan.5.22)), because he had married his daughter. But it is known from the inscriptions that Nabonadius had a son called Belshazzar, who may have been his father’s associate on the throne at the time of the fall of Babylon, and who therefore would be the grandson of Nebuchadnezzar.

Nero,4562,n-p124.5,Nero,"Occurs only in the superscription (which is probably spurious, and is altogether omitted in the R.V.) to the Second Epistle to Timothy. He became emperor of Rome when he was about seventeen years of age (A.D. 54), and soon began to exhibit the character of a cruel tyrant and heathen debauchee. In May A.D. 64, a terrible conflagration broke out in Rome, which raged for six days and seven nights, and totally destroyed a great part of the city. The guilt of this fire was attached to him at the time, and the general verdict of history accuses him of the crime. “Hence, to suppress the rumour,” says Tacitus (Annals, xv. 44), “he falsely charged with the guilt, and punished with the most exquisite tortures, the persons commonly called Christians, who are hated for their enormities. Christus, the founder of that name, was put to death as a criminal by Pontius Pilate, procurator of Judea, in the reign of Tiberius; but the pernicious superstition, repressed for a time, broke out again, not only throughout Judea, where the mischief originated, but through the city of Rome also, whither all things horrible and disgraceful flow, from all quarters, as to a common receptacle, and where they are encouraged. Accordingly, first three were seized, who confessed they were Christians. Next, on their information, a vast multitude were convicted, not so much on the charge of burning the city as of hating the human race. And in their deaths they were also made the subjects of sport; for they were covered with the hides of wild beasts and worried to death by dogs, or nailed to crosses, or set fire to, and, when day declined, burned to serve for nocturnal lights. Nero offered his own gardens for that spectacle, and exhibited a Circensian game, indiscriminately mingling with the common people in the habit of a charioteer, or else standing in his chariot; whence a feeling of compassion arose toward the sufferers, though guilty and deserving to be made examples of by capital punishment, because they seemed not to be cut off for the public good, but victims to the ferocity of one man.” Another Roman historian, Suetonius (Nero, xvi.), says of him: “He likewise inflicted punishments on the Christians, a sort of people who hold a new and impious superstition” (Forbes’s Footsteps of St. Paul, p. 60).

 Nero was the emperor before whom Paul was brought on his first imprisonment at Rome, and the apostle is supposed to have suffered martyrdom during this persecution. He is repeatedly alluded to in Scripture ([Acts 25:11](/acts#Acts.25.11); [Phil. 1:12](/phil#Phil.1.12), [13](/phil#Phil.1.13); 4:22). He died A.D. 68.",0.0,unmatched,unmatched,,

The tradition is that the Gibeonites ([Josh. 9:27](/josh#Josh.9.27)) were the original caste, afterwards called Nethinim. Their numbers were added to afterwards from captives taken in battle; and they were formally given by David to the Levites ([Ezra 8:20](/ezra#Ezra.8.20)), and so were called Nethinim, i.e., the given ones, given to the Levites to be their servants. Only 612 Nethinim returned from Babylon ([Ezra 2:58](/ezra#Ezra.2.58); [8:20](/ezra#Ezra.8.20)). They were under the control of a chief from among themselves (2:43; [Neh. 7:46](/neh#Neh.7.46)).

Nineveh,4607,n-p164.3,Nineveh,"First mentioned in [Gen. 10:11](/gen#Gen.10.11), which is rendered in the Revised Version, “He [i.e., Nimrod] went forth into Assyria and builded Nineveh.” It is not again noticed till the days of Jonah, when it is described ([Jonah 3:3](/jonah#Jonah.3.3); [4:11](/jonah#Jonah.4.11)) as a great and populous city, the flourishing capital of the Assyrian empire ([2 Kings 19:36](/2kgs#2Kgs.19.36); [Isa. 37:37](/isa#Isa.37.37)). The book of the prophet Nahum is almost exclusively taken up with prophetic denunciations against this city. Its ruin and utter desolation are foretold ([Nah. 1:14](/nah#Nah.1.14); [3:19](/nah#Nah.3.19), etc.). Zephaniah also (2:13-15) predicts its destruction along with the fall of the empire of which it was the capital. From this time there is no mention of it in Scripture till it is named in gospel history ([Matt. 12:41](/matt#Matt.12.41); [Luke 11:32](/luke#Luke.11.32)).

 This “exceeding great city” lay on the eastern or left bank of the river Tigris, along which it stretched for some 30 miles, having an average breadth of 10 miles or more from the river back toward the eastern hills. This whole extensive space is now one immense area of ruins. Occupying a central position on the great highway between the Mediterranean and the Indian Ocean, thus uniting the East and the West, wealth flowed into it from many sources, so that it became the greatest of all ancient cities.

 About B.C. 633 the Assyrian empire began to show signs of weakness, and Nineveh was attacked by the Medes, who subsequently, about B.C. 625, being joined by the Babylonians and Susianians, again attacked it, when it fell, and was razed to the ground. The Assyrian empire then came to an end, the Medes and Babylonians dividing its provinces between them. “After having ruled for more than six hundred years with hideous tyranny and violence, from the Caucasus and the Caspian to the Persian Gulf, and from beyond the Tigris to Asia Minor and Egypt, it vanished like a dream” ([Nah. 2:6-11](/nah#Nah.2.6)). Its end was strange, sudden, tragic. It was God’s doing, his judgement on Assyria’s pride ([Isa. 10:5-19](/isa#Isa.10.5)).

 Forty years ago our knowledge of the great Assyrian empire and of its magnificent capital was almost wholly a blank. Vague memories had indeed survived of its power and greatness, but very little was definitely known about it. Other cities which had perished, as Palmyra, Persepolis, and Thebes, had left ruins to mark their sites and tell of their former greatness; but of this city, imperial Nineveh, not a single vestige seemed to remain, and the very place on which it had stood was only matter of conjecture. In fulfilment of prophecy, God made “an utter end of the place.” It became a “desolation.”

 In the days of the Greek historian Herodotus, B.C. 400, it had become a thing of the past; and when Xenophon the historian passed the place in the “Retreat of the Ten Thousand,” the very memory of its name had been lost. It was buried out of sight, and no one knew its grave. It is never again to rise from its ruins.

 At length, after being lost for more than two thousand years, the city was disentombed. A little more than forty years ago the French consul at Mosul began to search the vast mounds that lay along the opposite bank of the river. The Arabs whom he employed in these excavations, to their great surprise, came upon the ruins of a building at the mound of Khorsabad, which, on further exploration, turned out to be the royal palace of Sargon, one of the Assyrian kings. They found their way into its extensive courts and chambers, and brought forth form its hidded depths many wonderful sculptures and other relics of those ancient times.

 The work of exploration has been carried on almost continuously by M. Botta, Sir Henry Layard, George Smith, and others, in the mounds of Nebi-Yunus, Nimrud, Koyunjik, and Khorsabad, and a vast treasury of specimens of old Assyrian art has been exhumed. Palace after palace has been discovered, with their decorations and their sculptured slabs, revealing the life and manners of this ancient people, their arts of war and peace, the forms of their religion, the style of their architecture, and the magnificence of their monarchs. The streets of the city have been explored, the inscriptions on the bricks and tablets and sculptured figures have been read, and now the secrets of their history have been brought to light.

 One of the most remarkable of recent discoveries is that of the library of King Assur-bani-pal, or, as the Greek historians call him, Sardanapalos, the grandson of Sennacherib (q.v.). This library consists of about ten thousand flat bricks or tablets, all written over with Assyrian characters. They contain a record of the history, the laws, and the religion of Assyria, of the greatest value. These strange clay leaves found in the royal library form the most valuable of all the treasuries of the literature of the old world. The library contains also old Accadian documents, which are the oldest extant documents in the world, dating as far back as probably about the time of Abraham.

 “The Assyrian royalty is, perhaps, the most luxurious of our century [reign of Assur-bani-pa]...Its victories and conquests, uninterrupted for one hundred years, have enriched it with the spoil of twenty peoples. Sargon has taken what remained to the Hittites; Sennacherib overcame Chaldea, and the treasures of Babylon were transferred to his coffers; Esarhaddon and Assur-bani-pal himself have pillaged Egypt and her great cities, Sais, Memphis, and Thebes of the hundred gates...Now foreign merchants flock into Nineveh, bringing with them the most valuable productions from all countries, gold and perfume from South Arabia and the Chaldean Sea, Egyptian linen and glass-work, carved enamels, goldsmiths’ work, tin, silver, Phoenician purple; cedar wood from Lebanon, unassailable by worms; furs and iron from Asia Minor and Armenia” (Ancient Egypt and Assyria, by G. Maspero, page 271).

 The bas-reliefs, alabaster slabs, and sculptured monuments found in these recovered palaces serve in a remarkable manner to confirm the Old Testament history of the kings of Israel. The appearance of the ruins shows that the destruction of the city was due not only to the assailing foe but also to the flood and the fire, thus confirming the ancient prophecies concerning it. “The recent excavations,” says Rawlinson, “have shown that fire was a great instrument in the destruction of the Nineveh palaces. Calcined alabaster, charred wood, and charcoal, colossal statues split through with heat, are met with in parts of the Nineveh mounds, and attest the veracity of prophecy.”

 Nineveh in its glory was ([Jonah 3:4](/jonah#Jonah.3.4)) an “exceeding great city of three days’ journey”, i.e., probably in circuit. This would give a circumference of about 60 miles. At the four corners of an irregular quadrangle are the ruins of Kouyunjik, Nimrud, Karamless and Khorsabad. These four great masses of ruins, with the whole area included within the parallelogram they form by lines drawn from the one to the other, are generally regarded as composing the whole ruins of Nineveh.",0.0,place,nineveh_899,,nineveh_899

In [Ezek. 30:14](/ezek#Ezek.30.14), [16](/ezek#Ezek.30.16) it is simply called “No;” but in ver. 15 the name has the Hebrew Hamon prefixed to it, “Hamon No.” This prefix is probably the name simply of the god usually styled Amon or Ammon. In [Nah. 3:8](/nah#Nah.3.8) the “populous No” of the Authorized Version is in the Revised Version correctly rendered “No-Amon.”

 It was the Diospolis or Thebes of the Greeks, celebrated for its hundred gates and its vast population. It stood on both sides of the Nile, and is by some supposed to have included Karnak and Luxor. In grandeur and extent it can only be compared to Nineveh. It is mentioned only in the prophecies referred to, which point to its total destruction. It was first taken by the Assyrians in the time of Sargon ([Isa. 20](/isa#Isa.20)). It was afterwards “delivered into the hand” of Nebuchadnezzar and Assurbani-pal ([Jer. 46:25](/jer#Jer.46.25), [26](/jer#Jer.46.26)). Cambyses, king of the Persians (B.C. 525), further laid it waste by fire. Its ruin was completed (B.C. 81) by Ptolemy Lathyrus. The ruins of this city are still among the most notable in the valley of the Nile. They have formed a great storehouse of interesting historic remains for more than two thousand years. “As I wandered day after day with ever-growing amazement amongst these relics of ancient magnificence, I felt that if all the ruins in Europe, classical, Celtic, and medieval, were brought together into one centre, they would fall far short both in extent and grandeur of those of this single Egyptian city.” Manning, The Land of the Pharaohs.",0.0,unmatched,unmatched,,

Noah,4615,n-p182.2,Noah,"Rest, (Heb. Noah) the grandson of Methuselah ([Gen. 5:25-29](/gen#Gen.5.25)), who was for two hundred and fifty years contemporary with Adam, and the son of Lamech, who was about fifty years old at the time of Adam’s death. This patriarch is rightly regarded as the connecting link between the old and the new world. He is the second great progenitor of the human family.

 The words of his father Lamech at his birth ([Gen. 5:29](/gen#Gen.5.29)) have been regarded as in a sense prophetical, designating Noah as a type of Him who is the true “rest and comfort” of men under the burden of life ([Matt. 11:28](/matt#Matt.11.28)).

 He lived five hundred years, and then there were born unto him three sons, Shem, Ham, and Japheth ([Gen. 5:32](/gen#Gen.5.32)). He was a “just man and perfect in his generation,” and “walked with God” (comp. [Ezek. 14:14](/ezek#Ezek.14.14), [20](/ezek#Ezek.14.20)). But now the descendants of Cain and of Seth began to intermarry, and then there sprang up a race distinguished for their ungodliness. Men became more and more corrupt, and God determined to sweep the earth of its wicked population ([Gen. 6:7](/gen#Gen.6.7)). But with Noah God entered into a covenant, with a promise of deliverance from the threatened deluge (18). He was accordingly commanded to build an ark (6:14-16) for the saving of himself and his house. An interval of one hundred and twenty years elapsed while the ark was being built (6:3), during which Noah bore constant testimony against the unbelief and wickedness of that generation ([1 Pet. 3:18-20](/1pet#1Pet.3.18); 2 Pet. 2:5).

 When the ark of “gopher-wood” (mentioned only here) was at length completed according to the command of the Lord, the living creatures that were to be preserved entered into it; and then Noah and his wife and sons and daughters-in-law entered it, and the “Lord shut him in” ([Gen. 7:16](/gen#Gen.7.16)). The judgment-threatened now fell on the guilty world, “the world that then was, being overflowed with water, perished” (2 Pet. 3:6). The ark floated on the waters for one hundred and fifty days, and then rested on the mountains of Ararat ([Gen. 8:3](/gen#Gen.8.3), [4](/gen#Gen.8.4)); but not for a considerable time after this was divine permission given him to leave the ark, so that he and his family were a whole year shut up within it ([Gen. 6](/gen#Gen.6)-14).

 On leaving the ark Noah’s first act was to erect an altar, the first of which there is any mention, and offer the sacrifices of adoring thanks and praise to God, who entered into a covenant with him, the first covenant between God and man, granting him possession of the earth by a new and special charter, which remains in force to the present time ([Gen. 8:21-9:17](/gen#Gen.8.21)). As a sign and witness of this covenant, the rainbow was adopted and set apart by God, as a sure pledge that never again would the earth be destroyed by a flood.

 But, alas! Noah after this fell into grievous sin ([Gen. 9:21](/gen#Gen.9.21)); and the conduct of Ham on this sad occasion led to the memorable prediction regarding his three sons and their descendants. Noah “lived after the flood three hundred and fifty years, and he died” (28:29)..

This identification does not meet these conditions, and hence others (as Dean Stanley) think that it was the northern summit of Mount Olivet, the place where David “worshipped God” when fleeing from Absalom ([2 Sam. 15:32](/2sam#2Sam.15.32)), or more probably (Conder) that it was the same as Mizpeh (q.v.), [Judg. 20:1](/judg#Judg.20.1); [Josh. 18:26](/josh#Josh.18.26); [1 Sam. 7:16](/1sam#1Sam.7.16), at Nebi Samwil, about 5 miles north-west of Jerusalem.

Numbering of the people,4629,n-p202.5,Numbering of the people,"Besides the numbering of the tribes mentioned in the history of the wanderings in the wilderness, we have an account of a general census of the whole nation from Dan to Beersheba, which David gave directions to Joab to make ([1 Chr. 21:1](/1chr#1Chr.21.1)). Joab very reluctantly began to carry out the king’s command.

 This act of David in ordering a numbering of the people arose from pride and a self-glorifying spirit. It indicated a reliance on his part on an arm of flesh, an estimating of his power not by the divine favour but by the material resources of his kingdom. He thought of military achievement and of conquest, and forgot that he was God’s vicegerent. In all this he sinned against God. While Joab was engaged in the census, David’s heart smote him, and he became deeply conscious of his fault; and in profound humiliation he confessed, “I have sinned greatly in what I have done.” The prophet Gad was sent to him to put before him three dreadful alternatives ([2 Sam. 24:13](/2sam#2Sam.24.13); for “seven years” in this verse, the LXX. and [1 Chr. 21:12](/1chr#1Chr.21.12) have “three years”), three of Jehovah’s four sore judgments ([Ezek. 14:21](/ezek#Ezek.14.21)). Two of these David had already experienced. He had fled for some months before Absalom, and had suffered three years’ famine on account of the slaughter of the Gibeonites. In his “strait” David said, “Let me fall into the hands of the Lord.” A pestilence broke out among the people, and in three days swept away 70,000. At David’s intercession the plague was stayed, and at the threshing-floor of Araunah (q.v.), where the destroying angel was arrested in his progress, David erected an altar, and there offered up sacrifies to God ([2 Chr. 3:1](/2chr#2Chr.3.1)).

 The census, so far as completed, showed that there were at least 1,300,000 fighting men in the kingdom, indicating at that time a population of about six or seven millions in all.",0.0,unmatched,unmatched,,
"Numbers, Book of",4630,n-p205.2,"Numbers, Book of","The fourth of the books of the Pentateuch, called in the Hebrew be-midbar, i.e., “in the wilderness.” In the LXX. version it is called “Numbers,” and this name is now the usual title of the book. It is so called because it contains a record of the numbering of the people in the wilderness of Sinai (1-4), and of their numbering afterwards on the plain of Moab (26).

 This book is of special historical interest as furnishing us with details as to the route of the Israelites in the wilderness and their principal encampments. It may be divided into three parts:

 1. The numbering of the people at Sinai, and preparations for their resuming their march (1-10:10). The sixth chapter gives an account of the vow of a Nazarite.

 2. An account of the journey from Sinai to Moab, the sending out of the spies and the report they brought back, and the murmurings (eight times) of the people at the hardships by the way (10:11-21:20).

 3. The transactions in the plain of Moab before crossing the Jordan (21:21-ch. 36).

 The period comprehended in the history extends from the second month of the second year after the Exodus to the beginning of the eleventh month of the fortieth year, in all about thirty-eight years and ten months; a dreary period of wanderings, during which that disobedient generation all died in the wilderness. They were fewer in number at the end of their wanderings than when they left the land of Egypt. We see in this history, on the one hand, the unceasing care of the Almighty over his chosen people during their wanderings; and, on the other hand, the murmurings and rebellions by which they offended their heavenly Protector, drew down repeated marks of his displeasure, and provoked him to say that they should “not enter into his rest” because of their unbelief ([Heb. 3:19](/heb#Heb.3.19)).

 This, like the other books of the Pentateuch, bears evidence of having been written by Moses.

 The expression “the book of the wars of the Lord,” occurring in 21:14, has given rise to much discussion. But, after all, “what this book was is uncertain, whether some writing of Israel not now extant, or some writing of the Amorites which contained songs and triumphs of their king Sihon’s victories, out of which Moses may cite this testimony, as Paul sometimes does out of heathen poets ([Acts 17:28](/acts#Acts.17.28); [Titus 1:12](/titus#Titus.1.12)).”",0.0,unmatched,unmatched,,

Tristram says that this oak near Hebron “has for several centuries taken the place of the once renowned terebinth which marked the site of Mamre on the other side of the city. The terebinth existed at Mamre in the time of Vespasian, and under it the captive Jews were sold as slaves. It disappeared about A.D. 330, and no tree now marks the grove of Mamre.

 There are on record the account of four captures of Jerusalem, (1) by Shishak in the reign of Rehoboam ([1 Kings 14:25](/1kgs#1Kgs.14.25)); (2) by the Philistines and Arabians in the reign of Jehoram ([2 Chr. 21:16](/2chr#2Chr.21.16)); (3) by Joash, the king of Israel, in the reign of Amaziah ([2 Kings 14:13](/2kgs#2Kgs.14.13)); and (4) by the Babylonians, when Jerusalem was taken and destroyed by Nebuchadnezzar (B.C. 586). Obadiah (1:11-14) speaks of this capture as a thing past. He sees the calamity as having already come on Jerusalem, and the Edomites as joining their forces with those of the Chaldeans in bringing about the degradation and ruin of Israel. We do not indeed read that the Edomites actually took part with the Chaldeans, but the probabilities are that they did so, and this explains the words of Obadiah in denouncing against Edom the judgments of God. The date of his prophecies was thus in or about the year of the destruction of Jerusalem.

 Edom is the type of Israel’s and of God’s last foe ([Isa. 63:1-4](/isa#Isa.63.1)). These will finally all be vanquished, and the kingdom will be the Lord’s (comp. [Ps. 22:28](/ps#Ps.22.28)).",0.0,unmatched,unmatched,,

Olive-tree,4682,o-p47.8,Olive-tree,"Is frequently mentioned in Scripture. The dove from the ark brought an olive-branch to Noah ([Gen. 8:11](/gen#Gen.8.11)). It is mentioned among the most notable trees of Palestine, where it was cultivated long before the time of the Hebrews ([Deut. 6:11](/deut#Deut.6.11); [8:8](/deut#Deut.8.8)). It is mentioned in the first Old Testament parable, that of Jotham ([Judg. 9:9](/judg#Judg.9.9)), and is named among the blessings of the “good land,” and is at the present day the one characteristic tree of Palestine. The oldest olive-trees in the country are those which are enclosed in the Garden of Gethsemane. It is referred to as an emblem of prosperity and beauty and religious privilege ([Ps. 52:8](/ps#Ps.52.8); [Jer. 11:16](/jer#Jer.11.16); [Hos. 14:6](/hos#Hos.14.6)).

 The “olive-tree, wild by nature” ([Rom. 11:24](/rom#Rom.11.24)), is the shoot or cutting of the good olive-tree which, left ungrafted, grows up to be a “wild olive.” In [Rom. 11:17](/rom#Rom.11.17) Paul refers to the practice of grafting shoots of the wild olive into a “good” olive which has become unfruitful. By such a process the sap of the good olive, by pervading the branch which is “graffed in,” makes it a good branch, bearing good olives. Thus the Gentiles, being a “wild olive,” but now “graffed in,” yield fruit, but only through the sap of the tree into which they have been graffed. This is a process “contrary to nature” (11:24).",0.0,unmatched,unmatched,,

It is first mentioned in connection with David’s flight from Jerusalem through the rebellion of Absalom ([2 Sam. 15:30](/2sam#2Sam.15.30)), and is only once again mentioned in the Old Testament, in [Zech. 14:4](/zech#Zech.14.4). It is, however, frequently alluded to ([1 Kings 11:7](/1kgs#1Kgs.11.7); [2 Kings 23:13](/2kgs#2Kgs.23.13); [Neh. 8:15](/neh#Neh.8.15); [Ezek. 11:23](/ezek#Ezek.11.23)).

 It is frequently mentioned in the New Testament ([Matt. 21:1](/matt#Matt.21.1); [26:30](/matt#Matt.26.30), etc.). It now bears the name of Jebel et-Tur, i.e., “Mount of the Summit;” also sometimes called Jebel ez-Zeitun, i.e., “Mount of Olives.” It is about 200 feet above the level of the city. The road from Jerusalem to Bethany runs as of old over this mount. It was on this mount that Jesus stood when he wept over Jerusalem. “No name in Scripture,” says Dr. Porter, “calls up associations at once so sacred and so pleasing as that of Olivet. The ‘mount’ is so intimately connected with the private, the devotional life of the Saviour, that we read of it and look at it with feelings of deepest interest and affection. Here he often sat with his disciples, telling them of wondrous events yet to come, of the destruction of the Holy City; of the sufferings, the persecution, and the final triumph of his followers ([Matt. 24](/matt#Matt.24)). Here he gave them the beautiful parables of the ten virgins and the five talents (25); here he was wont to retire on each evening for meditation, and prayer, and rest of body, when weary and harassed by the labours and trials of the day ([Luke 21:37](/luke#Luke.21.37)); and here he came on the night of his betrayal to utter that wonderful prayer, ‘O my Father, if it be possible, let this cup pass from me: nevertheless not as I will, but as thou wilt’ ([Matt. 26:39](/matt#Matt.26.39)). And when the cup of God’s wrath had been drunk, and death and the grave conquered, he led his disciples out again over Olivet as far as to Bethany, and after a parting blessing ascended to heaven ([Luke 24:50](/luke#Luke.24.50), [51](/luke#Luke.24.51); [Acts 1:12](/acts#Acts.1.12)).”

 This mount, or rather mountain range, has four summits or peaks: (1) the “Galilee” peak, so called from a tradition that the angels stood here when they spoke to the disciples ([Acts 1:11](/acts#Acts.1.11)); (2) the “Mount of Ascension,” the supposed site of that event, which was, however, somewhere probably nearer Bethany ([Luke 24:51](/luke#Luke.24.51), [52](/luke#Luke.24.52)); (3) the “Prophets,” from the catacombs on its side, called “the prophets’ tombs;” and (4) the “Mount of Corruption,” so called because of the “high places” erected there by Solomon for the idolatrous worship of his foreign wives ([1 Kings 11:7](/1kgs#1Kgs.11.7); [2 Kings 23:13](/2kgs#2Kgs.23.13); Vulg., “Mount of Offence”).",0.0,place,mount_of_olives_828,,"mount_of_olives_828,mount_of_olives_861"

Tirza was for six years the seat of his government.

 In ancient times this city was full of obelisks dedicated to the sun. Of these only one now remains standing. “Cleopatra’s Needle” was one of those which stood in this city in front of the Temple of Tum, i.e., “the sun.” It is now erected on the Thames Embankment, London.

 Pits were also formed for the same purposes, and lined with cement. These were used after the same manner.

 Heated stones, or sand heated by a fire heaped over it, and also flat irons pans, all served as ovens for the preparation of bread. (See [Gen. 18:6](/gen#Gen.18.6); [1 Kings 19:6](/1kgs#1Kgs.19.6).)",0.0,unmatched,unmatched,,

Palace,4741,p-p6.4,Palace,"Used now only of royal dwellings, although originally meaning simply (as the Latin word palatium, from which it is derived, shows) a building surrounded by a fence or a paling. In the Authorized Version there are many different words so rendered, presenting different ideas, such as that of citadel or lofty fortress or royal residence ([Neh. 1:1](/neh#Neh.1.1); [Dan. 8:2](/dan#Dan.8.2)). It is the name given to the temple fortress ([Neh. 2:8](/neh#Neh.2.8)) and to the temple itself ([1 Chr. 29:1](/1chr#1Chr.29.1)). It denotes also a spacious building or a great house ([Dan. 1:4](/dan#Dan.1.4); [4:4](/dan#Dan.4.4), [29](/dan#Dan.4.29): [Esther 1:5](/esth#Esth.1.5); [7:7](/esth#Esth.7.7)), and a fortified place or an enclosure ([Ezek. 25:4](/ezek#Ezek.25.4)). Solomon’s palace is described in [1 Kings 7:1-12](/1kgs#1Kgs.7.1) as a series of buildings rather than a single great structure. Thirteen years were spent in their erection. This palace stood on the eastern hill, adjoining the temple on the south.

 In the New Testament it designates the official residence of Pilate or that of the high priest ([Matt. 26:3](/matt#Matt.26.3), [58](/matt#Matt.26.58), [69](/matt#Matt.26.69); [Mark 14:54](/mark#Mark.14.54), [66](/mark#Mark.14.66); [John 18:15](/john#John.18.15)). In [Phil. 1:13](/phil#Phil.1.13) this word is the rendering of the Greek praitorion, meaning the praetorian cohorts at Rome (the life-guard of the Caesars). Paul was continually chained to a soldier of that corps ([Acts 28:16](/acts#Acts.28.16)), and hence his name and sufferings became known in all the praetorium. The “soldiers that kept” him would, on relieving one another on guard, naturally spread the tidings regarding him among their comrades. Some, however, regard the praetroium (q.v.) as the barrack within the palace (the palatium) of the Caesars in Rome where a detachment of these praetorian guards was stationed, or as the camp of the guards placed outside the eastern walls of Rome.

 “In the chambers which were occupied as guard-rooms,” says Dr. Manning, “by the praetorian troops on duty in the palace, a number of rude caricatures are found roughly scratched upon the walls, just such as may be seen upon barrack walls in every part of the world. Amongst these is one of a human figure nailed upon a cross. To add to the ‘offence of the cross,’ the crucified one is represented with the head of an animal, probably that of an ass. Before it stands the figure of a Roman legionary with one hand upraised in the attitude of worship. Underneath is the rude, misspelt, ungrammatical inscription, Alexamenos worships his god. It can scarcely be doubted that we have here a contemporary caricature, executed by one of the praetorian guard, ridiculing the faith of a Christian comrade.”",0.0,unmatched,unmatched,,
Palestine,4742,p-p9.1,Palestine,"Originally denoted only the sea-coast of the land of Canaan inhabited by the Philistines ([Ex. 15:14](/exod#Exod.15.14); [Isa. 14:29](/isa#Isa.14.29), [31](/isa#Isa.14.31); [Joel 3:4](/joel#Joel.3.4)), and in this sense exclusively the Hebrew name Pelesheth (rendered “Philistia” in [Ps. 60:8](/ps#Ps.60.8); [83:7](/ps#Ps.83.7); [87:4](/ps#Ps.87.4); [108:9](/ps#Ps.108.9)) occurs in the Old Testament.

 Not till a late period in Jewish history was this name used to denote “the land of the Hebrews” in general ([Gen. 40:15](/gen#Gen.40.15)). It is also called “the holy land” ([Zech. 2:12](/zech#Zech.2.12)), the “land of Jehovah” ([Hos. 9:3](/hos#Hos.9.3); [Ps. 85:1](/ps#Ps.85.1)), the “land of promise” ([Heb. 11:9](/heb#Heb.11.9)), because promised to Abraham ([Gen. 12:7](/gen#Gen.12.7); [24:7](/gen#Gen.24.7)), the “land of Canaan” ([Gen. 12:5](/gen#Gen.12.5)), the “land of Israel” ([1 Sam. 13:19](/1sam#1Sam.13.19)), and the “land of Judah” ([Isa. 19:17](/isa#Isa.19.17)).

 The territory promised as an inheritance to the seed of Abraham ([Gen. 15:18-21](/gen#Gen.15.18); [Num. 34:1-12](/num#Num.34.1)) was bounded on the east by the river Euphrates, on the west by the Mediterranean, on the north by the “entrance of Hamath,” and on the south by the “river of Egypt.” This extent of territory, about 60,000 square miles, was at length conquered by David, and was ruled over also by his son Solomon ([2 Sam. 8](/2sam#2Sam.8); [1 Chr. 18](/1chr#1Chr.18); [1 Kings 4:1](/1kgs#1Kgs.4.1), [21](/1kgs#1Kgs.4.21)). This vast empire was the Promised Land; but Palestine was only a part of it, terminating in the north at the southern extremity of the Lebanon range, and in the south in the wilderness of Paran, thus extending in all to about 144 miles in length. Its average breadth was about 60 miles from the Mediterranean on the west to beyond the Jordan. It has fittingly been designated “the least of all lands.” Western Palestine, on the south of Gaza, is only about 40 miles in breadth from the Mediterranean to the Dead Sea, narrowing gradually toward the north, where it is only 20 miles from the sea-coast to the Jordan.

 Palestine, “set in the midst” ([Ezek. 5:5](/ezek#Ezek.5.5)) of all other lands, is the most remarkable country on the face of the earth. No single country of such an extent has so great a variety of climate, and hence also of plant and animal life. Moses describes it as “a good land, a land of brooks of water, of fountains and depths that spring out of valleys and hills; a land of wheat, and barley, and vines, and fig trees, and pomegranates; a land of oil olive, and honey; a land wherein thou shalt not eat bread without scarceness, thou shalt not lack any thing in it; a land whose stones are iron, and out of whose hills thou mayest dig brass” ([Deut. 8:7-9](/deut#Deut.8.7)).

 “In the time of Christ the country looked, in all probability, much as now. The whole land consists of rounded limestone hills, fretted into countless stony valleys, offering but rarely level tracts, of which Esdraelon alone, below Nazareth, is large enough to be seen on the map. The original woods had for ages disappeared, though the slopes were dotted, as now, with figs, olives, and other fruit-trees where there was any soil. Permanent streams were even then unknown, the passing rush of winter torrents being all that was seen among the hills. The autumn and spring rains, caught in deep cisterns hewn out like huge underground jars in the soft limestone, with artificial mud-banked ponds still found near all villages, furnished water. Hills now bare, or at best rough with stunted growth, were then terraced, so as to grow vines, olives, and grain. To-day almost desolate, the country then teemed with population. Wine-presses cut in the rocks, endless terraces, and the ruins of old vineyard towers are now found amidst solitudes overgrown for ages with thorns and thistles, or with wild shrubs and poor gnarled scrub” (Geikie’s Life of Christ).

 From an early period the land was inhabited by the descendants of Canaan, who retained possession of the whole land “from Sidon to Gaza” till the time of the conquest by Joshua, when it was occupied by the twelve tribes. Two tribes and a half had their allotments given them by Moses on the east of the Jordan ([Deut. 3:12-20](/deut#Deut.3.12); comp. [Num. 1:17-46](/num#Num.1.17); [Josh. 4:12-13](/josh#Josh.4.12)). The remaining tribes had their portion on the west of Jordan.

 From the conquest till the time of Saul, about four hundred years, the people were governed by judges. For a period of one hundred and twenty years the kingdom retained its unity while it was ruled by Saul and David and Solomon. On the death of Solomon, his son Rehoboam ascended the throne; but his conduct was such that ten of the tribes revolted, and formed an independent monarchy, called the kingdom of Israel, or the northern kingdom, the capital of which was first Shechem and afterwards Samaria. This kingdom was destroyed. The Israelites were carried captive by Shalmanezer, king of Assyria, B.C. 722, after an independent existence of two hundred and fifty-three years. The place of the captives carried away was supplied by tribes brought from the east, and thus was formed the Samaritan nation ([2 Kings 17:24-29](/2kgs#2Kgs.17.24)).

 Nebuchadnezzar came up against the kingdom of the two tribes, the kingdom of Judah, the capital of which was Jerusalem, one hundred and thirty-four years after the overthrow of the kingdom of Israel. He overthrew the city, plundered the temple, and carried the people into captivity to Babylon (B.C. 587), where they remained seventy years. At the close of the period of the Captivity, they returned to their own land, under the edict of Cyrus ([Ezra 1:1-4](/ezra#Ezra.1.1)). They rebuilt the city and temple, and restored the old Jewish commonwealth.

 For a while after the Restoration the Jews were ruled by Zerubbabel, Ezra, and Nehemiah, and afterwards by the high priests, assisted by the Sanhedrin. After the death of Alexander the Great at Babylon (B.C. 323), his vast empire was divided between his four generals. Egypt, Arabia, Palestine, and Coele-Syria fell to the lot of Ptolemy Lagus. Ptolemy took possession of Palestine in B.C. 320, and carried nearly one hundred thousand of the inhabitants of Jerusalem into Egypt. He made Alexandria the capital of his kingdom, and treated the Jews with consideration, confirming them in the enjoyment of many privileges.

 After suffering persecution at the hands of Ptolemy’s successors, the Jews threw off the Egyptian yoke, and became subject to Antiochus the Great, the king of Syria. The cruelty and opression of the successors of Antiochus at length led to the revolt under the Maccabees (B.C. 163), when they threw off the Syrian yoke.

 In the year B.C. 68, Palestine was reduced by Pompey the Great to a Roman province. He laid the walls of the city in ruins, and massacred some twelve thousand of the inhabitants. He left the temple, however, unijured. About twenty-five years after this the Jews revolted and cast off the Roman yoke. They were however, subdued by Herod the Great (q.v.). The city and the temple were destroyed, and many of the inhabitants were put to death. About B.C. 20, Herod proceeded to rebuild the city and restore the ruined temple, which in about nine years and a half was so far completed that the sacred services could be resumed in it (comp. [John 2:20](/john#John.2.20)). He was succeeded by his son Archelaus, who was deprived of his power, however, by Augustus, A.D. 6, when Palestine became a Roman province, ruled by Roman governors or procurators. Pontius Pilate was the fifth of these procurators. He was appointed to his office A.D. 25.

 Exclusive of Idumea, the kingdom of Herod the Great comprehended the whole of the country originally divided among the twelve tribes, which he divided into four provinces or districts. This division was recognized so long as Palestine was under the Roman dominion. These four provinces were, (1) Judea, the southern portion of the country; (2) Samaria, the middle province, the northern boundary of which ran along the hills to the south of the plain of Esdraelon; (3) Galilee, the northern province; and (4) Peraea (a Greek name meaning the “opposite country”), the country lying east of the Jordan and the Dead Sea.

Branches of the palm tree were carried at the feast of Tabernacles ([Lev. 23:40](/lev#Lev.23.40)).

 Instruction by parables has been in use from the earliest times. A large portion of our Lord’s public teaching consisted of parables. He himself explains his reasons for this in his answer to the inquiry of the disciples, “Why speakest thou to them in parables?” ([Matt. 13:13-15](/matt#Matt.13.13); [Mark 4:11](/mark#Mark.4.11), [12](/mark#Mark.4.12); [Luke 8:9](/luke#Luke.8.9), [10](/luke#Luke.8.10)). He followed in so doing the rule of the divine procedures, as recorded in [Matt. 13:13](/matt#Matt.13.13).

 The parables uttered by our Lord are all recorded in the synoptical (i.e., the first three) Gospels.

While Eglon was resting in such a parlour, Ehud, under pretence of having a message from God to him, was admitted into his presence, and murderously plunged his dagger into his body (21, 22).

This name occurs only twice in Scripture.

 In [1 Sam. 26:20](/1sam#1Sam.26.20) “David alludes to the mode of chase practised now, as of old, when the partridge, continuously chased, was at length, when fatigued, knocked down by sticks thrown along the ground.” It endeavours to save itself “by running, in preference to flight, unless when suddenly started. It is not an inhabitant of the plain or the corn-field, but of rocky hill-sides” (Tristram’s Nat. Hist.).

 In [Jer. 17:11](/jer#Jer.17.11) the prophet is illustrating the fact that riches unlawfully acquired are precarious and short-lived. The exact nature of the illustration cannot be precisely determined. Some interpret the words as meaning that the covetous man will be as surely disappointed as the partridge which gathers in eggs, not of her own laying, and is unable to hatch them; others (Tristram), with more probability, as denoting that the man who enriches himself by unjust means “will as surely be disappointed as the partridge which commences to sit, but is speedily robbed of her hopes of a brood” by her eggs being stolen away from her.

Passover,4781,p-p68.2,Passover,"The name given to the chief of the three great historical annual festivals of the Jews. It was kept in remembrance of the Lord’s passing over the houses of the Israelites ([Ex. 12:13](/exod#Exod.12.13)) when the first born of all the Egyptians were destroyed. It is called also the “feast of unleavened bread” ([Ex. 23:15](/exod#Exod.23.15); [Mark 14:1](/mark#Mark.14.1); [Acts 12:3](/acts#Acts.12.3)), because during its celebration no leavened bread was to be eaten or even kept in the household ([Ex. 12:15](/exod#Exod.12.15)). The word afterwards came to denote the lamb that was slain at the feast ([Mark 14:12-14](/mark#Mark.14.12); [1 Cor. 5:7](/1cor#1Cor.5.7)).

 A detailed account of the institution of this feast is given in [Ex. 12](/exod#Exod.12) and 13. It was afterwards incorporated in the ceremonial law ([Lev. 23:4-8](/lev#Lev.23.4)) as one of the great festivals of the nation. In after times many changes seem to have taken place as to the mode of its celebration as compared with its first celebration (comp. [Deut. 16:2](/deut#Deut.16.2), [5](/deut#Deut.16.5), [6](/deut#Deut.16.6); [2 Chr. 30:16](/2chr#2Chr.30.16); [Lev. 23:10-14](/lev#Lev.23.10); [Num. 9:10](/num#Num.9.10), [11](/num#Num.9.11); 28:16-24).

 There is recorded only one celebration of this feast between the Exodus and the entrance into Canaan, namely, that mentioned in [Num. 9:5](/num#Num.9.5). It was primarily a commemorative ordinance, reminding the children of Israel of their deliverance out of Egypt; but it was, no doubt, also a type of the great deliverance wrought by the Messiah for all his people from the doom of death on account of sin, and from the bondage of sin itself, a worse than Egyptian bondage ([1 Cor. 5:7](/1cor#1Cor.5.7); [John 1:29](/john#John.1.29); [19:32-36](/john#John.19.32); [1 Pet. 1:19](/1pet#1Pet.1.19); [Gal. 4:4](/gal#Gal.4.4), [5](/gal#Gal.4.5)). The appearance of Jerusalem on the occasion of the Passover in the time of our Lord is thus fittingly described: “The city itself and the neighbourhood became more and more crowded as the feast approached, the narrow streets and dark arched bazaars showing the same throng of men of all nations as when Jesus had first visited Jerusalem as a boy. Even the temple offered a strange sight at this season, for in parts of the outer courts a wide space was covered with pens for sheep, goats, and cattle to be used for offerings. Sellers shouted the merits of their beasts, sheep bleated, oxen lowed. Sellers of doves also had a place set apart for them.

This name is generally applied to the progenitors of families or “heads of the fathers” ([Josh. 14:1](/josh#Josh.14.1)) mentioned in Scripture, and they are spoken of as antediluvian (from Adam to Noah) and post-diluvian (from Noah to Jacob) patriachs. But the expression “the patriarch,” by way of eminence, is applied to the twelve sons of Jacob, or to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob.

 “Patriachal longevity presents itself as one of the most striking of the facts concerning mankind which the early history of the Book of Genesis places before us...There is a large amount of consentient tradition to the effect that the life of man was originally far more prolonged than it is at present, extending to at least several hundred years. The Babylonians, Egyptians, and Chinese exaggerated these hundreds into thousands. The Greeks and Romans, with more moderation, limited human life within a thousand or eight hundred years. The Hindus still farther shortened the term. Their books taught that in the first age of the world man was free from diseases, and lived ordinarily four hundred years; in the second age the term of life was reduced from four hundred to three hundred; in the third it became two hundred; in the fourth and last it was brought down to one hundred” (Rawlinson’s Historical Illustrations).",0.0,unmatched,unmatched,,

Paul,4788,p-p78.3,Paul,"'=Saul (q.v.) was born about the same time as our Lord. His circumcision-name was Saul, and probably the name Paul was also given to him in infancy “for use in the Gentile world,” as “Saul” would be his Hebrew home-name. He was a native of Tarsus, the capital of Cilicia, a Roman province in the south-east of Asia Minor. That city stood on the banks of the river Cydnus, which was navigable thus far; hence it became a centre of extensive commercial traffic with many countries along the shores of the Mediterranean, as well as with the countries of central Asia Minor. It thus became a city distinguished for the wealth of its inhabitants.

 Tarsus was also the seat of a famous university, higher in reputation even than the universities of Athens and Alexandria, the only others that then existed. Here Saul was born, and here he spent his youth, doubtless enjoying the best education his native city could afford. His father was of the straitest sect of the Jews, a Pharisee, of the tribe of Benjamin, of pure and unmixed Jewish blood ([Acts 23:6](/acts#Acts.23.6); [Phil. 3:5](/phil#Phil.3.5)). We learn nothing regarding his mother; but there is reason to conclude that she was a pious woman, and that, like-minded with her husband, she exercised all a mother influence in moulding the character of her son, so that he could afterwards speak of himself as being, from his youth up, “touching the righteousness which is in the law, blameless” ([Phil. 3:6](/phil#Phil.3.6)).

 We read of his sister and his sister’s son ([Acts 23:16](/acts#Acts.23.16)), and of other relatives ([Rom. 16:7](/rom#Rom.16.7), [11](/rom#Rom.16.11), [12](/rom#Rom.16.12)). Though a Jew, his father was a Roman citizen. How he obtained this privilege we are not informed. “It might be bought, or won by distinguished service to the state, or acquired in several other ways; at all events, his son was freeborn. It was a valuable privilege, and one that was to prove of great use to Paul, although not in the way in which his father might have been expected to desire him to make use of it.” Perhaps the most natural career for the youth to follow was that of a merchant. “But it was decided that...he should go to college and become a rabbi, that is, a minister, a teacher, and a lawyer all in one.”

 According to Jewish custom, however, he learned a trade before entering on the more direct preparation for the sacred profession. The trade he acquired was the making of tents from goats’ hair cloth, a trade which was one of the commonest in Tarsus.

 His preliminary education having been completed, Saul was sent, when about thirteen years of age probably, to the great Jewish school of sacred learning at Jerusalem as a student of the law. Here he became a pupil of the celebrated rabbi Gamaliel, and here he spent many years in an elaborate study of the Scriptures and of the many questions concerning them with which the rabbis exercised themselves. During these years of diligent study he lived “in all good conscience,” unstained by the vices of that great city.

 After the period of his student-life expired, he probably left Jerusalem for Tarsus, where he may have been engaged in connection with some synagogue for some years. But we find him back again at Jerusalem very soon after the death of our Lord. Here he now learned the particulars regarding the crucifixion, and the rise of the new sect of the “Nazarenes.”

 For some two years after Pentecost, Christianity was quietly spreading its influence in Jerusalem. At length Stephen, one of the seven deacons, gave forth more public and aggressive testimony that Jesus was the Messiah, and this led to much excitement among the Jews and much disputation in their synagogues. Persecution arose against Stephen and the followers of Christ generally, in which Saul of Tarsus took a prominent part. He was at this time probably a member of the great Sanhedrin, and became the active leader in the furious persecution by which the rulers then sought to exterminate Christianity.

 But the object of this persecution also failed. “They that were scattered abroad went everywhere preaching the word.” The anger of the persecutor was thereby kindled into a fiercer flame. Hearing that fugitives had taken refuge in Damascus, he obtained from the chief priest letters authorizing him to proceed thither on his persecuting career. This was a long journey of about 130 miles, which would occupy perhaps six days, during which, with his few attendants, he steadily went onward, “breathing out threatenings and slaughter.” But the crisis of his life was at hand. He had reached the last stage of his journey, and was within sight of Damascus. As he and his companions rode on, suddenly at mid-day a brilliant light shone round them, and Saul was laid prostrate in terror on the ground, a voice sounding in his ears, “Saul, Saul, why persecutest thou me?” The risen Saviour was there, clothed in the vesture of his glorified humanity. In answer to the anxious inquiry of the stricken persecutor, “Who art thou, Lord?” he said, “I am Jesus whom thou persecutest” ([Acts 9:5](/acts#Acts.9.5); [22:8](/acts#Acts.22.8); [26:15](/acts#Acts.26.15)).

 This was the moment of his conversion, the most solemn in all his life. Blinded by the dazzling light ([Acts 9:8](/acts#Acts.9.8)), his companions led him into the city, where, absorbed in deep thought for three days, he neither ate nor drank (9:11). Ananias, a disciple living in Damascus, was informed by a vision of the change that had happened to Saul, and was sent to him to open his eyes and admit him by baptism into the Christian church (9:11-16). The whole purpose of his life was now permanently changed.

 Immediately after his conversion he retired into the solitudes of Arabia ([Gal. 1:17](/gal#Gal.1.17)), perhaps of “Sinai in Arabia,” for the purpose, probably, of devout study and meditation on the marvellous revelation that had been made to him. “A veil of thick darkness hangs over this visit to Arabia. Of the scenes among which he moved, of the thoughts and occupations which engaged him while there, of all the circumstances of a crisis which must have shaped the whole tenor of his after-life, absolutely nothing is known. ‘Immediately,’ says St. Paul, ‘I went away into Arabia.’ The historian passes over the incident [comp. [Acts 9:23](/acts#Acts.9.23) and [1 Kings 11:38](/1kgs#1Kgs.11.38), [39](/1kgs#1Kgs.11.39)]. It is a mysterious pause, a moment of suspense, in the apostle’s history, a breathless calm, which ushers in the tumultuous storm of his active missionary life.” Coming back, after three years, to Damascus, he began to preach the gospel “boldly in the name of Jesus” ([Acts 9:27](/acts#Acts.9.27)), but was soon obliged to flee (9:25; [2 Cor. 11:33](/2cor#2Cor.11.33)) from the Jews and betake himself to Jerusalem. Here he tarried for three weeks, but was again forced to flee ([Acts 9:28](/acts#Acts.9.28), [29](/acts#Acts.9.29)) from persecution. He now returned to his native Tarsus ([Gal. 1:21](/gal#Gal.1.21)), where, for probably about three years, we lose sight of him. The time had not yet come for his entering on his great life-work of preaching the gospel to the Gentiles.

 At length the city of Antioch, the capital of Syria, became the scene of great Christian activity. There the gospel gained a firm footing, and the cause of Christ prospered. Barnabas (q.v.), who had been sent from Jerusalem to superintend the work at Antioch, found it too much for him, and remembering Saul, he set out to Tarsus to seek for him. He readily responded to the call thus addressed to him, and came down to Antioch, which for “a whole year” became the scene of his labours, which were crowned with great success. The disciples now, for the first time, were called “Christians” ([Acts 11:26](/acts#Acts.11.26)).

 The church at Antioch now proposed to send out missionaries to the Gentiles, and Saul and Barnabas, with John Mark as their attendant, were chosen for this work. This was a great epoch in the history of the church. Now the disciples began to give effect to the Master’s command: “Go ye into all the world, and preach the gospel to every creature.”

 The three missionaries went forth on the first missionary tour. They sailed from Seleucia, the seaport of Antioch, across to Cyprus, some 80 miles to the south-west. Here at Paphos, Sergius Paulus, the Roman proconsul, was converted, and now Saul took the lead, and was ever afterwards called Paul. The missionaries now crossed to the mainland, and then proceeded 6 or 7 miles up the river Cestrus to Perga ([Acts 13:13](/acts#Acts.13.13)), where John Mark deserted the work and returned to Jerusalem. The two then proceeded about 100 miles inland, passing through Pamphylia, Pisidia, and Lycaonia. The towns mentioned in this tour are the Pisidian Antioch, where Paul delivered his first address of which we have any record (13:16-51; comp. 10:30-43), Iconium, Lystra, and Derbe. They returned by the same route to see and encourage the converts they had made, and ordain elders in every city to watch over the churches which had been gathered. From Perga they sailed direct for Antioch, from which they had set out.

 After remaining “a long time”, probably till A.D. 50 or 51, in Antioch, a great controversy broke out in the church there regarding the relation of the Gentiles to the Mosaic law. For the purpose of obtaining a settlement of this question, Paul and Barnabas were sent as deputies to consult the church at Jerusalem. The council or synod which was there held ([Acts 15](/acts#Acts.15)) decided against the Judaizing party; and the deputies, accompanied by Judas and Silas, returned to Antioch, bringing with them the decree of the council.

 After a short rest at Antioch, Paul said to Barnabas: “Let us go again and visit our brethren in every city where we have preached the word of the Lord, and see how they do.” Mark proposed again to accompany them; but Paul refused to allow him to go. Barnabas was resolved to take Mark, and thus he and Paul had a sharp contention. They separated, and never again met. Paul, however, afterwards speaks with honour of Barnabas, and sends for Mark to come to him at Rome ([Col. 4:10](/col#Col.4.10); [2 Tim. 4:11](/2tim#2Tim.4.11)).

 Paul took with him Silas, instead of Barnabas, and began his second missionary journey about A.D. 51. This time he went by land, revisiting the churches he had already founded in Asia. But he longed to enter into “regions beyond,” and still went forward through Phrygia and Galatia (16:6). Contrary to his intention, he was constrained to linger in Galatia (q.v.), on account of some bodily affliction ([Gal. 4:13](/gal#Gal.4.13), [14](/gal#Gal.4.14)). Bithynia, a populous province on the shore of the Black Sea, lay now before him, and he wished to enter it; but the way was shut, the Spirit in some manner guiding him in another direction, till he came down to the shores of the AEgean and arrived at Troas, on the north-western coast of Asia Minor ([Acts 16:8](/acts#Acts.16.8)). Of this long journey from Antioch to Troas we have no account except some references to it in his Epistle to the Galatians (4:13).

 As he waited at Troas for indications of the will of God as to his future movements, he saw, in the vision of the night, a man from the opposite shores of Macedonia standing before him, and heard him cry, “Come over, and help us” ([Acts 16:9](/acts#Acts.16.9)). Paul recognized in this vision a message from the Lord, and the very next day set sail across the Hellespont, which separated him from Europe, and carried the tidings of the gospel into the Western world. In Macedonia, churches were planted in Philippi, Thessalonica, and Berea. Leaving this province, Paul passed into Achaia, “the paradise of genius and renown.” He reached Athens, but quitted it after, probably, a brief sojourn (17:17-31). The Athenians had received him with cold disdain, and he never visited that city again. He passed over to Corinth, the seat of the Roman government of Achaia, and remained there a year and a half, labouring with much success. While at Corinth, he wrote his two epistles to the church of Thessalonica, his earliest apostolic letters, and then sailed for Syria, that he might be in time to keep the feast of Pentecost at Jerusalem. He was accompanied by Aquila and Priscilla, whom he left at Ephesus, at which he touched, after a voyage of thirteen or fifteen days. He landed at Caesarea, and went up to Jerusalem, and having “saluted the church” there, and kept the feast, he left for Antioch, where he abode “some time” ([Acts 18:20-23](/acts#Acts.18.20)).

 He then began his third missionary tour. He journeyed by land in the “upper coasts” (the more eastern parts) of Asia Minor, and at length made his way to Ephesus, where he tarried for no less than three years, engaged in ceaseless Christian labour. “This city was at the time the Liverpool of the Mediterranean. It possessed a splendid harbour, in which was concentrated the traffic of the sea which was then the highway of the nations; and as Liverpool has behind her the great towns of Lancashire, so had Ephesus behind and around her such cities as those mentioned along with her in the epistles to the churches in the book of Revelation, Smyrna, Pergamos, Thyatira, Sardis, Philadelphia, and Laodicea. It was a city of vast wealth, and it was given over to every kind of pleasure, the fame of its theatres and race-course being world-wide” (Stalker’s Life of St. Paul). Here a “great door and effectual” was opened to the apostle. His fellow-labourers aided him in his work, carrying the gospel to Colosse and Laodicea and other places which they could reach.

 Very shortly before his departure from Ephesus, the apostle wrote his First Epistle to the Corinthians (q.v.). The silversmiths, whose traffic in the little images which they made was in danger (see DEMETRIUS), organized a riot against Paul, and he left the city, and proceeded to Troas ([2 Cor. 2:12](/2cor#2Cor.2.12)), whence after some time he went to meet Titus in Macedonia. Here, in consequence of the report Titus brought from Corinth, he wrote his second epistle to that church. Having spent probably most of the summer and autumn in Macedonia, visiting the churches there, specially the churches of Philippi, Thessalonica, and Berea, probably penetrating into the interior, to the shores of the Adriatic ([Rom. 15:19](/rom#Rom.15.19)), he then came into Greece, where he abode three month, spending probably the greater part of this time in Corinth ([Acts 20:2](/acts#Acts.20.2)). During his stay in this city he wrote his Epistle to the Galatians, and also the great Epistle to the Romans. At the end of the three months he left Achaia for Macedonia, thence crossed into Asia Minor, and touching at Miletus, there addressed the Ephesian presbyters, whom he had sent for to meet him ([Acts 20:17](/acts#Acts.20.17)), and then sailed for Tyre, finally reaching Jerusalem, probably in the spring of A.D. 58.

 While at Jerusalem, at the feast of Pentecost, he was almost murdered by a Jewish mob in the temple. (See  TEMPLE, HEROD’S.)  Rescued from their violence by the Roman commandant, he was conveyed as a prisoner to Caesarea, where, from various causes, he was detained a prisoner for two years in Herod’s praetorium ([Acts 23:35](/acts#Acts.23.35)). “Paul was not kept in close confinement; he had at least the range of the barracks in which he was detained. There we can imagine him pacing the ramparts on the edge of the Mediterranean, and gazing wistfully across the blue waters in the direction of Macedonia, Achaia, and Ephesus, where his spiritual children were pining for him, or perhaps encountering dangers in which they sorely needed his presence. It was a mysterious providence which thus arrested his energies and condemned the ardent worker to inactivity; yet we can now see the reason for it. Paul was needing rest. After twenty years of incessant evangelization, he required leisure to garner the harvest of experience...During these two years he wrote nothing; it was a time of internal mental activity and silent progress” (Stalker’s Life of St. Paul).

 At the end of these two years Felix (q.v.) was succeeded in the governorship of Palestine by Porcius Festus, before whom the apostle was again heard. But judging it right at this crisis to claim the privilege of a Roman citizen, he appealed to the emperor ([Acts 25:11](/acts#Acts.25.11)). Such an appeal could not be disregarded, and Paul was at once sent on to Rome under the charge of one Julius, a centurion of the “Augustan cohort.” After a long and perilous voyage, he at length reached the imperial city in the early spring, probably, of A.D. 61. Here he was permitted to occupy his own hired house, under constant military custody. This privilege was accorded to him, no doubt, because he was a Roman citizen, and as such could not be put into prison without a trial. The soldiers who kept guard over Paul were of course changed at frequent intervals, and thus he had the opportunity of preaching the gospel to many of them during these “two whole years,” and with the blessed result of spreading among the imperial guards, and even in Caesar’s household, an interest in the truth ([Phil. 1:13](/phil#Phil.1.13)). His rooms were resorted to by many anxious inquirers, both Jews and Gentiles ([Acts 28:23](/acts#Acts.28.23), [30](/acts#Acts.28.30), [31](/acts#Acts.28.31)), and thus his imprisonment “turned rather to the furtherance of the gospel,” and his “hired house” became the centre of a gracious influence which spread over the whole city. According to a Jewish tradition, it was situated on the borders of the modern Ghetto, which has been the Jewish quarters in Rome from the time of Pompey to the present day. During this period the apostle wrote his epistles to the Colossians, Ephesians, Philippians, and to Philemon, and probably also to the Hebrews.

 This first imprisonment came at length to a close, Paul having been acquitted, probably because no witnesses appeared against him. Once more he set out on his missionary labours, probably visiting western and eastern Europe and Asia Minor. During this period of freedom he wrote his First Epistle to Timothy and his Epistle to Titus. The year of his release was signalized by the burning of Rome, which Nero saw fit to attribute to the Christians. A fierce persecution now broke out against the Christians. Paul was siezed, and once more conveyed to Rome a prisoner. During this imprisonment he probably wrote the Second Epistle to Timothy, the last he ever wrote. “There can be little doubt that he appered again at Nero’s bar, and this time the charge did not break down. In all history there is not a more startling illustration of the irony of human life than this scene of Paul at the bar of Nero. On the judgment-seat, clad in the imperial purple, sat a man who, in a bad world, had attained the eminence of being the very worst and meanest being in it, a man stained with every crime, a man whose whole being was so steeped in every nameable and unnameable vice, that body and soul of him were, as some one said at the time, nothing but a compound of mud and blood; and in the prisoner’s dock stood the best man the world possessed, his hair whitened with labours for the good of men and the glory of God. The trial ended: Paul was condemned, and delivered over to the executioner. He was led out of the city, with a crowd of the lowest rabble at his heels. The fatal spot was reached; he knelt beside the block; the headsman’s axe gleamed in the sun and fell; and the head of the apostle of the world rolled down in the dust” (probably A.D. 66), four years before the fall of Jerusalem.",0.0,person,paul_2479,paul_2479,

Pentateuch,4826,p-p132.9,Pentateuch,"The five-fold volume, consisting of the first five books of the Old Testament. This word does not occur in Scripture, nor is it certainly known when the roll was thus divided into five portions Genesis, Exodus, Leviticus, Numbers, Deuteronomy. Probably that was done by the LXX. translators. Some modern critics speak of a Hexateuch, introducing the Book of Joshua as one of the group. But this book is of an entirely different character from the other books, and has a different author. It stands by itself as the first of a series of historical books beginning with the entrance of the Israelites into Canaan.

 The books composing the Pentateuch are properly but one book, the “Law of Moses,” the “Book of the Law of Moses,” the “Book of Moses,” or, as the Jews designate it, the “Torah” or “Law.” That in its present form it “proceeds from a single author is proved by its plan and aim, according to which its whole contents refer to the covenant concluded between Jehovah and his people, by the instrumentality of Moses, in such a way that everything before his time is perceived to be preparatory to this fact, and all the rest to be the development of it. Nevertheless, this unity has not been stamped upon it as a matter of necessity by the latest redactor: it has been there from the beginning, and is visible in the first plan and in the whole execution of the work.”, Keil, Einl. i.d. A. T.

 A certain school of critics have set themselves to reconstruct the books of the Old Testament. By a process of “scientific study” they have discovered that the so-called historical books of the Old Testament are not history at all, but a miscellaneous collection of stories, the inventions of many different writers, patched together by a variety of editors! As regards the Pentateuch, they are not ashamed to attribute fraud, and even conspiracy, to its authors, who sought to find acceptance to their work which was composed partly in the age of Josiah, and partly in that of Ezra and Nehemiah, by giving it out to be the work of Moses! This is not the place to enter into the details of this controversy. We may say frankly, however, that we have no faith in this “higher criticism.” It degrades the books of the Old Testament below the level of fallible human writings, and the arguments on which its speculations are built are altogether untenable.

 The evidences in favour of the Mosaic authorship of the Pentateuch are conclusive. We may thus state some of them briefly:",0.0,unmatched,unmatched,,

Pentateuch 4,4830,p-p132.9,Pentateuch,"From the time of Joshua down to the time of Ezra there is, in the intermediate historical books, a constant reference to the Pentateuch as the “Book of the Law of Moses.” This is a point of much importance, inasmuch as the critics deny that there is any such reference; and hence they deny the historical character of the Pentateuch. As regards the Passover, e.g., we find it frequently spoken of or alluded to in the historical books following the Pentateuch, showing that the “Law of Moses” was then certainly known. It was celebrated in the time of Joshua ([Josh. 5:10](/josh#Josh.5.10), cf. 4:19), Hezekiah ([2 Chr. 30](/2chr#2Chr.30)), Josiah ([2 Kings 23](/2kgs#2Kgs.23); [2 Chr. 35](/2chr#2Chr.35)), and Zerubbabel ([Ezra 6:19-22](/ezra#Ezra.6.19)), and is referred to in such passages as [2 Kings 23:22](/2kgs#2Kgs.23.22); [2 Chr. 35:18](/2chr#2Chr.35.18); [1 Kings 9:25](/1kgs#1Kgs.9.25) (“three times in a year”); [2 Chr. 8:13](/2chr#2Chr.8.13). Similarly we might show frequent references to the Feast of Tabernacles and other Jewish institutions, although we do not admit that any valid argument can be drawn from the silence of Scripture in such a case. An examination of the following texts, [1 Kings 2:9](/1kgs#1Kgs.2.9); [2 Kings 14:6](/2kgs#2Kgs.14.6); [2 Chr. 23:18](/2chr#2Chr.23.18); [25:4](/2chr#2Chr.25.4); [34:14](/2chr#2Chr.34.14); [Ezra 3:2](/ezra#Ezra.3.2); [7:6](/ezra#Ezra.7.6); [Dan. 9:11](/dan#Dan.9.11), [13](/dan#Dan.9.13), will also plainly show that the “Law of Moses” was known during all these centuries.

 Granting that in the time of Moses there existed certain oral traditions or written records and documents which he was divinely led to make use of in his history, and that his writing was revised by inspired successors, this will fully account for certain peculiarities of expression which critics have called “anachronisms” and “contradictions,” but in no way militates against the doctrine that Moses was the original author of the whole of the Pentateuch. It is not necessary for us to affirm that the whole is an original composition; but we affirm that the evidences clearly demonstrate that Moses was the author of those books which have come down to us bearing his name.

Its distinguishing feature was the offering of “two leavened loaves” made from the new corn of the completed harvest, which, with two lambs, were waved before the Lord as a thank offering.

It, moreover, follows from a consideration of (1) the immutability of the divine decrees ([Jer. 31:3](/jer#Jer.31.3); [Matt. 24:22-24](/matt#Matt.24.22); [Acts 13:48](/acts#Acts.13.48); [Rom. 8:30](/rom#Rom.8.30)); (2) the provisions of the covenant of grace ([Jer. 32:40](/jer#Jer.32.40); [John 10:29](/john#John.10.29); [17:2-6](/john#John.17.2)); (3) the atonement and intercession of Christ ([Isa. 53:6](/isa#Isa.53.6), [11](/isa#Isa.53.11); [Matt. 20:28](/matt#Matt.20.28); [1 Pet. 2:24](/1pet#1Pet.2.24); [John 11:42](/john#John.11.42); [17:11](/john#John.17.11), [15](/john#John.17.15), [20](/john#John.17.20); [Rom. 8:34](/rom#Rom.8.34)); and (4) the indwelling of the Holy Ghost ([John 14:16](/john#John.14.16); [2 Cor. 1:21](/2cor#2Cor.1.21), [22](/2cor#2Cor.1.22); 5:5; [Eph. 1:14](/eph#Eph.1.14); [1 John 3:9](/1john#1John.3.9)).

One of their chiefs, Teispes, conquered Elam in the time of the decay of the Assyrian Empire, and established himself in the district of Anzan. His descendants branched off into two lines, one line ruling in Anzan, while the other remained in Persia. Cyrus II., king of Anzan, finally united the divided power, conquered Media, Lydia, and Babylonia, and carried his arms into the far East.

Peter,4851,p-p166.3,Peter,"Originally called Simon (=Simeon, i.e., “hearing”), a very common Jewish name in the New Testament. He was the son of Jona ([Matt. 16:17](/matt#Matt.16.17)). His mother is nowhere named in Scripture. He had a younger brother called Andrew, who first brought him to Jesus ([John 1:40-42](/john#John.1.40)). His native town was Bethsaida, on the western coast of the Sea of Galilee, to which also Philip belonged. Here he was brought up by the shores of the Sea of Galilee, and was trained to the occupation of a fisher. His father had probably died while he was still young, and he and his brother were brought up under the care of Zebedee and his wife Salome ([Matt. 27:56](/matt#Matt.27.56); [Mark 15:40](/mark#Mark.15.40); [16:1](/mark#Mark.16.1)). There the four youths, Simon, Andrew, James, and John, spent their boyhood and early manhood in constant fellowship. Simon and his brother doubtless enjoyed all the advantages of a religious training, and were early instructed in an acquaintance with the Scriptures and with the great prophecies regarding the coming of the Messiah. They did not probably enjoy, however, any special training in the study of the law under any of the rabbis. When Peter appeared before the Sanhedrin, he looked like an “unlearned man” ([Acts 4:13](/acts#Acts.4.13)).

 “Simon was a Galilean, and he was that out and out...The Galileans had a marked character of their own. They had a reputation for an independence and energy which often ran out into turbulence. They were at the same time of a franker and more transparent disposition than their brethren in the south. In all these respects, in bluntness, impetuosity, headiness, and simplicity, Simon was a genuine Galilean. They spoke a peculiar dialect. They had a difficulty with the guttural sounds and some others, and their pronunciation was reckoned harsh in Judea. The Galilean accent stuck to Simon all through his career. It betrayed him as a follower of Christ when he stood within the judgment-hall ([Mark 14:70](/mark#Mark.14.70)). It betrayed his own nationality and that of those conjoined with him on the day of Pentecost ([Acts 2:7](/acts#Acts.2.7)).” It would seem that Simon was married before he became an apostle. His wife’s mother is referred to ([Matt. 8:14](/matt#Matt.8.14); [Mark 1:30](/mark#Mark.1.30); [Luke 4:38](/luke#Luke.4.38)). He was in all probability accompanied by his wife on his missionary journeys ([1 Cor. 9:5](/1cor#1Cor.9.5); comp. [1 Pet. 5:13](/1pet#1Pet.5.13)).

 He appears to have been settled at Capernaum when Christ entered on his public ministry, and may have reached beyond the age of thirty. His house was large enough to give a home to his brother Andrew, his wife’s mother, and also to Christ, who seems to have lived with him ([Mark 1:29](/mark#Mark.1.29), [36](/mark#Mark.1.36); 2:1), as well as to his own family. It was apparently two stories high (2:4).

 At Bethabara (R.V., [John 1:28](/john#John.1.28), “Bethany”), beyond Jordan, John the Baptist had borne testimony concerning Jesus as the “Lamb of God” ([John 1:29-36](/john#John.1.29)). Andrew and John hearing it, followed Jesus, and abode with him where he was. They were convinced, by his gracious words and by the authority with which he spoke, that he was the Messiah ([Luke 4:22](/luke#Luke.4.22); [Matt. 7:29](/matt#Matt.7.29)); and Andrew went forth and found Simon and brought him to Jesus ([John 1:41](/john#John.1.41)).

 Jesus at once recognized Simon, and declared that hereafter he would be called Cephas, an Aramaic name corresponding to the Greek Petros, which means “a mass of rock detached from the living rock.” The Aramaic name does not occur again, but the name Peter gradually displaces the old name Simon, though our Lord himself always uses the name Simon when addressing him ([Matt. 17:25](/matt#Matt.17.25); [Mark 14:37](/mark#Mark.14.37); [Luke 22:31](/luke#Luke.22.31), comp. 21:15-17). We are not told what impression the first interview with Jesus produced on the mind of Simon. When we next meet him it is by the Sea of Galilee ([Matt. 4:18-22](/matt#Matt.4.18)). There the four (Simon and Andrew, James and John) had had an unsuccessful night’s fishing. Jesus appeared suddenly, and entering into Simon’s boat, bade him launch forth and let down the nets. He did so, and enclosed a great multitude of fishes. This was plainly a miracle wrought before Simon’s eyes. The awe-stricken disciple cast himself at the feet of Jesus, crying, “Depart from me; for I am a sinful man, O Lord” ([Luke 5:8](/luke#Luke.5.8)). Jesus addressed him with the assuring words, “Fear not,” and announced to him his life’s work. Simon responded at once to the call to become a disciple, and after this we find him in constant attendance on our Lord.

 He is next called into the rank of the apostleship, and becomes a “fisher of men” ([Matt. 4:19](/matt#Matt.4.19)) in the stormy seas of the world of human life ([Matt. 10:2-4](/matt#Matt.10.2); [Mark 3:13-19](/mark#Mark.3.13); [Luke 6:13-16](/luke#Luke.6.13)), and takes a more and more prominent part in all the leading events of our Lord’s life. It is he who utters that notable profession of faith at Capernaum ([John 6:66-69](/john#John.6.66)), and again at Caesarea Philippi ([Matt. 16:13-20](/matt#Matt.16.13); [Mark 8:27-30](/mark#Mark.8.27); [Luke 9:18-20](/luke#Luke.9.18)). This profession at Caesarea was one of supreme importance, and our Lord in response used these memorable words: “Thou art Peter, and upon this rock I will build my church.”

 “From that time forth” Jesus began to speak of his sufferings. For this Peter rebuked him. But our Lord in return rebuked Peter, speaking to him in sterner words than he ever used to any other of his disciples ([Matt. 16:21-23](/matt#Matt.16.21); [Mark 8:31-33](/mark#Mark.8.31)). At the close of his brief sojourn at Caesarea our Lord took Peter and James and John with him into “an high mountain apart,” and was transfigured before them. Peter on that occasion, under the impression the scene produced on his mind, exclaimed, “Lord, it is good for us to be here: let us make three tabernacles” ([Matt. 17:1-9](/matt#Matt.17.1)).

 On his return to Capernaum the collectors of the temple tax (a didrachma, half a sacred shekel), which every Israelite of twenty years old and upwards had to pay ([Ex. 30:15](/exod#Exod.30.15)), came to Peter and reminded him that Jesus had not paid it ([Matt. 17:24-27](/matt#Matt.17.24)). Our Lord instructed Peter to go and catch a fish in the lake and take from its mouth the exact amount needed for the tax, viz., a stater, or two half-shekels. “That take,” said our Lord, “and give unto them for me and thee.”

 As the end was drawing nigh, our Lord sent Peter and John ([Luke 22:7-13](/luke#Luke.22.7)) into the city to prepare a place where he should keep the feast with his disciples. There he was forewarned of the fearful sin into which he afterwards fell (22:31-34). He accompanied our Lord from the guest-chamber to the garden of Gethsemane ([Luke 22:39-46](/luke#Luke.22.39)), which he and the other two who had been witnesses of the transfiguration were permitted to enter with our Lord, while the rest were left without. Here he passed through a strange experience. Under a sudden impulse he cut off the ear of Malchus (47-51), one of the band that had come forth to take Jesus. Then follow the scenes of the judgment-hall (54-61) and his bitter grief (62).

 He is found in John’s company early on the morning of the resurrection. He boldly entered into the empty grave ([John 20:1-10](/john#John.20.1)), and saw the “linen clothes laid by themselves” ([Luke 24:9-12](/luke#Luke.24.9)). To him, the first of the apostles, our risen Lord revealed himself, thus conferring on him a signal honour, and showing how fully he was restored to his favour ([Luke 24:34](/luke#Luke.24.34); [1 Cor. 15:5](/1cor#1Cor.15.5)). We next read of our Lord’s singular interview with Peter on the shores of the Sea of Galilee, where he thrice asked him, “Simon, son of Jonas, lovest thou me?” ([John 21:1-19](/john#John.21.1)).

 After this scene at the lake we hear nothing of Peter till he again appears with the others at the ascension ([Acts 1:15-26](/acts#Acts.1.15)). It was he who proposed that the vacancy caused by the apostasy of Judas should be filled up. He is prominent on the day of Pentecost (2:14-40). The events of that day “completed the change in Peter himself which the painful discipline of his fall and all the lengthened process of previous training had been slowly making. He is now no more the unreliable, changeful, self-confident man, ever swaying between rash courage and weak timidity, but the stead-fast, trusted guide and director of the fellowship of believers, the intrepid preacher of Christ in Jerusalem and abroad. And now that he is become Cephas indeed, we hear almost nothing of the name Simon (only in [Acts 10:5](/acts#Acts.10.5), [32](/acts#Acts.10.32); 15:14), and he is known to us finally as Peter.”

 After the miracle at the temple gate ([Acts 3](/acts#Acts.3)) persecution arose against the Christians, and Peter was cast into prison. He boldly defended himself and his companions at the bar of the council (4:19, 20). A fresh outburst of violence against the Christians (5:17-21) led to the whole body of the apostles being cast into prison; but during the night they were wonderfully delivered, and were found in the morning teaching in the temple. A second time Peter defended them before the council ([Acts 5:29-32](/acts#Acts.5.29)), who, “when they had called the apostles and beaten them, let them go.”

 The time had come for Peter to leave Jerusalem. After labouring for some time in Samaria, he returned to Jerusalem, and reported to the church there the results of his work ([Acts 8:14-25](/acts#Acts.8.14)). Here he remained for a period, during which he met Paul for the first time since his conversion (9:26-30; [Gal. 1:18](/gal#Gal.1.18)). Leaving Jerusalem again, he went forth on a missionary journey to Lydda and Joppa ([Acts 9:32-43](/acts#Acts.9.32)). He is next called on to open the door of the Christian church to the Gentiles by the admission of Cornelius of Caesarea (ch. 10).

 After remaining for some time at Caesarea, he returned to Jerusalem ([Acts 11:1-18](/acts#Acts.11.1)), where he defended his conduct with reference to the Gentiles. Next we hear of his being cast into prison by Herod Agrippa (12:1-19); but in the night an angel of the Lord opened the prison gates, and he went forth and found refuge in the house of Mary.

 He took part in the deliberations of the council in Jerusalem ([Acts 15:1-31](/acts#Acts.15.1); [Gal. 2:1-10](/gal#Gal.2.1)) regarding the relation of the Gentiles to the church. This subject had awakened new interest at Antioch, and for its settlement was referred to the council of the apostles and elders at Jerusalem. Here Paul and Peter met again.

 We have no further mention of Peter in the Acts of the Apostles. He seems to have gone down to Antioch after the council at Jerusalem, and there to have been guilty of dissembling, for which he was severely reprimanded by Paul ([Gal. 2:11-16](/gal#Gal.2.11)), who “rebuked him to his face.”

 After this he appears to have carried the gospel to the east, and to have laboured for a while at Babylon, on the Euphrates ([1 Pet. 5:13](/1pet#1Pet.5.13)). There is no satisfactory evidence that he was ever at Rome. Where or when he died is not certainly known. Probably he died between A.D. 64 and 67.",0.0,person,peter_2745,peter_2745,

It has been noticed that in the beginning of his epistle Peter names the provinces of Asia Minor in the order in which they would naturally occur to one writing from Babylon. He counsels (1) to steadfastness and perseverance under persecution (1-2:10); (2) to the practical duties of a holy life (2:11-3:13); (3) he adduces the example of Christ and other motives to patience and holiness (3:14-4:19); and (4) concludes with counsels to pastors and people (ch. 5).",0.0,unmatched,unmatched,,
"Peter, Second Epistle of",4853,p-p186.1,"Peter, Second Epistle of","The question of the authenticity of this epistle has been much discussed, but the weight of evidence is wholly in favour of its claim to be the production of the apostle whose name it bears. It appears to have been written shortly before the apostle’s death (1:14). This epistle contains eleven references to the Old Testament. It also contains (3:15, 16) a remarkable reference to Paul’s epistles. Some think this reference is to [1 Thess. 4:13-5:11](/1thess#1Thess.4.13).

Origen (obiit A.D. 254), Eusebius (obiit 340), and Jerome (obiit 420) refer to such a work, and hence it has been concluded that it was probably written about the middle of the second century. It professes to give a history of our Lord’s resurrection and ascension. While differing in not a few particulars from the canonical Gospels, the writer shows plainly that he was acquinted both with the synoptics and with the Gospel of John.

Pharaoh 2,4869,p-p196.2,Pharaoh,"The Pharaoh of Joseph’s days ([Gen. 41](/gen#Gen.41)) was probably Apopi, or Apopis, the last of the Hyksos kings. To the old native Egyptians, who were an African race, shepherds were “an abomination;” but to the Hyksos kings these Asiatic shepherds who now appeared with Jacob at their head were congenial, and being akin to their own race, had a warm welcome ([Gen. 47:5](/gen#Gen.47.5), [6](/gen#Gen.47.6)). Some argue that Joseph came to Egypt in the reign of Thothmes III., long after the expulsion of the Hyksos, and that his influence is to be seen in the rise and progress of the religious revolution in the direction of monotheism which characterized the middle of the Eighteenth Dynasty. The wife of Amenophis III., of that dynasty, was a Semite. Is this singular fact to be explained from the presence of some of Joseph’s kindred at the Egyptian court? Pharaoh said to Joseph, “Thy father and thy brethren are come unto thee: the land of Egypt is before thee; in the best of the land make thy father and brethren to dwell” ([Gen. 47:5](/gen#Gen.47.5), [6](/gen#Gen.47.6)).",2.0,unmatched,unmatched,pharaoh_2329,
Pharaoh 3,4870,p-p196.2,Pharaoh,"The “new king who knew not Joseph” ([Ex. 1:8-22](/exod#Exod.1.8)) has been generally supposed to have been Aahmes I., or Amosis, as he is called by Josephus. Recent discoveries, however, have led to the conclusion that Seti was the “new king.”

 For about seventy years the Hebrews in Egypt were under the powerful protection of Joseph. After his death their condition was probably very slowly and gradually changed. The invaders, the Hyksos, who for some five centuries had been masters of Egypt, were driven out, and the old dynasty restored. The Israelites now began to be looked down upon. They began to be afflicted and tyrannized over. In process of time a change appears to have taken place in the government of Egypt. A new dynasty, the Nineteenth, as it is called, came into power under Seti I., who was its founder. He associated with him in his government his son, Rameses II., when he was yet young, probably ten or twelve years of age.

 Note, Professor Maspero, keeper of the museum of Bulak, near Cairo, had his attention in 1870 directed to the fact that scarabs, i.e., stone and metal imitations of the beetle (symbols of immortality), originally worn as amulets by royal personages, which were evidently genuine relics of the time of the ancient Pharaohs, were being sold at Thebes and different places along the Nile. This led him to suspect that some hitherto undiscovered burial-place of the Pharaohs had been opened, and that these and other relics, now secretly sold, were a part of the treasure found there. For a long time he failed, with all his ingenuity, to find the source of these rare treasures. At length one of those in the secret volunteered to give information regarding this burial-place. The result was that a party was conducted in 1881 to Dier el-Bahari, near Thebes, when the wonderful discovery was made of thirty-six mummies of kings, queens, princes, and high priests hidden away in a cavern prepared for them, where they had lain undisturbed for thirty centuries. “The temple of Deir el-Bahari stands in the middle of a natural amphitheatre of cliffs, which is only one of a number of smaller amphitheatres into which the limestone mountains of the tombs are broken up. In the wall of rock separating this basin from the one next to it some ancient Egyptian engineers had constructed the hiding-place, whose secret had been kept for nearly three thousand years.” The exploring party being guided to the place, found behind a great rock a shaft 6 feet square and about 40 feet deep, sunk into the limestone. At the bottom of this a passage led westward for 25 feet, and then turned sharply northward into the very heart of the mountain, where in a chamber 23 feet by 13, and 6 feet in height, they came upon the wonderful treasures of antiquity. The mummies were all carefully secured and brought down to Bulak, where they were deposited in the royal museum, which has now been removed to Ghizeh.

 Among the most notable of the ancient kings of Egypt thus discovered were Thothmes III., Seti I., and Rameses II. Thothmes III. was the most distinguished monarch of the brilliant Eighteenth Dynasty. When this mummy was unwound “once more, after an interval of thirty-six centuries, human eyes gazed on the features of the man who had conquered Syria and Cyprus and Ethiopia, and had raised Egypt to the highest pinnacle of her power. The spectacle, however, was of brief duration. The remains proved to be in so fragile a state that there was only time to take a hasty photograph, and then the features crumbled to pieces and vanished like an apparition, and so passed away from human view for ever.” “It seems strange that though the body of this man,” who overran Palestine with his armies two hundred years before the birth of Moses, “mouldered to dust, the flowers with which it had been wreathed were so wonderfully preserved that even their colour could be distinguished” (Manning’s Land of the Pharaohs).

 Seti I. (his throne name Merenptah), the father of Rameses II., was a great and successful warrior, also a great builder. The mummy of this Pharaoh, when unrolled, brought to view “the most beautiful mummy head ever seen within the walls of the museum. The sculptors of Thebes and Abydos did not flatter this Pharaoh when they gave him that delicate, sweet, and smiling profile which is the admiration of travellers. After a lapse of thirty-two centuries, the mummy retains the same expression which characterized the features of the living man. Most remarkable of all, when compared with the mummy of Rameses II., is the striking resemblance between the father and the son. Seti I. is, as it were, the idealized type of Rameses II. He must have died at an advanced age. The head is shaven, the eyebrows are white, the condition of the body points to considerably more than threescore years of life, thus confirming the opinions of the learned, who have attributed a long reign to this king.”",3.0,person,pharaoh_2330,pharaoh_2330,

During his sojourn in Midian, however, Rameses died, after a reign of sixty-seven years, and his body embalmed and laid in the royal sepulchre in the Valley of the Tombs of Kings beside that of his father. Like the other mummies found hidden in the cave of Deir el-Bahari, it had been for some reason removed from its original tomb, and probably carried from place to place till finally deposited in the cave where it was so recently discovered.

 In 1886, the mummy of this king, the “great Rameses,” the “Sesostris” of the Greeks, was unwound, and showed the body of what must have been a robust old man. The features revealed to view are thus described by Maspero: “The head is long and small in proportion to the body. The top of the skull is quite bare. On the temple there are a few sparse hairs, but at the poll the hair is quite thick, forming smooth, straight locks about two inches in length. White at the time of death, they have been dyed a light yellow by the spices used in embalmment. The forehead is low and narrow; the brow-ridge prominent; the eye-brows are thick and white; the eyes are small and close together; the nose is long, thin, arched like the noses of the Bourbons; the temples are sunk; the cheek-bones very prominent; the ears round, standing far out from the head, and pierced, like those of a woman, for the wearing of earrings; the jaw-bone is massive and strong; the chin very prominent; the mouth small, but thick-lipped; the teeth worn and very brittle, but white and well preserved. The moustache and beard are thin. They seem to have been kept shaven during life, but were probably allowed to grow during the king’s last illness, or they may have grown after death. The hairs are white, like those of the head and eyebrows, but are harsh and bristly, and a tenth of an inch in length. The skin is of an earthy-brown, streaked with black. Finally, it may be said, the face of the mummy gives a fair idea of the face of the living king. The expression is unintellectual, perhaps slightly animal; but even under the somewhat grotesque disguise of mummification there is plainly to be seen an air of sovereign majesty, of resolve, and of pride.”

 Both on his father’s and his mother’s side it has been pretty clearly shown that Rameses had Chaldean or Mesopotamian blood in his veins to such a degree that he might be called an Assyrian. This fact is thought to throw light on [Isa. 52:4](/isa#Isa.52.4).",4.0,unmatched,unmatched,,
Pharaoh 5,4872,p-p196.2,Pharaoh,"The Pharaoh of the Exodus was probably Menephtah I., the fourteenth and eldest surviving son of Rameses II. He resided at Zoan, where he had the various interviews with Moses and Aaron recorded in the book of Exodus. His mummy was not among those found at Deir el-Bahari. It is still a question, however, whether Seti II. or his father Menephtah was the Pharaoh of the Exodus. Some think the balance of evidence to be in favour of the former, whose reign it is known began peacefully, but came to a sudden and disastrous end. The “Harris papyrus,” found at Medinet-Abou in Upper Egypt in 1856, a state document written by Rameses III., the second king of the Twentieth Dynasty, gives at length an account of a great exodus from Egypt, followed by wide-spread confusion and anarchy. This, there is great reason to believe, was the Hebrew exodus, with which the Nineteenth Dynasty of the Pharaohs came to an end. This period of anarchy was brought to a close by Setnekht, the founder of the Twentieth Dynasty.

 “In the spring of 1896, Professor Flinders Petrie discovered, among the ruins of the temple of Menephtah at Thebes, a large granite stela, on which is engraved a hymn of victory commemorating the defeat of Libyan invaders who had overrun the Delta. At the end other victories of Menephtah are glanced at, and it is said that ‘the Israelites (I-s-y-r-a-e-l-u) are minished (?) so that they have no seed.’ Menephtah was son and successor of Rameses II., the builder of Pithom, and Egyptian scholars have long seen in him the Pharaoh of the Exodus. The Exodus is also placed in his reign by the Egyptian legend of the event preserved by the historian Manetho. In the inscription the name of the Israelites has no determinative of ‘country’ or ’district’ attached to it, as is the case with all the other names (Canaan, Ashkelon, Gezer, Khar or Southern Palestine, etc.) mentioned along with it, and it would therefore appear that at the time the hymn was composed, the Israelites had already been lost to the sight of the Egyptians in the desert. At all events they must have had as yet no fixed home or district of their own. We may therefore see in the reference to them the Pharaoh’s version of the Exodus, the disasters which befell the Egyptians being naturally passed over in silence, and only the destruction of the ‘men children’ of the Israelites being recorded. The statement of the Egyptian poet is a remarkable parallel to [Ex. 1:10-22](/exod#Exod.1.10).”",5.0,person,pharaoh_2330,pharaoh_2331,

They were probably the successors of the Assideans (i.e., the “pious”), a party that originated in the time of Antiochus Epiphanes in revolt against his heathenizing policy. The first mention of them is in a description by Josephus of the three sects or schools into which the Jews were divided (B.C. 145). The other two sects were the Essenes and the Sadducees. In the time of our Lord they were the popular party ([John 7:48](/john#John.7.48)). They were extremely accurate and minute in all matters appertaining to the law of Moses ([Matt. 9:14](/matt#Matt.9.14); [23:15](/matt#Matt.23.15); [Luke 11:39](/luke#Luke.11.39); [18:12](/luke#Luke.18.12)). Paul, when brought before the council of Jerusalem, professed himself a Pharisee ([Acts 23:6-8](/acts#Acts.23.6); [26:4](/acts#Acts.26.4), [5](/acts#Acts.26.5)).

 There was much that was sound in their creed, yet their system of religion was a form and nothing more. Theirs was a very lax morality ([Matt. 5:20](/matt#Matt.5.20); [15:4](/matt#Matt.15.4), [8](/matt#Matt.15.8); [23:3](/matt#Matt.23.3), [14](/matt#Matt.23.14), [23](/matt#Matt.23.23), [25](/matt#Matt.23.25); [John 8:7](/john#John.8.7)). On the first notice of them in the New Testament ([Matt. 3:7](/matt#Matt.3.7)), they are ranked by our Lord with the Sadducees as a “generation of vipers.” They were noted for their self-righteousness and their pride ([Matt. 9:11](/matt#Matt.9.11); [Luke 7:39](/luke#Luke.7.39); [18:11](/luke#Luke.18.11), [12](/luke#Luke.18.12)).

Phenicia,4889,p-p226.2,Phenicia,"([Acts 21:2](/acts#Acts.21.2)) = Phenice (11:19; 15:3; R.V., Phoenicia), Gr. phoinix, “a palm”, the land of palm-trees; a strip of land of an average breadth of about 20 miles along the shores of the Mediterranean, from the river Eleutherus in the north to the promotory of Carmel in the south, about 120 miles in length. This name is not found in the Old Testament, and in the New Testament it is mentioned only in the passages above referred to.

 “In the Egyptian inscriptions Phoenicia is called Keft, the inhabitants being Kefa; and since Keft-ur, or ‘Greater Phoenicia,’ was the name given to the delta of the Nile from the Phoenician colonies settled upon it, the Philistines who came from Caphtor or Keft-ur must have been of Phoenician origin” (comp. [Deut. 2:23](/deut#Deut.2.23); [Jer. 47:4](/jer#Jer.47.4); [Amos 9:7](/amos#Amos.9.7))., Sayce’s Bible and the Monuments.

 Phoenicia lay in the very centre of the old world, and was the natural entrepot for commerce with foreign nations. It was the “England of antiquity.” “The trade routes from all Asia converged on the Phoenician coast; the centres of commerce on the Euphrates and Tigris forwarding their goods by way of Tyre to the Nile, to Arabia, and to the west; and, on the other hand, the productions of the vast regions bordering the Mediterranean passing through the Canaanite capital to the eastern world.” It was “situate at the entry of the sea, a merchant of the people for many isles” ([Ezek. 27:3](/ezek#Ezek.27.3), [4](/ezek#Ezek.27.4)). The far-reaching commercial activity of the Phoenicians, especially with Tarshish and the western world, enriched them with vast wealth, which introduced boundless luxury and developed among them a great activity in all manner of arts and manufactures.

 The Phoenicians were the most enterprising merchants of the old world, establishing colonies at various places, of which Carthage was the chief. They were a Canaanite branch of the race of Ham, and are frequently called Sidonians, from their principal city of Sidon. None could “skill to hew timber like unto the Sidonians” ([1 Kings 5:6](/1kgs#1Kgs.5.6)). King Hiram rendered important service to Solomon in connection with the planning and building of the temple, casting for him all the vessels for the temple service, and the two pillars which stood in the front of the porch, and “the molten sea” ([1 Kings 7:21-23](/1kgs#1Kgs.7.21)). Singular marks have been found by recent exploration on the great stones that form the substructure of the temple. These marks, both painted and engraved, have been regarded as made by the workmen in the quarries, and as probably intended to indicate the place of these stones in the building. “The Biblical account ([1 Kings 5:17](/1kgs#1Kgs.5.17), [18](/1kgs#1Kgs.5.18)) is accurately descriptive of the massive masonry now existing at the south-eastern angle (of the temple area), and standing on the native rock 80 feet below the present surface. The Royal Engineers found, buried deeply among the rubbish of many centuries, great stones, costly and hewed stones, forming the foundation of the sanctuary wall; while Phoenician fragments of pottery and Phoenician marks painted on the massive blocks seem to proclaim that the stones were prepared in the quarry by the cunning workmen of Hiram, the king of Tyre.”

 The Phoenicians have been usually regarded as the inventors of alphabetic writing. The Egyptians expressed their thoughts by certain symbols, called “hieroglyphics”, i.e., sacred carvings, so styled because used almost exclusively on sacred subjects. The recent discovery, however, of inscriptions in Southern Arabia (Yemen and Hadramaut), known as Hemyaritic, in connection with various philogical considerations, has led some to the conclusion that the Phoenician alphabet was derived from the Mineans (admitting the antiquity of the kingdom of Ma’in, [Judg. 10:12](/judg#Judg.10.12); [2 Chr. 26:7](/2chr#2Chr.26.7)). Thus the Phoenician alphabet ceases to be the mother alphabet. Sayce thinks “it is more than possible that the Egyptians themselves were emigrants from Southern Arabia.”

 “The Phoenicians were renowned in ancient times for the manufacture of glass, and some of the specimens of this work that have been preserved are still the wonder of mankind...In the matter of shipping, whether ship-building be thought of or traffic upon the sea, the Phoenicians surpassed all other nations.” “The name Phoenicia is of uncertain origin, though it may be derived from Fenkhu, the name given in the Egyptian inscriptions to the natives of Palestine.

While he was there he received a divine command to proceed toward the south, along the road leading from Jerusalem to Gaza. These towns were connected by two roads. The one Philip was directed to take was that which led through Hebron, and thence through a district little inhabited, and hence called “desert.” As he travelled along this road he was overtaken by a chariot in which sat a man of Ethiopia, the eunuch or chief officer of Queen Candace, who was at that moment reading, probably from the Septuagint version, a portion of the prophecies of Isaiah (53:6, 7). Philip entered into conversation with him, and expounded these verses, preaching to him the glad tidings of the Saviour.

"Philippians, Epistle to",4903,p-p245.1,"Philippians, Epistle to","Was written by Paul during the two years when he was “in bonds” in Rome ([Phil. 1:7-13](/phil#Phil.1.7)), probably early in the year A.D. 62 or in the end of 61.

 The Philippians had sent Epaphroditus, their messenger, with contributions to meet the necessities of the apostle; and on his return Paul sent back with him this letter. With this precious communication Epaphroditus sets out on his homeward journey. “The joy caused by his return, and the effect of this wonderful letter when first read in the church of Philippi, are hidden from us. And we may almost say that with this letter the church itself passes from our view. To-day, in silent meadows, quiet cattle browse among the ruins which mark the site of what was once the flourishing Roman colony of Philippi, the home of the most attractive church of the apostolic age. But the name and fame and spiritual influence of that church will never pass. To myriads of men and women in every age and nation the letter written in a dungeon at Rome, and carried along the Egnatian Way by an obscure Christian messenger, has been a light divine and a cheerful guide along the most rugged paths of life” (Professor Beet).

 The church at Philippi was the first-fruits of European Christianity. Their attachment to the apostle was very fervent, and so also was his affection for them. They alone of all the churches helped him by their contributions, which he gratefully acknowledges ([Acts 20:33-35](/acts#Acts.20.33); [2 Cor. 11:7-12](/2cor#2Cor.11.7); [2 Thess. 3:8](/2thess#2Thess.3.8)). The pecuniary liberality of the Philippians comes out very conspicuously ([Phil. 4:15](/phil#Phil.4.15)). “This was a characteristic of the Macedonian missions, as [2 Cor. 8](/2cor#2Cor.8) and 9 amply and beautifully prove. It is remarkable that the Macedonian converts were, as a class, very poor ([2 Cor. 8:2](/2cor#2Cor.8.2)); and the parallel facts, their poverty and their open-handed support of the great missionary and his work, are deeply harmonious. At the present day the missionary liberality of poor Christians is, in proportion, really greater than that of the rich” (Moule’s Philippians, Introd.).

 The contents of this epistle give an interesting insight into the condition of the church at Rome at the time it was written. Paul’s imprisonment, we are informed, was no hindrance to his preaching the gospel, but rather “turned out to the furtherance of the gospel.” The gospel spread very extensively among the Roman soldiers, with whom he was in constant contact, and the Christians grew into a “vast multitude.” It is plain that Christianity was at this time making rapid advancement in Rome.

Philistines,4905,p-p251.4,Philistines,"([Gen. 10:14](/gen#Gen.10.14), R.V.; but in A.V., “Philistim”), a tribe allied to the Phoenicians. They were a branch of the primitive race which spread over the whole district of the Lebanon and the valley of the Jordan, and Crete and other Mediterranean islands. Some suppose them to have been a branch of the Rephaim ([2 Sam. 21:16-22](/2sam#2Sam.21.16)). In the time of Abraham they inhabited the south-west of Judea, Abimelech of Gerar being their king ([Gen. 21:32](/gen#Gen.21.32), [34](/gen#Gen.21.34); 26:1). They are, however, not noticed among the Canaanitish tribes mentioned in the Pentateuch. They are spoken of by Amos (9:7) and Jeremiah (47:4) as from Caphtor, i.e., probably Crete, or, as some think, the Delta of Egypt. In the whole record from Exodus to Samuel they are represented as inhabiting the tract of country which lay between Judea and Egypt ([Ex. 13:17](/exod#Exod.13.17); [15:14](/exod#Exod.15.14), [15](/exod#Exod.15.15); [Josh. 13:3](/josh#Josh.13.3); [1 Sam. 4](/1sam#1Sam.4)).

 This powerful tribe made frequent incursions against the Hebrews. There was almost perpetual war between them. They sometimes held the tribes, especially the southern tribes, in degrading servitude ([Judg. 15:11](/judg#Judg.15.11); [1 Sam. 13:19-22](/1sam#1Sam.13.19)); at other times they were defeated with great slaughter ([1 Sam. 14:1-47](/1sam#1Sam.14.1); [17](/1sam#1Sam.17)). These hostilities did not cease till the time of Hezekiah ([2 Kings 18:8](/2kgs#2Kgs.18.8)), when they were entirely subdued. They still, however, occupied their territory, and always showed their old hatred to Israel ([Ezek. 25:15-17](/ezek#Ezek.25.15)). They were finally conquered by the Romans.

 The Philistines are called Pulsata or Pulista on the Egyptian monuments; the land of the Philistines (Philistia) being termed Palastu and Pilista in the Assyrian inscriptions. They occupied the five cities of Gaza, Ashkelon, Ashdod, Ekron, and Gath, in the south-western corner of Canaan, which belonged to Egypt up to the closing days of the Nineteenth Dynasty. The occupation took place during the reign of Rameses III. of the Twentieth Dynasty. The Philistines had formed part of the great naval confederacy which attacked Egypt, but were eventually repulsed by that Pharaoh, who, however, could not dislodge them from their settlements in Palestine. As they did not enter Palestine till the time of the Exodus, the use of the name Philistines in [Gen. 26:1](/gen#Gen.26.1) must be proleptic. Indeed the country was properly Gerar, as in ch. 20.

 They are called Allophyli, “foreigners,” in the Septuagint, and in the Books of Samuel they are spoken of as uncircumcised. It would therefore appear that they were not of the Semitic race, though after their establishment in Canaan they adopted the Semitic language of the country. We learn from the Old Testament that they came from Caphtor, usually supposed to be Crete. From Philistia the name of the land of the Philistines came to be extended to the whole of “Palestine.” Many scholars identify the Philistines with the Pelethites of [2 Sam. 8:18](/2sam#2Sam.8.18).",0.0,unmatched,unmatched,,

For his faithfulness on that occasion he received the divine approbation (10-13). He afterwards commanded the army that went out against the Midianites (31:6-8).

"Pilate, Pontius",4925,p-p272.4,"Pilate, Pontius","Probably connected with the Roman family of the Pontii, and called “Pilate” from the Latin pileatus, i.e., “wearing the pileus”, which was the “cap or badge of a manumitted slave,” as indicating that he was a “freedman,” or the descendant of one. He was the sixth in the order of the Roman procurators of Judea (A.D. 26-36). His headquarters were at Caesarea, but he frequently went up to Jerusalem. His reign extended over the period of the ministry of John the Baptist and of Jesus Christ, in connection with whose trial his name comes into prominent notice. Pilate was a “typical Roman, not of the antique, simple stamp, but of the imperial period, a man not without some remains of the ancient Roman justice in his soul, yet pleasure-loving, imperious, and corrupt. He hated the Jews whom he ruled, and in times of irritation freely shed their blood. They returned his hatred with cordiality, and accused him of every crime, maladministration, cruelty, and robbery. He visited Jerusalem as seldom as possible; for, indeed, to one accustomed to the pleasures of Rome, with its theatres, baths, games, and gay society, Jerusalem, with its religiousness and ever-smouldering revolt, was a dreary residence. When he did visit it he stayed in the palace of Herod the Great, it being common for the officers sent by Rome into conquered countries to occupy the palaces of the displaced sovereigns.”

 After his trial before the Sanhedrin, Jesus was brought to the Roman procurator, Pilate, who had come up to Jerusalem as usual to preserve order during the Passover, and was now residing, perhaps, in the castle of Antonia, or it may be in Herod’s palace. Pilate came forth from his palace and met the deputation from the Sanhedrin, who, in answer to his inquiry as to the nature of the accusation they had to prefer against Jesus, accused him of being a “malefactor.” Pilate was not satisfied with this, and they further accused him (1) of sedition, (2) preventing the payment of the tribute to Caesar, and (3) of assuming the title of king ([Luke 23:2](/luke#Luke.23.2)). Pilate now withdrew with Jesus into the palace ([John 18:33](/john#John.18.33)) and examined him in private (37, 38); and then going out to the deputation still standing before the gate, he declared that he could find no fault in Jesus ([Luke 23:4](/luke#Luke.23.4)). This only aroused them to more furious clamour, and they cried that he excited the populace “throughout all Jewry, beginning from Galilee.” When Pilate heard of Galilee, he sent the accused to Herod Antipas, who had jurisdiction over that province, thus hoping to escape the difficulty in which he found himself. But Herod, with his men of war, set Jesus at nought, and sent him back again to Pilate, clad in a purple robe of mockery (23:11, 12).

 Pilate now proposed that as he and Herod had found no fault in him, they should release Jesus; and anticipating that they would consent to this proposal, he ascended the judgment-seat as if ready to ratify the decision ([Matt. 27:19](/matt#Matt.27.19)). But at this moment his wife (Claudia Procula) sent a message to him imploring him to have nothing to do with the “just person.” Pilate’s feelings of perplexity and awe were deepened by this incident, while the crowd vehemently cried out, “Not this man, but Barabbas.” Pilate answered, “What then shall I do with Jesus?” The fierce cry immediately followed. “Let him be crucified.” Pilate, apparently vexed, and not knowning what to do, said, “Why, what evil hath he done?” but with yet fiercer fanaticism the crowd yelled out, “Away with him! crucify him, crucify him!” Pilate yielded, and sent Jesus away to be scourged. This scourging was usually inflicted by lictors; but as Pilate was only a procurator he had no lictor, and hence his soldiers inflicted this terrible punishment. This done, the soldiers began to deride the sufferer, and they threw around him a purple robe, probably some old cast-off robe of state ([Matt. 27:28](/matt#Matt.27.28); [John 19:2](/john#John.19.2)), and putting a reed in his right hand, and a crowd of thorns on his head, bowed the knee before him in mockery, and saluted him, saying, “Hail, King of the Jews!” They took also the reed and smote him with it on the head and face, and spat in his face, heaping upon him every indignity.

 Pilate then led forth Jesus from within the Praetorium ([Matt. 27:27](/matt#Matt.27.27)) before the people, wearing the crown of thorns and the purple robe, saying, “Behold the man!” But the sight of Jesus, now scourged and crowned and bleeding, only stirred their hatred the more, and again they cried out, “Crucify him, crucify him!” and brought forth this additional charge against him, that he professed to be “the Son of God.” Pilate heard this accusation with a superstitious awe, and taking him once more within the Praetorium, asked him, “Whence art thou?” Jesus gave him no answer. Pilate was irritated by his continued silence, and said, “Knowest thou not that I have power to crucify thee?” Jesus, with calm dignity, answered the Roman, “Thou couldest have no power at all against me, except it were given thee from above.”

 After this Pilate seemed more resolved than ever to let Jesus go. The crowd perceiving this cried out, “If thou let this man go, thou art not Caesar’s friend.” This settled the matter. He was afraid of being accused to the emperor. Calling for water, he washed his hands in the sight of the people, saying, “I am innocent of the blood of this just person.” The mob, again scorning his scruples, cried, “His blood be on us, and on our children.” Pilate was stung to the heart by their insults, and putting forth Jesus before them, said, “Shall I crucify your King?” The fatal moment had now come. They madly exclaimed, “We have no king but Caesar;” and now Jesus is given up to them, and led away to be crucified.

 By the direction of Pilate an inscription was placed, according to the Roman custom, over the cross, stating the crime for which he was crucified. Having ascertained from the centurion that he was dead, he gave up the body to Joseph of Arimathea to be buried. Pilate’s name now disappears from the Gospel history. References to him, however, are found in the Acts of the Apostles (3:13; 4:27; 13:28), and in [1 Tim. 6:13](/1tim#1Tim.6.13). In A.D. 36 the governor of Syria brought serious accusations against Pilate, and he was banished to Vienne in Gaul, where, according to tradition, he committed suicide.",0.0,person,pilate_2365,pilate_2365,

It has now been satisfactorily identified with Tell-el-Maskhuta, about 12 miles west of Ismailia, and 20 east of Tel-el-Kebir, on the southern bank of the present Suez Canal. Here have recently (1883) been discovered the ruins of supposed grain-chambers, and other evidences to show that this was a great “store city.” Its immense ruin-heaps show that it was built of bricks, and partly also of bricks without straw. Succoth ([Ex. 12:37](/exod#Exod.12.37)) is supposed by some to be the secular name of this city, Pithom being its sacred name. This was the first halting-place of the Israelites in their exodus. It has been argued (Dr. Lansing) that these “store” cities “were residence cities, royal dwellings, such as the Pharaohs of old, the Kings of Israel, and our modern Khedives have ever loved to build, thus giving employment to the superabundant muscle of their enslaved peoples, and making a name for themselves.”",0.0,place,pithom_953,,pithom_953

Pools of Solomon,4983,p-p338.1,Pools of Solomon,"The name given to three large open cisterns at Etam, at the head of the Wady Urtas, having an average length of 400 feet by 220 in breadth, and 20 to 30 in depth. These pools derive their chief supply of water from a spring called “the sealed fountain,” about 200 yards to the north-west of the upper pool, to which it is conveyed by a large subterranean passage. They are 150 feet distant from each other, and each pool is 20 feet lower than that above it, the conduits being so arranged that the lowest, which is the largest and finest of the three, is filled first, and then in succession the others. It has been estimated that these pools cover in all a space of about 7 acres, and are capable of containing three million gallons of water. They were, as is generally supposed, constructed in the days of Solomon. They are probably referred to in [Eccles. 2:6](/eccl#Eccl.2.6). On the fourth day after his victory over the Ammonites, etc., in the wilderness of Tekoa, Jehoshaphat assembled his army in the valley of Berachah (“blessing”), and there blessed the Lord. Berachah has been identified with the modern Bereikut, some 5 miles south of Wady Urtas, and hence the “valley of Berachah” may be this valley of pools, for the word means both “blessing” and “pools;” and it has been supposed, therefore, that this victory was celebrated beside Solomon’s pools ([2 Chr. 20:26](/2chr#2Chr.20.26)).

 These pools were primarily designed to supply Jerusalem with water. From the lower pool an aqueduct has been traced conveying the water through Bethlehem and across the valley of Gihon, and along the west slope of the Tyropoeon valley, till it finds its way into the great cisterns underneath the temple hill. The water, however, from the pools reaches now only to Bethlehem. The aqueduct beyond this has been destroyed.",0.0,unmatched,unmatched,,

Prayer,5013,p-p367.10,Prayer,"Is converse with God; the intercourse of the soul with God, not in contemplation or meditation, but in direct address to him. Prayer may be oral or mental, occasional or constant, ejaculatory or formal. It is a “beseeching the Lord” ([Ex. 32:11](/exod#Exod.32.11)); “pouring out the soul before the Lord” ([1 Sam. 1:15](/1sam#1Sam.1.15)); “praying and crying to heaven” ([2 Chr. 32:20](/2chr#2Chr.32.20)); “seeking unto God and making supplication” ([Job 8:5](/job#Job.8.5)); “drawing near to God” ([Ps. 73:28](/ps#Ps.73.28)); “bowing the knees” ([Eph. 3:14](/eph#Eph.3.14)).

 Prayer presupposes a belief in the personality of God, his ability and willingness to hold intercourse with us, his personal control of all things and of all his creatures and all their actions.

 Acceptable prayer must be sincere ([Heb. 10:22](/heb#Heb.10.22)), offered with reverence and godly fear, with a humble sense of our own insignificance as creatures and of our own unworthiness as sinners, with earnest importunity, and with unhesitating submission to the divine will. Prayer must also be offered in the faith that God is, and is the hearer and answerer of prayer, and that he will fulfil his word, “Ask, and ye shall receive” ([Matt. 7:7](/matt#Matt.7.7), [8](/matt#Matt.7.8); 21:22; [Mark 11:24](/mark#Mark.11.24); [John 14:13](/john#John.14.13), [14](/john#John.14.14)), and in the name of Christ (16:23, 24; 15:16; [Eph. 2:18](/eph#Eph.2.18); [5:20](/eph#Eph.5.20); [Col. 3:17](/col#Col.3.17); [1 Pet. 2:5](/1pet#1Pet.2.5)).

 Prayer is of different kinds, secret ([Matt. 6:6](/matt#Matt.6.6)); social, as family prayers, and in social worship; and public, in the service of the sanctuary.

 Intercessory prayer is enjoined ([Num. 6:23](/num#Num.6.23); [Job 42:8](/job#Job.42.8); [Isa. 62:6](/isa#Isa.62.6); [Ps. 122:6](/ps#Ps.122.6); [1 Tim. 2:1](/1tim#1Tim.2.1); [James 5:14](/jas#Jas.5.14)), and there are many instances on record of answers having been given to such prayers, e.g., of Abraham ([Gen. 17:18](/gen#Gen.17.18), [20](/gen#Gen.17.20); 18:23-32; 20:7, 17, 18), of Moses for Pharaoh ([Ex. 8:12](/exod#Exod.8.12), [13](/exod#Exod.8.13), [30](/exod#Exod.8.30), [31](/exod#Exod.8.31); [Ex. 9:33](/exod#Exod.9.33)), for the Israelites ([Ex. 17:11](/exod#Exod.17.11), [13](/exod#Exod.17.13); 32:11-14, 31-34; [Num. 21:7](/num#Num.21.7), [8](/num#Num.21.8); [Deut. 9:18](/deut#Deut.9.18), [19](/deut#Deut.9.19), [25](/deut#Deut.9.25)), for Miriam ([Num. 12:13](/num#Num.12.13)), for Aaron ([Deut. 9:20](/deut#Deut.9.20)), of Samuel ([1 Sam. 7:5-12](/1sam#1Sam.7.5)), of Solomon ([1 Kings 8](/1kgs#1Kgs.8); [2 Chr. 6](/2chr#2Chr.6)), Elijah ([1 Kings 17:20-23](/1kgs#1Kgs.17.20)), Elisha ([2 Kings 4:33-36](/2kgs#2Kgs.4.33)), Isaiah ([2 Kings 19](/2kgs#2Kgs.19)), Jeremiah (42:2-10), Peter ([Acts 9:40](/acts#Acts.9.40)), the church (12:5-12), Paul (28:8).

 No rules are anywhere in Scripture laid down for the manner of prayer or the attitude to be assumed by the suppliant. There is mention made of kneeling in prayer ([1 Kings 8:54](/1kgs#1Kgs.8.54); [2 Chr. 6:13](/2chr#2Chr.6.13); [Ps. 95:6](/ps#Ps.95.6); [Isa. 45:23](/isa#Isa.45.23); [Luke 22:41](/luke#Luke.22.41); [Acts 7:60](/acts#Acts.7.60); [9:40](/acts#Acts.9.40); [Eph. 3:14](/eph#Eph.3.14), etc.); of bowing and falling prostrate ([Gen. 24:26](/gen#Gen.24.26), [52](/gen#Gen.24.52); [Ex. 4:31](/exod#Exod.4.31); [12:27](/exod#Exod.12.27); [Matt. 26:39](/matt#Matt.26.39); [Mark 14:35](/mark#Mark.14.35), etc.); of spreading out the hands ([1 Kings 8:22](/1kgs#1Kgs.8.22), [38](/1kgs#1Kgs.8.38), [54](/1kgs#1Kgs.8.54); [Ps. 28:2](/ps#Ps.28.2); [63:4](/ps#Ps.63.4); [88:9](/ps#Ps.88.9); [1 Tim. 2:8](/1tim#1Tim.2.8), etc.); and of standing ([1 Sam. 1:26](/1sam#1Sam.1.26); [1 Kings 8:14](/1kgs#1Kgs.8.14), [55](/1kgs#1Kgs.8.55); [2 Chr. 20:9](/2chr#2Chr.20.9); [Mark 11:25](/mark#Mark.11.25); [Luke 18:11](/luke#Luke.18.11), [13](/luke#Luke.18.13)).

 If we except the “Lord’s Prayer” ([Matt. 6:9-13](/matt#Matt.6.9)), which is, however, rather a model or pattern of prayer than a set prayer to be offered up, we have no special form of prayer for general use given us in Scripture.

 Prayer is frequently enjoined in Scripture ([Ex. 22:23](/exod#Exod.22.23), [27](/exod#Exod.22.27); [1 Kings 3:5](/1kgs#1Kgs.3.5); [2 Chr. 7:14](/2chr#2Chr.7.14); [Ps. 37:4](/ps#Ps.37.4); [Isa. 55:6](/isa#Isa.55.6); [Joel 2:32](/joel#Joel.2.32); [Ezek. 36:37](/ezek#Ezek.36.37), etc.), and we have very many testimonies that it has been answered ([Ps. 3:4](/ps#Ps.3.4); [4:1](/ps#Ps.4.1); [6:8](/ps#Ps.6.8); [18:6](/ps#Ps.18.6); [28:6](/ps#Ps.28.6); [30:2](/ps#Ps.30.2); [34:4](/ps#Ps.34.4); [118:5](/ps#Ps.118.5); [James 5:16-18](/jas#Jas.5.16), etc.).

Predestination,5014,p-p385.1,Predestination,"This word is properly used only with reference to God’s plan or purpose of salvation. The Greek word rendered “predestinate” is found only in these six passages, [Acts 4:28](/acts#Acts.4.28); [Rom. 8:29](/rom#Rom.8.29), [30](/rom#Rom.8.30); [1 Cor. 2:7](/1cor#1Cor.2.7); [Eph. 1:5](/eph#Eph.1.5), [11](/eph#Eph.1.11); and in all of them it has the same meaning. They teach that the eternal, sovereign, immutable, and unconditional decree or “determinate purpose” of God governs all events.

 This doctrine of predestination or election is beset with many difficulties. It belongs to the “secret things” of God. But if we take the revealed word of God as our guide, we must accept this doctrine with all its mysteriousness, and settle all our questionings in the humble, devout acknowledgment, “Even so, Father: for so it seemed good in thy sight.”

 For the teaching of Scripture on this subject let the following passages be examined in addition to those referred to above; [Gen. 21:12](/gen#Gen.21.12); [Ex. 9:16](/exod#Exod.9.16); [33:19](/exod#Exod.33.19); [Deut. 10:15](/deut#Deut.10.15); [32:8](/deut#Deut.32.8); [Josh. 11:20](/josh#Josh.11.20); [1 Sam. 12:22](/1sam#1Sam.12.22); [2 Chr. 6:6](/2chr#2Chr.6.6); [Ps. 33:12](/ps#Ps.33.12); [65:4](/ps#Ps.65.4); [78:68](/ps#Ps.78.68); [135:4](/ps#Ps.135.4); [Isa. 41:1-10](/isa#Isa.41.1); [Jer. 1:5](/jer#Jer.1.5); [Mark 13:20](/mark#Mark.13.20); [Luke 22:22](/luke#Luke.22.22); [John 6:37](/john#John.6.37); [15:16](/john#John.15.16); [17:2](/john#John.17.2), [6](/john#John.17.6), [9](/john#John.17.9); [Acts 2:28](/acts#Acts.2.28); [3:18](/acts#Acts.3.18); [4:28](/acts#Acts.4.28); [13:48](/acts#Acts.13.48); [17:26](/acts#Acts.17.26); [Rom. 9:11](/rom#Rom.9.11), [18](/rom#Rom.9.18), [21](/rom#Rom.9.21); [11:5](/rom#Rom.11.5); [Eph. 3:11](/eph#Eph.3.11); [1 Thess. 1:4](/1thess#1Thess.1.4); [2 Thess. 2:13](/2thess#2Thess.2.13); [2 Tim. 1:9](/2tim#2Tim.1.9); [Titus 1:2](/titus#Titus.1.2); [1 Pet. 1:2](/1pet#1Pet.1.2).

Priest,5019,p-p390.2,Priest,"The Heb. kohen, Gr. hierus, Lat. sacerdos, always denote one who offers sacrifices.

 At first every man was his own priest, and presented his own sacrifices before God. Afterwards that office devolved on the head of the family, as in the cases of Noah ([Gen. 8:20](/gen#Gen.8.20)), Abraham (12:7; 13:4), Isaac (26:25), Jacob (31:54), and Job ([Job 1:5](/job#Job.1.5)).

 The name first occurs as applied to Melchizedek ([Gen. 14:18](/gen#Gen.14.18)). Under the Levitical arrangements the office of the priesthood was limited to the tribe of Levi, and to only one family of that tribe, the family of Aaron. Certain laws respecting the qualifications of priests are given in [Lev. 21:16-23](/lev#Lev.21.16). There are ordinances also regarding the priests’ dress ([Ex. 28:40-43](/exod#Exod.28.40)) and the manner of their consecration to the office (29:1-37).

 Their duties were manifold ([Ex. 27:20](/exod#Exod.27.20), [21](/exod#Exod.27.21); 29:38-44; [Lev. 6:12](/lev#Lev.6.12); [10:11](/lev#Lev.10.11); [24:8](/lev#Lev.24.8); [Num. 10:1-10](/num#Num.10.1); [Deut. 17:8-13](/deut#Deut.17.8); [33:10](/deut#Deut.33.10); [Mal. 2:7](/mal#Mal.2.7)). They represented the people before God, and offered the various sacrifices prescribed in the law.

 In the time of David the priests were divided into twenty-four courses or classes ([1 Chr. 24:7-18](/1chr#1Chr.24.7)). This number was retained after the Captivity ([Ezra 2:36-39](/ezra#Ezra.2.36); [Neh. 7:39-42](/neh#Neh.7.39)).

 “The priests were not distributed over the country, but lived together in certain cities [forty-eight in number, of which six were cities of refuge, q.v.], which had been assigned to their use. From thence they went up by turns to minister in the temple at Jerusalem. Thus the religious instruction of the people in the country generally was left to the heads of families, until the establishment of synagogues, an event which did not take place till the return from the Captivity, and which was the main source of the freedom from idolatry that became as marked a feature of the Jewish people thenceforward as its practice had been hitherto their great national sin.”

 The whole priestly system of the Jews was typical. It was a shadow of which the body is Christ. The priests all prefigured the great Priest who offered “one sacrifice for sins” “once for all” ([Heb. 10:10](/heb#Heb.10.10), [12](/heb#Heb.10.12)). There is now no human priesthood. (See Epistle to the Hebrews throughout.) The term “priest” is indeed applied to believers ([1 Pet. 2:9](/1pet#1Pet.2.9); [Rev. 1:6](/rev#Rev.1.6)), but in these cases it implies no sacerdotal functions. All true believers are now “kings and priests unto God.” As priests they have free access into the holiest of all, and offer up the sacrifices of praise and thanksgiving, and the sacrifices of grateful service from day to day.",0.0,unmatched,unmatched,,
Prince,5020,p-p397.5,Prince,"The title generally applied to the chief men of the state. The “princes of the provinces” ([1 Kings 20:14](/1kgs#1Kgs.20.14)) were the governors or lord-lieutenants of the provinces.

Prison,5022,p-p399.5,Prison,"The first occasion on which we read of a prison is in the history of Joseph in Egypt. Then Potiphar, “Joseph’s master, took him, and put him into the prison, a place where the king’s prisoners were bound” ([Gen. 39:20-23](/gen#Gen.39.20)). The Heb. word here used (sohar) means properly a round tower or fortress. It seems to have been a part of Potiphar’s house, a place in which state prisoners were kept.

 The Mosaic law made no provision for imprisonment as a punishment. In the wilderness two persons were “put in ward” ([Lev. 24:12](/lev#Lev.24.12); [Num. 15:34](/num#Num.15.34)), but it was only till the mind of God concerning them should be ascertained. Prisons and prisoners are mentioned in the book of Psalms (69:33; 79:11; 142:7). Samson was confined in a Philistine prison ([Judg. 16:21](/judg#Judg.16.21), [25](/judg#Judg.16.25)). In the subsequent history of Israel frequent references are made to prisons ([1 Kings 22:27](/1kgs#1Kgs.22.27); [2 Kings 17:4](/2kgs#2Kgs.17.4); [25:27](/2kgs#2Kgs.25.27), [29](/2kgs#2Kgs.25.29); [2 Chr. 16:10](/2chr#2Chr.16.10); [Isa. 42:7](/isa#Isa.42.7); [Jer. 32:2](/jer#Jer.32.2)). Prisons seem to have been common in New Testament times ([Matt. 11:2](/matt#Matt.11.2); [25:36](/matt#Matt.25.36), [43](/matt#Matt.25.43)). The apostles were put into the “common prison” at the instance of the Jewish council ([Acts 5:18](/acts#Acts.5.18), [23](/acts#Acts.5.23); 8:3); and at Philippi Paul and Silas were thrust into the “inner prison” (16:24; comp. 4:3; 12:4, 5).",0.0,unmatched,unmatched,,
Prophecy,5023,p-p401.17,Prophecy,"Or prediction, was one of the functions of the prophet. It has been defined as a “miracle of knowledge, a declaration or description or representation of something future, beyond the power of human sagacity to foresee, discern, or conjecture.”

 The great prediction which runs like a golden thread through the whole contents of the Old Testament is that regarding the coming and work of the Messiah; and the great use of prophecy was to perpetuate faith in his coming, and to prepare the world for that event. But there are many subordinate and intermediate prophecies also which hold an important place in the great chain of events which illustrate the sovereignty and all-wise overruling providence of God.

 Then there are many prophecies regarding the Jewish nation, its founder Abraham ([Gen. 12:1-3](/gen#Gen.12.1); [13:16](/gen#Gen.13.16); [15:5](/gen#Gen.15.5); [17:2](/gen#Gen.17.2), [4-6](/gen#Gen.17.4), etc.), and his posterity, Isaac and Jacob and their descendants (12:7; 13:14, 15, 17; 15:18-21; [Ex. 3:8](/exod#Exod.3.8), [17](/exod#Exod.3.17)), which have all been fulfilled. The twenty-eighth chapter of Deuteronomy contains a series of predictions which are even now in the present day being fulfilled. In the writings of the prophets Isaiah (2:18-21), Jeremiah (27:3-7; 29:11-14), Ezekiel (5:12; 8), Daniel (8; 9:26, 27), Hosea (9:17), there are also many prophecies regarding the events which were to befall that people.

 There is in like manner a large number of prophecies relating to those nations with which the Jews came into contact, as Tyre ([Ezek. 26:3-5](/ezek#Ezek.26.3), [14-21](/ezek#Ezek.26.14)), Egypt ([Ezek. 29:10](/ezek#Ezek.29.10), [15](/ezek#Ezek.29.15); 30:6, 12, 13), Ethiopia ([Nahum 3:8-10](/nah#Nah.3.8)), Nineveh ([Nahum 1:10](/nah#Nah.1.10); [2:8-13](/nah#Nah.2.8); [3:17-19](/nah#Nah.3.17)), Babylon ([Isa. 13:4](/isa#Isa.13.4); [Jer. 51:7](/jer#Jer.51.7); [Isa. 44:27](/isa#Isa.44.27); [Jer. 50:38](/jer#Jer.50.38); [51:36](/jer#Jer.51.36), [39](/jer#Jer.51.39), [57](/jer#Jer.51.57)), the land of the Philistines ([Jer. 47:4-7](/jer#Jer.47.4); [Ezek. 25:15-17](/ezek#Ezek.25.15); [Amos 1:6-8](/amos#Amos.1.6); [Zeph. 2:4-7](/zeph#Zeph.2.4); [Zech. 9:5-8](/zech#Zech.9.5)), and of the four great monarchies ([Dan. 2:39](/dan#Dan.2.39), [40](/dan#Dan.2.40); 7:17-24; 8:9).

 But the great body of Old Testament prophecy relates directly to the advent of the Messiah, beginning with [Gen. 3:15](/gen#Gen.3.15), the first great promise, and extending in ever-increasing fulness and clearness all through to the very close of the canon. The Messianic prophecies are too numerous to be quoted. “To him gave all the prophets witness.” (Comp. [Micah 5:2](/mic#Mic.5.2); [Hag. 2:6-9](/hag#Hag.2.6); [Isa. 7:14](/isa#Isa.7.14); [9:6](/isa#Isa.9.6), [7](/isa#Isa.9.7); [11:1](/isa#Isa.11.1), [2](/isa#Isa.11.2); [53](/isa#Isa.53); [60:10](/isa#Isa.60.10), [13](/isa#Isa.60.13); [Ps. 16:11](/ps#Ps.16.11); [68:18](/ps#Ps.68.18).)

 Many predictions also were delivered by Jesus and his apostles. Those of Christ were very numerous. (Comp. [Matt. 10:23](/matt#Matt.10.23):24; 11:23; 19:28; 21:43, 44; 24; 25:31-46; 26:17-35, 46, 64; [Mark 9:1](/mark#Mark.9.1); [10:30](/mark#Mark.10.30); [13](/mark#Mark.13); [11:1-6](/mark#Mark.11.1), [14](/mark#Mark.11.14); [14:12-31](/mark#Mark.14.12), [42](/mark#Mark.14.42), [62](/mark#Mark.14.62); [16:17](/mark#Mark.16.17), etc.)",0.0,unmatched,unmatched,,
Prophet,5024,p-p407.11,Prophet,"(Heb. nabi, from a root meaning “to bubble forth, as from a fountain,” hence “to utter”, comp. [Ps. 45:1](/ps#Ps.45.1)). This Hebrew word is the first and the most generally used for a prophet. In the time of Samuel another word, ro’eh, “seer”, began to be used ([1 Sam. 9:9](/1sam#1Sam.9.9)). It occurs seven times in reference to Samuel. Afterwards another word, hozeh, “seer” ([2 Sam. 24:11](/2sam#2Sam.24.11)), was employed. In [1 Ch. 29:29](/1chr#1Chr.29.29) all these three words are used: “Samuel the seer (ro’eh), Nathan the prophet (nabi’), Gad the seer” (hozeh). In [Josh. 13:22](/josh#Josh.13.22) Balaam is called (Heb.) a kosem “diviner,” a word used only of a false prophet.

 The “prophet” proclaimed the message given to him, as the “seer” beheld the vision of God. (See [Num. 12:6](/num#Num.12.6), [8](/num#Num.12.8).) Thus a prophet was a spokesman for God; he spake in God’s name and by his authority ([Ex. 7:1](/exod#Exod.7.1)). He is the mouth by which God speaks to men ([Jer. 1:9](/jer#Jer.1.9); [Isa. 51:16](/isa#Isa.51.16)), and hence what the prophet says is not of man but of God (2 Pet. 1:20, [21](/2pet#2Pet.1.21); comp. [Heb. 3:7](/heb#Heb.3.7); [Acts 4:25](/acts#Acts.4.25); [28:25](/acts#Acts.28.25)). Prophets were the immediate organs of God for the communication of his mind and will to men ([Deut. 18:18](/deut#Deut.18.18), [19](/deut#Deut.18.19)). The whole Word of God may in this general sense be spoken of as prophetic, inasmuch as it was written by men who received the revelation they communicated from God, no matter what its nature might be. The foretelling of future events was not a necessary but only an incidental part of the prophetic office. The great task assigned to the prophets whom God raised up among the people was “to correct moral and religious abuses, to proclaim the great moral and religious truths which are connected with the character of God, and which lie at the foundation of his government.”

 Any one being a spokesman for God to man might thus be called a prophet. Thus Enoch, Abraham, and the patriarchs, as bearers of God’s message ([Gen. 20:7](/gen#Gen.20.7); [Ex. 7:1](/exod#Exod.7.1); [Ps. 105:15](/ps#Ps.105.15)), as also Moses ([Deut. 18:15](/deut#Deut.18.15); [34:10](/deut#Deut.34.10); [Hos. 12:13](/hos#Hos.12.13)), are ranked among the prophets. The seventy elders of Israel ([Num. 11:16-29](/num#Num.11.16)), “when the spirit rested upon them, prophesied;” Asaph and Jeduthun “prophesied with a harp” ([1 Chr. 25:3](/1chr#1Chr.25.3)). Miriam and Deborah were prophetesses ([Ex. 15:20](/exod#Exod.15.20); [Judg. 4:4](/judg#Judg.4.4)). The title thus has a general application to all who have messages from God to men.

 But while the prophetic gift was thus exercised from the beginning, the prophetical order as such began with Samuel. Colleges, “schools of the prophets”, were instituted for the training of prophets, who were constituted, a distinct order ([1 Sam. 19:18-24](/1sam#1Sam.19.18); [2 Kings 2:3](/2kgs#2Kgs.2.3), [15](/2kgs#2Kgs.2.15); 4:38), which continued to the close of the Old Testament. Such “schools” were established at Ramah, Bethel, Gilgal, Gibeah, and Jericho. The “sons” or “disciples” of the prophets were young men ([2 Kings 5:22](/2kgs#2Kgs.5.22); [9:1](/2kgs#2Kgs.9.1), [4](/2kgs#2Kgs.9.4)) who lived together at these different “schools” (4:38-41). These young men were taught not only the rudiments of secular knowledge, but they were brought up to exercise the office of prophet, “to preach pure morality and the heart-felt worship of Jehovah, and to act along and co-ordinately with the priesthood and monarchy in guiding the state aright and checking all attempts at illegality and tyranny.”

 In New Testament times the prophetical office was continued. Our Lord is frequently spoken of as a prophet ([Luke 13:33](/luke#Luke.13.33); [24:19](/luke#Luke.24.19)). He was and is the great Prophet of the Church. There was also in the Church a distinct order of prophets ([1 Cor. 12:28](/1cor#1Cor.12.28); [Eph. 2:20](/eph#Eph.2.20); [3:5](/eph#Eph.3.5)), who made new revelations from God. They differed from the “teacher,” whose office it was to impart truths already revealed.

Propitiation,5029,p-p417.1,Propitiation,"That by which God is rendered propitious, i.e., by which it becomes consistent with his character and government to pardon and bless the sinner. The propitiation does not procure his love or make him loving; it only renders it consistent for him to execise his love towards sinners.

 In [Rom. 3:25](/rom#Rom.3.25) and [Heb. 9:5](/heb#Heb.9.5) (A.V., “mercy-seat”) the Greek word hilasterion is used. It is the word employed by the LXX. translators in [Ex. 25:17](/exod#Exod.25.17) and elsewhere as the equivalent for the Hebrew kapporeth, which means “covering,” and is used of the lid of the ark of the covenant ([Ex. 25:21](/exod#Exod.25.21); [30:6](/exod#Exod.30.6)). This Greek word (hilasterion) came to denote not only the mercy-seat or lid of the ark, but also propitation or reconciliation by blood. On the great day of atonement the high priest carried the blood of the sacrifice he offered for all the people within the veil and sprinkled with it the “mercy-seat,” and so made propitiation.

 In [1 John 2:2](/1john#1John.2.2); [4:10](/1john#1John.4.10), Christ is called the “propitiation for our sins.” Here a different Greek word is used (hilasmos). Christ is “the propitiation,” because by his becoming our substitute and assuming our obligations he expiated our guilt, covered it, by the vicarious punishment which he endured. (Comp. [Heb. 2:17](/heb#Heb.2.17), where the expression “make reconciliation” of the A.V. is more correctly in the R.V. “make propitiation.”)",0.0,unmatched,unmatched,,
Proportion of faith,5030,p-p420.4,Proportion of faith,"([Rom. 12:6](/rom#Rom.12.6)). Paul says here that each one was to exercise his gift of prophecy, i.e., of teaching, “according to the proportion of faith.” The meaning is, that the utterances of the “prophet” were not to fluctuate according to his own impulses or independent thoughts, but were to be adjusted to the truth revealed to him as a beliver, i.e., were to be in accordance with it.

 In post-Reformation times this phrase was used as meaning that all Scripture was to be interpreted with reference to all other Scripture, i.e., that no words or expressions were to be isolated or interpreted in a way contrary to its general teaching. This was also called the “analogy of faith.”",0.0,unmatched,unmatched,,
Proselyte,5031,p-p422.1,Proselyte,"Is used in the LXX. for “stranger” ([1 Chr. 22:2](/1chr#1Chr.22.2)), i.e., a comer to Palestine; a sojourner in the land ([Ex. 12:48](/exod#Exod.12.48); [20:10](/exod#Exod.20.10); [22:21](/exod#Exod.22.21)), and in the New Testament for a convert to Judaism. There were such converts from early times ([Isa. 56:3](/isa#Isa.56.3); [Neh. 10:28](/neh#Neh.10.28); [Esther 8:17](/esth#Esth.8.17)). The law of Moses made specific regulations regarding the admission into the Jewish church of such as were not born Israelites ([Ex. 20:10](/exod#Exod.20.10); [23:12](/exod#Exod.23.12); [12:19](/exod#Exod.12.19), [48](/exod#Exod.12.48); [Deut. 5:14](/deut#Deut.5.14); [16:11](/deut#Deut.16.11), [14](/deut#Deut.16.14), etc.). The Kenites, the Gibeonites, the Cherethites, and the Pelethites were thus admitted to the privileges of Israelites. Thus also we hear of individual proselytes who rose to positions of prominence in Israel, as of Doeg the Edomite, Uriah the Hittite, Araunah the Jebusite, Zelek the Ammonite, Ithmah and Ebedmelech the Ethiopians.

 In the time of Solomon there were one hundred and fifty-three thousand six hundred strangers in the land of Israel ([1 Chr. 22:2](/1chr#1Chr.22.2); [2 Chr. 2:17](/2chr#2Chr.2.17), [18](/2chr#2Chr.2.18)). And the prophets speak of the time as coming when the strangers shall share in all the privileges of Israel ([Ezek. 47:22](/ezek#Ezek.47.22); [Isa. 2:2](/isa#Isa.2.2); [11:10](/isa#Isa.11.10); [56:3-6](/isa#Isa.56.3); [Micah 4:1](/mic#Mic.4.1)). Accordingly, in New Testament times, we read of proselytes in the synagogues, ([Acts 10:2](/acts#Acts.10.2), [7](/acts#Acts.10.7); 13:42, 43, 50; 17:4; 18:7; [Luke 7:5](/luke#Luke.7.5)). The “religious proselytes” here spoken of were proselytes of righteousness, as distinguished from proselytes of the gate.

 The distinction between “proselytes of the gate” ([Ex. 20:10](/exod#Exod.20.10)) and “proselytes of righteousness” originated only with the rabbis. According to them, the “proselytes of the gate” (half proselytes) were not required to be circumcised nor to comply with the Mosaic ceremonial law. They were bound only to conform to the so-called seven precepts of Noah, viz., to abstain from idolatry, blasphemy, bloodshed, uncleaness, the eating of blood, theft, and to yield obedience to the authorities. Besides these laws, however, they were required to abstain from work on the Sabbath, and to refrain from the use of leavened bread during the time of the Passover.

 The “proselytes of righteousness”, religious or devout proselytes ([Acts 13:43](/acts#Acts.13.43)), were bound to all the doctrines and precepts of the Jewish economy, and were members of the synagogue in full communion.

It impresses upon us in the most forcible manner the value of intelligence and prudence and of a good education. The whole strength of the Hebrew language and of the sacred authority of the book is thrown upon these homely truths. It deals, too, in that refined, discriminating, careful view of the finer shades of human character so often overlooked by theologians, but so necessary to any true estimate of human life” (Stanley’s Jewish Church).

 As to the origin of this book, “it is probable that Solomon gathered and recast many proverbs which sprang from human experience in preceeding ages and were floating past him on the tide of time, and that he also elaborated many new ones from the material of his own experience. Towards the close of the book, indeed, are preserved some of Solomon’s own sayings that seem to have fallen from his lips in later life and been gathered by other hands’ (Arnot’s Laws from Heaven, etc.)

Psalms,5038,p-p438.10,Psalms,"The psalms are the production of various authors. “Only a portion of the Book of Psalms claims David as its author. Other inspired poets in successive generations added now one now another contribution to the sacred collection, and thus in the wisdom of Providence it more completely reflects every phase of human emotion and circumstances than it otherwise could.” But it is specially to David and his contemporaries that we owe this precious book. In the “titles” of the psalms, the genuineness of which there is no sufficient reason to doubt, 73 are ascribed to David. Peter and John ([Acts 4:25](/acts#Acts.4.25)) ascribe to him also the second psalm, which is one of the 48 that are anonymous. About two-thirds of the whole collection have been ascribed to David.

 [Psalms 39](/ps#Ps.39), [62](/ps#Ps.62), and 77 are addressed to Jeduthun, to be sung after his manner or in his choir. [Psalms 50](/ps#Ps.50) and 73-83 are addressed to Asaph, as the master of his choir, to be sung in the worship of God. The “sons of Korah,” who formed a leading part of the Kohathite singers ([2 Chr. 20:19](/2chr#2Chr.20.19)), were intrusted with the arranging and singing of [Ps. 42](/ps#Ps.42), [44](/ps#Ps.44)-49, 84, 85, 87, and 88.

 In [Luke 24:44](/luke#Luke.24.44) the word “psalms” means the Hagiographa, i.e., the holy writings, one of the sections into which the Jews divided the Old Testament.

 None of the psalms can be proved to have been of a later date than the time of Ezra and Nehemiah, hence the whole collection extends over a period of about 1,000 years. There are in the New Testament 116 direct quotations from the Psalter.

 “It is presumed that these several collections were made at times of high religious life: the first, probably, near the close of David’s life; the second in the days of Solomon; the third by the singers of Jehoshaphat ([2 Chr. 20:19](/2chr#2Chr.20.19)); the fourth by the men of Hezekiah (29, 30, 31); and the fifth in the days of Ezra.”

Huge blocks of stone are still found in these caves bearing the marks of pick and chisel. The general appearance of the whole suggests to the explorer the idea that the Phoenician quarrymen have just suspended their work. The supposition that the polished blocks of stone for Solomon’s temple were sent by Hiram from Lebanon or Tyre is not supported by any evidence (comp. [1 Kings 5:8](/1kgs#1Kgs.5.8)).

In [1 Kings 11:19](/1kgs#1Kgs.11.19), Pharaoh’s wife is called “the queen,” but the Hebrew word so rendered (g’birah) is simply a title of honour, denoting a royal lady, used sometimes for “queen-mother” ([1 Kings 15:13](/1kgs#1Kgs.15.13); [2 Chron. 15:16](/2chr#2Chr.15.16)).

Quotations,5084,q-p12.8,Quotations,"From the Old Testament in the New, which are very numerous, are not made according to any uniform method. When the New Testament was written, the Old was not divided, as it now is, into chapters and verses, and hence such peculiarities as these: When Luke (20:37) refers to [Ex. 3:6](/exod#Exod.3.6), he quotes from “Moses at the bush”, i.e., the section containing the record of Moses at the bush. So also Mark (2:26) refers to [1 Sam. 21:1-6](/1sam#1Sam.21.1), in the words, “in the days of Abiathar;” and Paul ([Rom. 11:2](/rom#Rom.11.2)) refers to 1 Kings ch. 17-19, in the words, “in Elias”, i.e., in the portion of the history regarding Elias.

 In general, the New Testament writers quote from the Septuagint (q.v.) version of the Old Testament, as it was then in common use among the Jews. But it is noticeable that these quotations are not made in any uniform manner. Sometimes, e.g., the quotation does not agree literally either with the LXX. or the Hebrew text. This occurs in about one hundred instances. Sometimes the LXX. is literally quoted (in about ninety instances), and sometimes it is corrected or altered in the quotations (in over eighty instances).

 Quotations are sometimes made also directly from the Hebrew text ([Matt. 4:15](/matt#Matt.4.15), [16](/matt#Matt.4.16); [John 19:37](/john#John.19.37); [1 Cor. 15:54](/1cor#1Cor.15.54)). Besides the quotations made directly, there are found numberless allusions, more or less distinct, showing that the minds of the New Testament writers were filled with the expressions and ideas as well as historical facts recorded in the Old.

 There are in all two hundred and eighty-three direct quotations from the Old Testament in the New, but not one clear and certain case of quotation from the Apocrypha (q.v.).

 Besides quotations in the New from the Old Testament, there are in Paul’s writings three quotations from certain Greek poets, [Acts 17:28](/acts#Acts.17.28); [1 Cor. 15:33](/1cor#1Cor.15.33); [Titus 1:12](/titus#Titus.1.12).

After David had subdued all their allies in a great war, he sent Joab with a strong force to take their city. For two years it held out against its assailants. It was while his army was engaged in this protracted siege that David was guilty of that deed of shame which left a blot on his character and cast a gloom over the rest of his life. At length, having taken the “royal city” (or the “city of waters,” [2 Sam. 12:27](/2sam#2Sam.12.27), i.e., the lower city on the river, as distinguished from the citadel), Joab sent for David to direct the final assault (11:1; 12:26-31). The city was given up to plunder, and the people were ruthlessly put to death, and “thus did he with all the cities of the children of Ammon.” The destruction of Rabbath was the last of David’s conquests.

The fact of her covering the spies with bundles of flax which lay on her house-roof (2:6) is an ‘undesigned coincidence’ which strictly corroborates the narrative.

Redemption,5152,r-p63.9,Redemption,"The purchase back of something that had been lost, by the payment of a ransom. The Greek word so rendered is apolutrosis, a word occurring nine times in Scripture, and always with the idea of a ransom or price paid, i.e., redemption by a lutron (see [Matt. 20:28](/matt#Matt.20.28); [Mark 10:45](/mark#Mark.10.45)). There are instances in the LXX. Version of the Old Testament of the use of lutron in man’s relation to man ([Lev. 19:20](/lev#Lev.19.20); [25:51](/lev#Lev.25.51); [Ex. 21:30](/exod#Exod.21.30); [Num. 35:31](/num#Num.35.31), [32](/num#Num.35.32); [Isa. 45:13](/isa#Isa.45.13); [Prov. 6:35](/prov#Prov.6.35)), and in the same sense of man’s relation to God ([Num. 3:49](/num#Num.3.49); [18:15](/num#Num.18.15)).

 There are many passages in the New Testament which represent Christ’s sufferings under the idea of a ransom or price, and the result thereby secured is a purchase or redemption (comp. [Acts 20:28](/acts#Acts.20.28); [1 Cor. 6:19](/1cor#1Cor.6.19), [20](/1cor#1Cor.6.20); [Gal. 3:13](/gal#Gal.3.13); [4:4](/gal#Gal.4.4), [5](/gal#Gal.4.5); [Eph. 1:7](/eph#Eph.1.7); [Col. 1:14](/col#Col.1.14); [1 Tim. 2:5](/1tim#1Tim.2.5), [6](/1tim#1Tim.2.6); [Titus 2:14](/titus#Titus.2.14); [Heb. 9:12](/heb#Heb.9.12); [1 Pet. 1:18](/1pet#1Pet.1.18), [19](/1pet#1Pet.1.19); [Rev. 5:9](/rev#Rev.5.9)). The idea running through all these texts, however various their reference, is that of payment made for our redemption. The debt against us is not viewed as simply cancelled, but is fully paid. Christ’s blood or life, which he surrendered for them, is the “ransom” by which the deliverance of his people from the servitude of sin and from its penal consequences is secured. It is the plain doctrine of Scripture that “Christ saves us neither by the mere exercise of power, nor by his doctrine, nor by his example, nor by the moral influence which he exerted, nor by any subjective influence on his people, whether natural or mystical, but as a satisfaction to divine justice, as an expiation for sin, and as a ransom from the curse and authority of the law, thus reconciling us to God by making it consistent with his perfection to exercise mercy toward sinners” (Hodge’s Systematic Theology).",0.0,unmatched,unmatched,,
Red Sea,5153,r-p65.16,Red Sea,"The sea so called extends along the west coast of Arabia for about 1,400 miles, and separates Asia from Africa. It is connected with the Indian Ocean, of which it is an arm, by the Strait of Bab-el-Mandeb. At a point (Ras Mohammed) about 200 miles from its nothern extremity it is divided into two arms, that on the east called the AElanitic Gulf, now the Bahr el-‘Akabah, about 100 miles long by 15 broad, and that on the west the Gulf of Suez, about 150 miles long by about 20 broad. This branch is now connected with the Mediterranean by the Suez Canal. Between these two arms lies the Sinaitic Peninsula.

 The Hebrew name generally given to this sea is Yam Suph. This word suph means a woolly kind of sea-weed, which the sea casts up in great abundance on its shores. In these passages, [Ex. 10:19](/exod#Exod.10.19); [13:18](/exod#Exod.13.18); [15:4](/exod#Exod.15.4), [22](/exod#Exod.15.22); [23:31](/exod#Exod.23.31); [Num. 14:25](/num#Num.14.25), etc., the Hebrew name is always translated “Red Sea,” which was the name given to it by the Greeks. The origin of this name (Red Sea) is uncertain. Some think it is derived from the red colour of the mountains on the western shore; others from the red coral found in the sea, or the red appearance sometimes given to the water by certain zoophytes floating in it. In the New Testament ([Acts 7:36](/acts#Acts.7.36); [Heb. 11:29](/heb#Heb.11.29)) this name is given to the Gulf of Suez.

 This sea was also called by the Hebrews Yam-mitstraim, i.e., “the Egyptian sea” ([Isa. 11:15](/isa#Isa.11.15)), and simply Ha-yam, “the sea” ([Ex. 14:2](/exod#Exod.14.2), [9](/exod#Exod.14.9), [16](/exod#Exod.14.16), [21](/exod#Exod.14.21), [28](/exod#Exod.14.28); [Josh. 24:6](/josh#Josh.24.6), [7](/josh#Josh.24.7); [Isa. 10:26](/isa#Isa.10.26), etc.).

The difficulty of arriving at any definite conclusion on the matter is much increased by the consideration that the head of the Gulf of Suez, which was the branch of the sea that was crossed, must have extended at the time of the Exodus probably 50 miles farther north than it does at present. Some have argued that the crossing took place opposite the Wady Tawarik, where the sea is at present some 7 miles broad.

Regeneration,5161,r-p77.2,Regeneration,"Only found in [Matt. 19:28](/matt#Matt.19.28) and [Titus 3:5](/titus#Titus.3.5). This word literally means a “new birth.” The Greek word so rendered (palingenesia) is used by classical writers with reference to the changes produced by the return of spring. In [Matt. 19:28](/matt#Matt.19.28) the word is equivalent to the “restitution of all things” ([Acts 3:21](/acts#Acts.3.21)). In [Titus 3:5](/titus#Titus.3.5) it denotes that change of heart elsewhere spoken of as a passing from death to life ([1 John 3:14](/1john#1John.3.14)); becoming a new creature in Christ Jesus ([2 Cor. 5:17](/2cor#2Cor.5.17)); being born again ([John 3:5](/john#John.3.5)); a renewal of the mind ([Rom. 12:2](/rom#Rom.12.2)); a resurrection from the dead ([Eph. 2:6](/eph#Eph.2.6)); a being quickened (2:1, 5).

 This change is ascribed to the Holy Spirit. It originates not with man but with God ([John 1:12](/john#John.1.12), [13](/john#John.1.13); [1 John 2:29](/1john#1John.2.29); [5:1](/1john#1John.5.1), [4](/1john#1John.5.4)).

 As to the nature of the change, it consists in the implanting of a new principle or disposition in the soul; the impartation of spiritual life to those who are by nature “dead in trespasses and sins.”

 The necessity of such a change is emphatically affirmed in Scripture ([John 3:3](/john#John.3.3); [Rom. 7:18](/rom#Rom.7.18); [8:7-9](/rom#Rom.8.7); [1 Cor. 2:14](/1cor#1Cor.2.14); [Eph. 2:1](/eph#Eph.2.1); [4:21-24](/eph#Eph.4.21)).",0.0,unmatched,unmatched,,

Rehoboam,5169,r-p87.3,Rehoboam,"He enlarges the people, the successor of Solomon on the throne, and apparently his only son. He was the son of Naamah “the Ammonitess,” some well-known Ammonitish princess ([1 Kings 14:21](/1kgs#1Kgs.14.21); [2 Chr. 12:13](/2chr#2Chr.12.13)). He was forty-one years old when he ascended the throne, and he reigned seventeen years (B.C. 975-958). Although he was acknowledged at once as the rightful heir to the throne, yet there was a strongly-felt desire to modify the character of the government. The burden of taxation to which they had been subjected during Solomon’s reign was very oppressive, and therefore the people assembled at Shechem and demanded from the king an alleviation of their burdens. He went to meet them at Shechem, and heard their demands for relief ([1 Kings 12:4](/1kgs#1Kgs.12.4)). After three days, having consulted with a younger generation of courtiers that had grown up around him, instead of following the advice of elders, he answered the people haughtily (6-15). “The king hearkened not unto the people; for the cause was from the Lord” (comp. 11:31). This brought matters speedily to a crisis. The terrible cry was heard (comp. [2 Sam. 20:1](/2sam#2Sam.20.1)):

 “What portion have we in David?  Neither have we inheritance in the son of Jesse:  To your tents, O Israel:  Now see to thine own house, David” ([1 Kings 12:16](/1kgs#1Kgs.12.16)).

 And now at once the kingdom was rent in twain. Rehoboam was appalled, and tried concessions, but it was too late (18). The tribe of Judah, Rehoboam’s own tribe, alone remained faithful to him. Benjamin was reckoned along with Judah, and these two tribes formed the southern kingdom, with Jerusalem as its capital; while the northern ten tribes formed themselves into a separate kingdom, choosing Jeroboam as their king. Rehoboam tried to win back the revolted ten tribes by making war against them, but he was prevented by the prophet Shemaiah (21-24; [2 Chr. 11:1-4](/2chr#2Chr.11.1)) from fulfilling his purpose.

 In the fifth year of Rehoboam’s reign, Shishak (q.v.), one of the kings of Egypt of the Assyrian dynasty, stirred up, no doubt, by Jeroboam his son-in-law, made war against him. Jerusalem submitted to the invader, who plundered the temple and virtually reduced the kingdom to the position of a vassal of Egypt ([1 Kings 14:25](/1kgs#1Kgs.14.25), [26](/1kgs#1Kgs.14.26); [2 Chr. 12:5-9](/2chr#2Chr.12.5)). A remarkable memorial of this invasion has been discovered at Karnac, in Upper Egypt, in certain sculptures on the walls of a small temple there. These sculptures represent the king, Shishak, holding in his hand a train of prisoners and other figures, with the names of the captured towns of Judah, the towns which Rehoboam had fortified ([2 Chr. 11:5-12](/2chr#2Chr.11.5)).

 The kingdom of Judah, under Rehoboam, sank more and more in moral and spiritual decay. “There was war between Rehoboam and Jeroboam all their days.” At length, in the fifty-eighth year of his age, Rehoboam “slept with his fathers, and was buried with his fathers in the city of David” ([1 Kings 14:31](/1kgs#1Kgs.14.31)). He was succeeded by his son Abijah.",0.0,person,rehoboam_2412,rehoboam_2412,

Repentance 2,5193,r-p110.2,Repentance,"Metanoeo, meaning to change one’s mind and purpose, as the result of after knowledge. This verb, with (3) the cognate noun metanoia, is used of true repentance, a change of mind and purpose and life, to which remission of sin is promised.

 Evangelical repentance consists of (1) a true sense of one’s own guilt and sinfulness; (2) an apprehension of God’s mercy in Christ; (3) an actual hatred of sin ([Ps. 119:128](/ps#Ps.119.128); [Job 42:5](/job#Job.42.5), [6](/job#Job.42.6); [2 Cor. 7:10](/2cor#2Cor.7.10)) and turning from it to God; and (4) a persistent endeavour after a holy life in a walking with God in the way of his commandments.

 The true penitent is conscious of guilt ([Ps. 51:4](/ps#Ps.51.4), [9](/ps#Ps.51.9)), of pollution (51:5, 7, 10), and of helplessness (51:11; 109:21, 22).

Thus all communication between Bethlehem and Jerusalem was intercepted. While David and his army were encamped here, there occurred that incident narrated in [2 Sam. 23:15-17](/2sam#2Sam.23.15). Having obtained divine direction, David led his army against the Philistines, and gained a complete victory over them. The scene of this victory was afterwards called Baalperazim (q.v.).

 A second time, however, the Philistines rallied their forces in this valley ([2 Sam. 5:22](/2sam#2Sam.5.22)). Again warned by a divine oracle, David led his army to Gibeon, and attacked the Philistines from the south, inflicting on them another severe defeat, and chasing them with great slaughter to Gezer (q.v.).

Resurrection of Christ 10,5216,r-p127.2,Resurrection of Christ,"To the apostles immediately before the ascension.

 It is worthy of note that it is distinctly related that on most of these occasions our Lord afforded his disciples the amplest opportunity of testing the fact of his resurrection. He conversed with them face to face. They touched him ([Matt. 28:9](/matt#Matt.28.9); [Luke 24:39](/luke#Luke.24.39); [John 20:27](/john#John.20.27)), and he ate bread with them ([Luke 24:42](/luke#Luke.24.42), [43](/luke#Luke.24.43); [John 21:12](/john#John.21.12), [13](/john#John.21.13)).",10.0,unmatched,unmatched,,
Resurrection of Christ 11,5217,r-p127.2,Resurrection of Christ,"In addition to the above, mention might be made of Christ’s manifestation of himself to Paul at Damascus, who speaks of it as an appearance of the risen Saviour ([Acts 9:3-9](/acts#Acts.9.3), [17](/acts#Acts.9.17); [1 Cor. 15:8](/1cor#1Cor.15.8); [9:1](/1cor#1Cor.9.1)).

 It is implied in the words of Luke ([Acts 1:3](/acts#Acts.1.3)) that there may have been other appearances of which we have no record.

 The resurrection is spoken of as the act (1) of God the Father ([Ps. 16:10](/ps#Ps.16.10); [Acts 2:24](/acts#Acts.2.24); [3:15](/acts#Acts.3.15); [Rom. 8:11](/rom#Rom.8.11); [Eph. 1:20](/eph#Eph.1.20); [Col. 2:12](/col#Col.2.12); [Heb. 13:20](/heb#Heb.13.20)); (2) of Christ himself ([John 2:19](/john#John.2.19); [10:18](/john#John.10.18)); and (3) of the Holy Spirit ([1 Peter 3:18](/1pet#1Pet.3.18)).

 The resurrection is a public testimony of Christ’s release from his undertaking as surety, and an evidence of the Father’s acceptance of his work of redemption. It is a victory over death and the grave for all his followers.

 The importance of Christ’s resurrection will be seen when we consider that if he rose the gospel is true, and if he rose not it is false. His resurrection from the dead makes it manifest that his sacrifice was accepted. Our justification was secured by his obedience to the death, and therefore he was raised from the dead ([Rom. 4:25](/rom#Rom.4.25)). His resurrection is a proof that he made a full atonement for our sins, that his sacrifice was accepted as a satisfaction to divine justice, and his blood a ransom for sinners. It is also a pledge and an earnest of the resurrection of all believers ([Rom. 8:11](/rom#Rom.8.11); [1 Cor. 6:14](/1cor#1Cor.6.14); [15:47-49](/1cor#1Cor.15.47); [Phil. 3:21](/phil#Phil.3.21); [1 John 3:2](/1john#1John.3.2)). As he lives, they shall live also.

 It proved him to be the Son of God, inasmuch as it authenticated all his claims ([John 2:19](/john#John.2.19); [10:17](/john#John.10.17)). “If Christ did not rise, the whole scheme of redemption is a failure, and all the predictions and anticipations of its glorious results for time and for eternity, for men and for angels of every rank and order, are proved to be chimeras. ‘But now is Christ risen from the dead, and become the first-fruits of them that slept.’ Therefore the Bible is true from Genesis to Revelation. The kingdom of darkness has been overthrown, Satan has fallen as lightning from heaven, and the triumph of truth over error, of good over evil, of happiness over misery is for ever secured.” Hodge.

 With reference to the report which the Roman soldiers were bribed ([Matt. 28:12-14](/matt#Matt.28.12)) to circulate concerning Christ’s resurrection, “his disciples came by night and stole him away while we slept,” Matthew Henry in his “Commentary,” under [John 20:1-10](/john#John.20.1), fittingly remarks, “The grave-clothes in which Christ had been buried were found in very good order, which serves for an evidence that his body was not ‘stolen away while men slept.’ Robbers of tombs have been known to take away ‘the clothes’ and leave the body; but none ever took away ‘the body’ and left the clothes, especially when they were ‘fine linen’ and new ([Mark 15:46](/mark#Mark.15.46)). Any one would rather choose to carry a dead body in its clothes than naked. Or if they that were supposed to have stolen it would have left the grave-clothes behind, yet it cannot be supposed they would find leisure to ‘fold up the linen.’”",11.0,unmatched,unmatched,,
Resurrection of the dead,5218,r-p147.4,Resurrection of the dead,"Will be simultaneous both of the just and the unjust ([Dan. 12:2](/dan#Dan.12.2); [John 5:28](/john#John.5.28), [29](/john#John.5.29); [Rom. 2:6-16](/rom#Rom.2.6); [2 Thess. 1:6-10](/2thess#2Thess.1.6)). The qualities of the resurrection body will be different from those of the body laid in the grave ([1 Cor. 15:53](/1cor#1Cor.15.53), [54](/1cor#1Cor.15.54); [Phil. 3:21](/phil#Phil.3.21)); but its identity will nevertheless be preserved. It will still be the same body ([1 Cor. 15:42-44](/1cor#1Cor.15.42)) which rises again.

 As to the nature of the resurrection body, (1) it will be spiritual ([1 Cor. 15:44](/1cor#1Cor.15.44)), i.e., a body adapted to the use of the soul in its glorified state, and to all the conditions of the heavenly state; (2) glorious, incorruptible, and powerful (54); (3) like unto the glorified body of Christ ([Phil. 3:21](/phil#Phil.3.21)); and (4) immortal ([Rev. 21:4](/rev#Rev.21.4)).

This tribe united with that of Gad in asking permission to settle in the “land of Gilead,” “on the other side of Jordan” (32:1-5). The lot assigned to Reuben was the smallest of the lots given to the trans-Jordanic tribes. It extended from the Arnon, in the south along the coast of the Dead Sea to its northern end, where the Jordan flows into it ([Josh. 13:15-21](/josh#Josh.13.15), [23](/josh#Josh.13.23)).

Reuben is “to the eastern tribes what Simeon is to the western. ‘Unstable as water,’ he vanishes away into a mere Arabian tribe. ‘His men are few;’ it is all he can do ‘to live and not die.’ We hear of nothing beyond the multiplication of their cattle in the land of Gilead, their spoils of ‘camels fifty thousand, and of asses two thousand’ ([1 Chr. 5:9](/1chr#1Chr.5.9), [10](/1chr#1Chr.5.10), [20](/1chr#1Chr.5.20), [21](/1chr#1Chr.5.21)).

"Revelation, Book of",5230,r-p156.1,"Revelation, Book of","'=The Apocalypse, the closing book and the only prophetical book of the New Testament canon. The author of this book was undoubtedly John the apostle. His name occurs four times in the book itself (1:1, 4, 9; 22:8), and there is every reason to conclude that the “John” here mentioned was the apostle. In a manuscript of about the twelfth century he is called “John the divine,” but no reason can be assigned for this appellation.

 The date of the writing of this book has generally been fixed at A.D. 96, in the reign of Domitian. There are some, however, who contend for an earlier date, A.D. 68 or 69, in the reign of Nero. Those who are in favour of the later date appeal to the testimony of the Christian father Irenaeus, who received information relative to this book from those who had seen John face to face. He says that the Apocalypse “was seen no long time ago.”

 As to the relation between this book and the Gospel of John, it has been well observed that “the leading ideas of both are the same. The one gives us in a magnificent vision, the other in a great historic drama, the supreme conflict between good and evil and its issue. In both Jesus Christ is the central figure, whose victory through defeat is the issue of the conflict. In both the Jewish dispensation is the preparation for the gospel, and the warfare and triumph of the Christ is described in language saturated with the Old Testament.

In less than two hours a dry desert wady upwards of 300 yards broad was turned into a foaming torrent from 8 to 10 feet deep, roaring and tearing down and bearing everything upon it, tangled masses of tamarisks, hundreds of beautiful palmtrees, scores of sheep and goats, camels and donkeys, and even men, women, and children, for a whole encampment of Arabs was washed away a few miles above me. The storm commenced at five in the evening; at half-past nine the waters were rapidly subsiding, and it was evident that the flood had spent its force.” (Comp.

 It happened that a grievous famine, which lasted for three years, fell upon the land during the earlier half of David’s reign at Jerusalem. This calamity was sent “for Saul and for his bloody house, because he slew the Gibeonites.” David inquired of the Gibeonites what satisfaction they demanded, and was answered that nothing would compensate for the wrong Saul had done to them but the death of seven of Saul’s sons. David accordingly delivered up to them the two sons of Rizpah and five of the sons of Merab (q.v.), Saul’s eldest daughter, whom she bore to Adriel. These the Gibeonites put to death, and hung up their bodies before the Lord at the sanctuary at Gibeah. Rizpah thereupon took her place on the rock of Gibeah (q.v.), and for five months watched the suspended bodies of her children, to prevent them from being devoured by the beasts and birds of prey, till they were at length taken down and buried by David.

"Romans, Epistle to the",5277,r-p207.3,"Romans, Epistle to the","This epistle was probably written at Corinth. Phoebe ([Rom. 16:1](/rom#Rom.16.1)) of Cenchrea conveyed it to Rome, and Gaius of Corinth entertained the apostle at the time of his writing it (16:23; [1 Cor. 1:14](/1cor#1Cor.1.14)), and Erastus was chamberlain of the city, i.e., of Corinth ([2 Tim. 4:20](/2tim#2Tim.4.20)).

 The precise time at which it was written is not mentioned in the epistle, but it was obviously written when the apostle was about to “go unto Jerusalem to minister unto the saints”, i.e., at the close of his second visit to Greece, during the winter preceding his last visit to that city ([Rom. 15:25](/rom#Rom.15.25); comp. [Acts 19:21](/acts#Acts.19.21); [20:2](/acts#Acts.20.2), [3](/acts#Acts.20.3), [16](/acts#Acts.20.16); [1 Cor. 16:1-4](/1cor#1Cor.16.1)), early in A.D. 58.

 It is highly probable that Christianity was planted in Rome by some of those who had been at Jerusalem on the day of Pentecost ([Acts 2:10](/acts#Acts.2.10)). At this time the Jews were very numerous in Rome, and their synagogues were probably resorted to by Romans also, who in this way became acquainted with the great facts regarding Jesus as these were reported among the Jews. Thus a church composed of both Jews and Gentiles was formed at Rome. Many of the brethren went out to meet Paul on his approach to Rome. There are evidences that Christians were then in Rome in considerable numbers, and had probably more than one place of meeting ([Rom. 16:14](/rom#Rom.16.14), [15](/rom#Rom.16.15)).

 The object of the apostle in writing to this church was to explain to them the great doctrines of the gospel. His epistle was a “word in season.” Himself deeply impressed with a sense of the value of the doctrines of salvation, he opens up in a clear and connected form the whole system of the gospel in its relation both to Jew and Gentile. This epistle is peculiar in this, that it is a systematic exposition of the gospel of universal application. The subject is here treated argumentatively, and is a plea for Gentiles addressed to Jews. In the Epistle to the Galatians, the same subject is discussed, but there the apostle pleads his own authority, because the church in Galatia had been founded by him.

 After the introduction (1:1-15), the apostle presents in it divers aspects and relations the doctrine of justification by faith (1:16-11:36) on the ground of the imputed righteousness of Christ. He shows that salvation is all of grace, and only of grace. This main section of his letter is followed by various practical exhortations (12:1-15:13), which are followed by a conclusion containing personal explanations and salutations, which contain the names of twenty-four Christians at Rome, a benediction, and a doxology ([Rom. 15:14](/rom#Rom.15.14)-ch. 16).",0.0,unmatched,unmatched,,
Rome,5278,r-p212.2,Rome,"The most celebrated city in the world at the time of Christ. It is said to have been founded B.C. 753.

It was distinguished for its wealth and luxury and profligacy. The empire of which it was the capital had then reached its greatest prosperity.

 On the day of Pentecost there were in Jerusalem “strangers from Rome,” who doubtless carried with them back to Rome tidings of that great day, and were instrumental in founding the church there. Paul was brought to this city a prisoner, where he remained for two years ([Acts 28:30](/acts#Acts.28.30), [31](/acts#Acts.28.31)) “in his own hired house.” While here, Paul wrote his epistles to the Philippians, to the Ephesians, to the Colossians, to Philemon, and probably also to the Hebrews. He had during these years for companions Luke and Aristarchus ([Acts 27:2](/acts#Acts.27.2)), Timothy ([Phil. 1:1](/phil#Phil.1.1); [Col. 1:1](/col#Col.1.1)), Tychicus ([Eph. 6](/eph#Eph.6): 21), Epaphroditus ([Phil. 4:18](/phil#Phil.4.18)), and John Mark ([Col. 4:10](/col#Col.4.10)).

 Beneath this city are extensive galleries, called “catacombs,” which were used from about the time of the apostles (one of the inscriptions found in them bears the date A.D. 71) for some three hundred years as places of refuge in the time of persecution, and also of worship and burial.

It is first mentioned as having been instituted in Paradise, when man was in innocence ([Gen. 2:2](/gen#Gen.2.2)). “The sabbath was made for man,” as a day of rest and refreshment for the body and of blessing to the soul.

 It is next referred to in connection with the gift of manna to the children of Israel in the wilderness ([Ex. 16:23](/exod#Exod.16.23)); and afterwards, when the law was given from Sinai (20:11), the people were solemnly charged to “remember the sabbath day, to keep it holy.” Thus it is spoken of as an institution already existing.

 In the Mosaic law strict regulations were laid down regarding its observance ([Ex. 35:2](/exod#Exod.35.2), [3](/exod#Exod.35.3); [Lev. 23:3](/lev#Lev.23.3); [26:34](/lev#Lev.26.34)). These were peculiar to that dispensation.

 In the subsequent history of the Jews frequent references are made to the sanctity of the Sabbath ([Isa. 56:2](/isa#Isa.56.2), [4](/isa#Isa.56.4), [6](/isa#Isa.56.6), [7](/isa#Isa.56.7); 58:13, 14; [Jer. 17:20-22](/jer#Jer.17.20); [Neh. 13:19](/neh#Neh.13.19)). In later times they perverted the Sabbath by their traditions. Our Lord rescued it from their perversions, and recalled to them its true nature and intent ([Matt. 12:10-13](/matt#Matt.12.10); [Mark 2:27](/mark#Mark.2.27); [Luke 13:10-17](/luke#Luke.13.10)).

 The Sabbath, originally instituted for man at his creation, is of permanent and universal obligation. The physical necessities of man require a Sabbath of rest. He is so constituted that his bodily welfare needs at least one day in seven for rest from ordinary labour. Experience also proves that the moral and spiritual necessities of men also demand a Sabbath of rest. “I am more and more sure by experience that the reason for the observance of the Sabbath lies deep in the everlasting necessities of human nature, and that as long as man is man the blessedness of keeping it, not as a day of rest only, but as a day of spiritual rest, will never be annulled. I certainly do feel by experience the eternal obligation, because of the eternal necessity, of the Sabbath. The soul withers without it. It thrives in proportion to its observance. The Sabbath was made for man. God made it for men in a certain spiritual state because they needed it. The need, therefore, is deeply hidden in human nature. He who can dispense with it must be holy and spiritual indeed. And he who, still unholy and unspiritual, would yet dispense with it is a man that would fain be wiser than his Maker” (F. W. Robertson).

 The ancient Babylonian calendar, as seen from recently recovered inscriptions on the bricks among the ruins of the royal palace, was based on the division of time into weeks of seven days. The Sabbath is in these inscriptions designated Sabattu, and defined as “a day of rest for the heart” and “a day of completion of labour.”

 The change of the day. Originally at creation the seventh day of the week was set apart and consecrated as the Sabbath. The first day of the week is now observed as the Sabbath. Has God authorized this change? There is an obvious distinction between the Sabbath as an institution and the particular day set apart for its observance. The question, therefore, as to the change of the day in no way affects the perpetual obligation of the Sabbath as an institution. Change of the day or no change, the Sabbath remains as a sacred institution the same. It cannot be abrogated.

 If any change of the day has been made, it must have been by Christ or by his authority. Christ has a right to make such a change ([Mark 2:23-28](/mark#Mark.2.23)). As Creator, Christ was the original Lord of the Sabbath ([John 1:3](/john#John.1.3); [Heb. 1:10](/heb#Heb.1.10)). It was originally a memorial of creation. A work vastly greater than that of creation has now been accomplished by him, the work of redemption. We would naturally expect just such a change as would make the Sabbath a memorial of that greater work.

 True, we can give no text authorizing the change in so many words. We have no express law declaring the change. But there are evidences of another kind. We know for a fact that the first day of the week has been observed from apostolic times, and the necessary conclusion is, that it was observed by the apostles and their immediate disciples. This, we may be sure, they never would have done without the permission or the authority of their Lord.

 After his resurrection, which took place on the first day of the week ([Matt. 28:1](/matt#Matt.28.1); [Mark 16:2](/mark#Mark.16.2); [Luke 24:1](/luke#Luke.24.1); [John 20:1](/john#John.20.1)), we never find Christ meeting with his disciples on the seventh day. But he specially honoured the first day by manifesting himself to them on four separate occasions ([Matt. 28:9](/matt#Matt.28.9); [Luke 24:34](/luke#Luke.24.34), [18](/luke#Luke.24.18)-33; [John 20:19-23](/john#John.20.19)). Again, on the next first day of the week, Jesus appeared to his disciples ([John 20:26](/john#John.20.26)).

 Some have calculated that Christ’s ascension took place on the first day of the week. And there can be no doubt that the descent of the Holy Ghost at Pentecost was on that day ([Acts 2:1](/acts#Acts.2.1)). Thus Christ appears as instituting a new day to be observed by his people as the Sabbath, a day to be henceforth known amongst them as the “Lord’s day.” The observance of this “Lord’s day” as the Sabbath was the general custom of the primitive churches, and must have had apostolic sanction (comp. [Acts 20:3-7](/acts#Acts.20.3); [1 Cor. 16:1](/1cor#1Cor.16.1), [2](/1cor#1Cor.16.2)) and authority, and so the sanction and authority of Jesus Christ.

Sacrifice,5305,s-p23.9,Sacrifice,"The offering up of sacrifices is to be regarded as a divine institution. It did not originate with man. God himself appointed it as the mode in which acceptable worship was to be offered to him by guilty man. The language and the idea of sacrifice pervade the whole Bible.

 Sacrifices were offered in the ante-diluvian age. The Lord clothed Adam and Eve with the skins of animals, which in all probability had been offered in sacrifice ([Gen. 3:21](/gen#Gen.3.21)). Abel offered a sacrifice “of the firstlings of his flock” (4:4; [Heb. 11:4](/heb#Heb.11.4)). A distinction also was made between clean and unclean animals, which there is every reason to believe had reference to the offering up of sacrifices ([Gen. 7:2](/gen#Gen.7.2), [8](/gen#Gen.7.8)), because animals were not given to man as food till after the Flood.

 The same practice is continued down through the patriarchal age ([Gen. 8:20](/gen#Gen.8.20); [12:7](/gen#Gen.12.7); [13:4](/gen#Gen.13.4), [18](/gen#Gen.13.18); [15:9-11](/gen#Gen.15.9); [22:1-18](/gen#Gen.22.1), etc.). In the Mosaic period of Old Testament history definite laws were prescribed by God regarding the different kinds of sacrifices that were to be offered and the manner in which the offering was to be made. The offering of stated sacrifices became indeed a prominent and distinctive feature of the whole period ([Ex. 12:3-27](/exod#Exod.12.3); [Lev. 23:5-8](/lev#Lev.23.5); [Num. 9:2-14](/num#Num.9.2)).

 We learn from the Epistle to the Hebrews that sacrifices had in themselves no value or efficacy. They were only the “shadow of good things to come,” and pointed the worshippers forward to the coming of the great High Priest, who, in the fullness of the time, “was offered once for all to bear the sin of many.” Sacrifices belonged to a temporary economy, to a system of types and emblems which served their purposes and have now passed away. The “one sacrifice for sins” hath “perfected for ever them that are sanctified.”

 Sacrifices were of two kinds: 1. Unbloody, such as (1) first-fruits and tithes; (2) meat and drink-offerings; and (3) incense. 2. Bloody, such as (1) burnt-offerings; (2) peace-offerings; and (3) sin and trespass offerings.",0.0,unmatched,unmatched,,
Sadducees,5306,s-p28.2,Sadducees,"The origin of this Jewish sect cannot definitely be traced. It was probably the outcome of the influence of Grecian customs and philosophy during the period of Greek domination. The first time they are met with is in connection with John the Baptist’s ministry. They came out to him when on the banks of the Jordan, and he said to them, “O generation of vipers, who hath warned you to flee from the wrath to come?” ([Matt. 3:7](/matt#Matt.3.7).) The next time they are spoken of they are represented as coming to our Lord tempting him. He calls them “hypocrites” and “a wicked and adulterous generation” ([Matt. 16:1-4](/matt#Matt.16.1); [22:23](/matt#Matt.22.23)). The only reference to them in the Gospels of Mark (12:18-27) and Luke (20:27-38) is their attempting to ridicule the doctrine of the resurrection, which they denied, as they also denied the existence of angels. They are never mentioned in John’s Gospel.

 There were many Sadducees among the “elders” of the Sanhedrin. They seem, indeed, to have been as numerous as the Pharisees ([Acts 23:6](/acts#Acts.23.6)). They showed their hatred of Jesus in taking part in his condemnation ([Matt. 16:21](/matt#Matt.16.21); [26:1-3](/matt#Matt.26.1), [59](/matt#Matt.26.59); [Mark 8:31](/mark#Mark.8.31); [15:1](/mark#Mark.15.1); [Luke 9:22](/luke#Luke.9.22); [22:66](/luke#Luke.22.66)).

 A “covenant of salt” ([Num. 18:19](/num#Num.18.19); [2 Chr. 13:5](/2chr#2Chr.13.5)) was a covenant of perpetual obligation. New-born children were rubbed with salt ([Ezek. 16:4](/ezek#Ezek.16.4)).

Samaria,5334,s-p59.5,Samaria,"A watch-mountain or a watch-tower. In the heart of the mountains of Israel, a few miles north-west of Shechem, stands the “hill of Shomeron,” a solitary mountain, a great “mamelon.” It is an oblong hill, with steep but not inaccessible sides, and a long flat top. Omri, the king of Israel, purchased this hill from Shemer its owner for two talents of silver, and built on its broad summit the city to which he gave the name of “Shomeron”, i.e., Samaria, as the new capital of his kingdom instead of Tirzah ([1 Kings 16:24](/1kgs#1Kgs.16.24)). As such it possessed many advantages. Here Omri resided during the last six years of his reign. As the result of an unsuccessful war with Syria, he appears to have been obliged to grant to the Syrians the right to “make streets in Samaria”, i.e., probably permission to the Syrian merchants to carry on their trade in the Israelite capital. This would imply the existence of a considerable Syrian population. “It was the only great city of Palestine created by the sovereign. All the others had been already consecrated by patriarchal tradition or previous possession. But Samaria was the choice of Omri alone. He, indeed, gave to the city which he had built the name of its former owner, but its especial connection with himself as its founder is proved by the designation which it seems Samaria bears in Assyrian inscriptions, Beth-khumri (‘the house or palace of Omri’).”, Stanley.

 Samaria was frequently besieged. In the days of Ahab, Benhadad II. came up against it with thirty-two vassal kings, but was defeated with a great slaughter ([1 Kings 20:1-21](/1kgs#1Kgs.20.1)). A second time, next year, he assailed it; but was again utterly routed, and was compelled to surrender to Ahab (20:28-34), whose army, as compared with that of Benhadad, was no more than “two little flocks of kids.”

 In the days of Jehoram this Benhadad again laid siege to Samaria, during which the city was reduced to the direst extremities. But just when success seemed to be within their reach, they suddenly broke up the seige, alarmed by a mysterious noise of chariots and horses and a great army, and fled, leaving their camp with all its contents behind them. The famishing inhabitants of the city were soon relieved with the abundance of the spoil of the Syrian camp; and it came to pass, according to the word of Elisha, that “a measure of fine flour was sold for a shekel, and two measures of barely for a shekel, in the gates of Samaria” ([2 Kings 7:1-20](/2kgs#2Kgs.7.1)).

 Shalmaneser invaded Israel in the days of Hoshea, and reduced it to vassalage. He laid siege to Samaria (B.C. 723), which held out for three years, and was at length captured by Sargon, who completed the conquest Shalmaneser had begun ([2 Kings 18:9-12](/2kgs#2Kgs.18.9); [17:3](/2kgs#2Kgs.17.3)), and removed vast numbers of the tribes into captivity.

 This city, after passing through various vicissitudes, was given by the emperor Augustus to Herod the Great, who rebuilt it, and called it Sebaste (Gr. form of Augustus) in honour of the emperor. In the New Testament the only mention of it is in [Acts 8:5-14](/acts#Acts.8.5), where it is recorded that Philip went down to the city of Samaria and preached there.

 It is now represented by the hamlet of Sebustieh, containing about three hundred inhabitants. The ruins of the ancient town are all scattered over the hill, down the sides of which they have rolled. The shafts of about one hundred of what must have been grand Corinthian columns are still standing, and attract much attention, although nothing definite is known regarding them. (Comp. [Micah 1:6](/mic#Mic.1.6).)

 In the time of Christ, Western Palestine was divided into three provinces, Judea, Samaria, and Galilee. Samaria occupied the centre of Palestine ([John 4:4](/john#John.4.4)). It is called in the Talmud the “land of the Cuthim,” and is not regarded as a part of the Holy Land at all.

 It may be noticed that the distance between Samaria and Jerusalem, the respective capitals of the two kingdoms, is only 35 miles in a direct line.",0.0,place,samaria_1022,,"samaria_1022,samarias_1023"
Samaritan Pentateuch,5335,s-p67.1,Samaritan Pentateuch,"On the return from the Exile, the Jews refused the Samaritans participation with them in the worship at Jerusalem, and the latter separated from all fellowship with them, and built a temple for themselves on Mount Gerizim. This temple was razed to the ground more than one hundred years B.C. Then a system of worship was instituted similar to that of the temple at Jerusalem. It was founded on the Law, copies of which had been multiplied in Israel as well as in Judah. Thus the Pentateuch was preserved among the Samaritans, although they never called it by this name, but always “the Law,” which they read as one book. The division into five books, as we now have it, however, was adopted by the Samaritans, as it was by the Jews, in all their priests’ copies of “the Law,” for the sake of convenience. This was the only portion of the Old Testament which was accepted by the Samaritans as of divine authority.

 The form of the letters in the manuscript copies of the Samaritan Pentateuch is different from that of the Hebrew copies, and is probably the same as that which was in general use before the Captivity. There are other peculiarities in the writing which need not here be specified.

 There are important differences between the Hebrew and the Samaritan copies of the Pentateuch in the readings of many sentences. In about two thousand instances in which the Samaritan and the Jewish texts differ, the LXX. agrees with the former. The New Testament also, when quoting from the Old Testament, agrees as a rule with the Samaritan text, where that differs from the Jewish. Thus [Ex. 12:40](/exod#Exod.12.40) in the Samaritan reads, “Now the sojourning of the children of Israel and of their fathers which they had dwelt in the land of Canaan and in Egypt was four hundred and thirty years” (comp.

Samaritans,5336,s-p70.3,Samaritans,"The name given to the new and mixed inhabitants whom Esarhaddon (B.C. 677), the king of Assyria, brought from Babylon and other places and settled in the cities of Samaria, instead of the original inhabitants whom Sargon (B.C. 721) had removed into captivity ([2 Kings 17:24](/2kgs#2Kgs.17.24); comp. [Ezra 4:2](/ezra#Ezra.4.2), [9](/ezra#Ezra.4.9), [10](/ezra#Ezra.4.10)). These strangers (comp. [Luke 17:18](/luke#Luke.17.18)) amalgamated with the Jews still remaining in the land, and gradually abandoned their old idolatry and adopted partly the Jewish religion.

 After the return from the Captivity, the Jews in Jerusalem refused to allow them to take part with them in rebuilding the temple, and hence sprang up an open enmity between them. They erected a rival temple on Mount Gerizim, which was, however, destroyed by a Jewish king (B.C. 130). They then built another at Shechem. The bitter enmity between the Jews and Samaritans continued in the time of our Lord: the Jews had “no dealings with the Samaritans” ([John 4:9](/john#John.4.9); comp. [Luke 9:52](/luke#Luke.9.52), [53](/luke#Luke.9.53)). Our Lord was in contempt called “a Samaritan” ([John 8:48](/john#John.8.48)).

Samson,5340,s-p75.2,Samson,"Of the sun, the son of Manoah, born at Zorah. The narrative of his life is given in [Judg. 13](/judg#Judg.13)-16. He was a “Nazarite unto God” from his birth, the first Nazarite mentioned in Scripture ([Judg. 13:3-5](/judg#Judg.13.3); comp. [Num. 6:1-21](/num#Num.6.1)). The first recorded event of his life was his marriage with a Philistine woman of Timnath ([Judg. 14:1-5](/judg#Judg.14.1)). Such a marriage was not forbidden by the law of Moses, as the Philistines did not form one of the seven doomed Canaanite nations ([Ex. 34:11-16](/exod#Exod.34.11); [Deut. 7:1-4](/deut#Deut.7.1)). It was, however, an ill-assorted and unblessed marriage. His wife was soon taken from him and given “to his companion” ([Judg. 14:20](/judg#Judg.14.20)). For this Samson took revenge by burning the “standing corn of the Philistines” (15:1-8), who, in their turn, in revenge “burnt her and her father with fire.” Her death he terribly avenged (15:7-19). During the twenty years following this he judged Israel; but we have no record of his life. Probably these twenty years may have been simultaneous with the last twenty years of Eli’s life. After this we have an account of his exploits at Gaza (16:1-3), and of his infatuation for Delilah, and her treachery (16:4-20), and then of his melancholy death (16:21-31). He perished in the last terrible destruction he brought upon his enemies. “So the dead which he slew at his death were more [in social and political importance=the elite of the people] than they which he slew in his life.”

 “Straining all his nerves, he bowed:  As with the force of winds and waters pent,  When mountains tremble, those two massy pillars  With horrible convulsion to and fro  He tugged, he shook, till down they came, and drew  The whole roof after them, with burst of thunder  Upon the heads of all who sat beneath,  Lords, ladies, captains, counsellors, or priests,  Their choice nobility and flower.”  Milton’s Samson Agonistes.",0.0,person,samson_2468,samson_2468,
Samuel,5341,s-p77.1,Samuel,"Heard of God. The peculiar circumstances connected with his birth are recorded in [1 Sam. 1:20](/1sam#1Sam.1.20). Hannah, one of the two wives of Elkanah, who came up to Shiloh to worship before the Lord, earnestly prayed to God that she might become the mother of a son. Her prayer was graciously granted; and after the child was weaned she brought him to Shiloh nd consecrated him to the Lord as a perpetual Nazarite (1:23-2:11). Here his bodily wants and training were attended to by the women who served in the tabernacle, while Eli cared for his religious culture. Thus, probably, twelve years of his life passed away. “The child Samuel grew on, and was in favour both with the Lord, and also with men” (2:26; comp. [Luke 2:52](/luke#Luke.2.52)). It was a time of great and growing degeneracy in Israel ([Judg. 21:19-21](/judg#Judg.21.19); [1 Sam. 2:12-17](/1sam#1Sam.2.12), [22](/1sam#1Sam.2.22)). The Philistines, who of late had greatly increased in number and in power, were practically masters of the country, and kept the people in subjection ([1 Sam. 10:5](/1sam#1Sam.10.5); [13:3](/1sam#1Sam.13.3)).

 At this time new communications from God began to be made to the pious child. A mysterious voice came to him in the night season, calling him by name, and, instructed by Eli, he answered, “Speak, Lord; for thy servant heareth.” The message that came from the Lord was one of woe and ruin to Eli and his profligate sons. Samuel told it all to Eli, whose only answer to the terrible denunciations ([1 Sam. 3:11-18](/1sam#1Sam.3.11)) was, “It is the Lord; let him do what seemeth him good”, the passive submission of a weak character, not, in his case, the expression of the highest trust and faith. The Lord revealed himself now in divers manners to Samuel, and his fame and his influence increased throughout the land as of one divinely called to the prophetical office. A new period in the history of the kingdom of God now commenced.

 The Philistine yoke was heavy, and the people, groaning under the wide-spread oppression, suddenly rose in revolt, and “went out against the Philistines to battle.” A fierce and disastrous battle was fought at Aphek, near to Ebenezer ([1 Sam. 4:1](/1sam#1Sam.4.1), [2](/1sam#1Sam.4.2)). The Israelites were defeated, leaving 4,000 dead “in the field.” The chiefs of the people thought to repair this great disaster by carrying with them the ark of the covenant as the symbol of Jehovah’s presence. They accordingly, without consulting Samuel, fetched it out of Shiloh to the camp near Aphek. At the sight of the ark among them the people “shouted with a great shout, so that the earth rang again.” A second battle was fought, and again the Philistines defeated the Israelites, stormed their camp, slew 30,000 men, and took the sacred ark. The tidings of this fatal battle was speedily conveyed to Shiloh; and so soon as the aged Eli heard that the ark of God was taken, he fell backward from his seat at the entrance of the sanctuary, and his neck brake, and he died. The tabernacle with its furniture was probably, by the advice of Samuel, now about twenty years of age, removed from Shiloh to some place of safety, and finally to Nob, where it remained many years (21:1).

 The Philistines followed up their advantage, and marched upon Shiloh, which they plundered and destroyed (comp. [Jer. 7:12](/jer#Jer.7.12); [Ps. 78:59](/ps#Ps.78.59)). This was a great epoch in the history of Israel. For twenty years after this fatal battle at Aphek the whole land lay under the oppression of the Philistines. During all these dreary years Samuel was a spiritual power in the land. From Ramah, his native place, where he resided, his influence went forth on every side among the people. With unwearied zeal he went up and down from place to place, reproving, rebuking, and exhorting the people, endeavouring to awaken in them a sense of their sinfulness, and to lead them to repentance. His labours were so far successful that “all the house of Israel lamented after the Lord.” Samuel summoned the people to Mizpeh, one of the loftiest hills in Central Palestine, where they fasted and prayed, and prepared themselves there, under his direction, for a great war against the Philistines, who now marched their whole force toward Mizpeh, in order to crush the Israelites once for all. At the intercession of Samuel God interposed in behalf of Israel. Samuel himself was their leader, the only occasion in which he acted as a leader in war. The Philistines were utterly routed. They fled in terror before the army of Israel, and a great slaughter ensued. This battle, fought probably about B.C. 1095, put an end to the forty years of Philistine oppression. In memory of this great deliverance, and in token of gratitude for the help vouchsafed, Samuel set up a great stone in the battlefield, and called it “Ebenezer,” saying, “Hitherto hath the Lord helped us” ([1 Sam. 7:1-12](/1sam#1Sam.7.1)). This was the spot where, twenty years before, the Israelites had suffered a great defeat, when the ark of God was taken.

 This victory over the Philistines was followed by a long period of peace for Israel ([1 Sam. 7:13](/1sam#1Sam.7.13), [14](/1sam#1Sam.7.14)), during which Samuel exercised the functions of judge, going “from year to year in circuit” from his home in Ramah to Bethel, thence to Gilgal (not that in the Jordan valley, but that which lay to the west of Ebal and Gerizim), and returning by Mizpeh to Ramah. He established regular services at Shiloh, where he built an altar; and at Ramah he gathered a company of young men around him and established a school of the prophets. The schools of the prophets, thus originated, and afterwards established also at Gibeah, Bethel, Gilgal, and Jericho, exercised an important influence on the national character and history of the people in maintaining pure religion in the midst of growing corruption. They continued to the end of the Jewish commonwealth.

 Many years now passed, during which Samuel exercised the functions of his judicial office, being the friend and counsellor of the people in all matters of private and public interest. He was a great statesman as well as a reformer, and all regarded him with veneration as the “seer,” the prophet of the Lord. At the close of this period, when he was now an old man, the elders of Israel came to him at Ramah ([1 Sam. 8:4](/1sam#1Sam.8.4), [5](/1sam#1Sam.8.5), [19-22](/1sam#1Sam.8.19)); and feeling how great was the danger to which the nation was exposed from the misconduct of Samuel’s sons, whom he had invested with judicial functions as his assistants, and had placed at Beersheba on the Philistine border, and also from a threatened invasion of the Ammonites, they demanded that a king should be set over them. This request was very displeasing to Samuel. He remonstrated with them, and warned them of the consequences of such a step. At length, however, referring the matter to God, he acceded to their desires, and anointed Saul (q.v.) to be their king (11:15). Before retiring from public life he convened an assembly of the people at Gilgal (ch. 12), and there solemnly addressed them with reference to his own relation to them as judge and prophet.

 The remainder of his life he spent in retirement at Ramah, only occasionally and in special circumstances appearing again in public ([1 Sam. 13](/1sam#1Sam.13), [15](/1sam#1Sam.15)) with communications from God to king Saul. While mourning over the many evils which now fell upon the nation, he is suddenly summoned (ch. 16) to go to Bethlehem and anoint David, the son of Jesse, as king over Israel instead of Saul. After this little is known of him till the time of his death, which took place at Ramah when he was probably about eighty years of age. “And all Israel gathered themselves together, and lamented him, and buried him in his house at Ramah” (25:1), not in the house itself, but in the court or garden of his house. (Comp. [2 Kings 21:18](/2kgs#2Kgs.21.18); [2 Chr. 33:20](/2chr#2Chr.33.20); [1 Kings 2:34](/1kgs#1Kgs.2.34); [John 19:41](/john#John.19.41).)

"Samuel, Books of",5342,s-p85.3,"Samuel, Books of","The LXX. translators regarded the books of Samuel and of Kings as forming one continuous history, which they divided into four books, which they called “Books of the Kingdom.” The Vulgate version followed this division, but styled them “Books of the Kings.” These books of Samuel they accordingly called the “First” and “Second” Books of Kings, and not, as in the modern Protestant versions, the “First” and “Second” Books of Samuel.

 The authors of the books of Samuel were probably Samuel, Gad, and Nathan. Samuel penned the first twenty-four chapters of the first book. Gad, the companion of David ([1 Sam. 22:5](/1sam#1Sam.22.5)), continued the history thus commenced; and Nathan completed it, probably arranging the whole in the form in which we now have it ([1 Chr. 29:29](/1chr#1Chr.29.29)).

 The contents of the books. The first book comprises a period of about a hundred years, and nearly coincides with the life of Samuel. It contains (1) the history of Eli (1-4); (2) the history of Samuel (5-12); (3) the history of Saul, and of David in exile (13-31). The second book, comprising a period of perhaps fifty years, contains a history of the reign of David (1) over Judah (1-4), and (2) over all Israel (5-24), mainly in its political aspects. The last four chapters of Second Samuel may be regarded as a sort of appendix recording various events, but not chronologically. These books do not contain complete histories.

Sanctification,5344,s-p89.3,Sanctification,"Involves more than a mere moral reformation of character, brought about by the power of the truth: it is the work of the Holy Spirit bringing the whole nature more and more under the influences of the new gracious principles implanted in the soul in regeneration. In other words, sanctification is the carrying on to perfection the work begun in regeneration, and it extends to the whole man ([Rom. 6:13](/rom#Rom.6.13); [2 Cor. 4:6](/2cor#2Cor.4.6); [Col. 3:10](/col#Col.3.10); [1 John 4:7](/1john#1John.4.7); [1 Cor. 6:19](/1cor#1Cor.6.19)). It is the special office of the Holy Spirit in the plan of redemption to carry on this work ([1 Cor. 6:11](/1cor#1Cor.6.11); [2 Thess. 2:13](/2thess#2Thess.2.13)). Faith is instrumental in securing sanctification, inasmuch as it (1) secures union to Christ ([Gal. 2:20](/gal#Gal.2.20)), and (2) brings the believer into living contact with the truth, whereby he is led to yield obedience “to the commands, trembling at the threatenings, and embracing the promises of God for this life and that which is to come.”

 Perfect sanctification is not attainable in this life ([1 Kings 8:46](/1kgs#1Kgs.8.46); [Prov. 20:9](/prov#Prov.20.9); [Eccl. 7:20](/eccl#Eccl.7.20); [James 3:2](/jas#Jas.3.2); [1 John 1:8](/1john#1John.1.8)).

The moral imperfections which cling to him he feels to be sins, which he laments and strives to overcome. Believers find that their life is a constant warfare, and they need to take the kingdom of heaven by storm, and watch while they pray. They are always subject to the constant chastisement of their Father’s loving hand, which can only be designed to correct their imperfections and to confirm their graces.

Sanhedrim,5347,s-p93.5,Sanhedrim,"More correctly Sanhedrin (Gr. synedrion), meaning “a sitting together,” or a “council.” This word (rendered “council,” A.V.) is frequently used in the New Testament ([Matt. 5:22](/matt#Matt.5.22); [26:59](/matt#Matt.26.59); [Mark 15:1](/mark#Mark.15.1), etc.) to denote the supreme judicial and administrative council of the Jews, which, it is said, was first instituted by Moses, and was composed of seventy men ([Num. 11:16](/num#Num.11.16), [17](/num#Num.11.17)). But that seems to have been only a temporary arrangement which Moses made. This council is with greater probability supposed to have originated among the Jews when they were under the domination of the Syrian kings in the time of the Maccabees. The name is first employed by the Jewish historian Josephus. This “council” is referred to simply as the “chief priests and elders of the people” ([Matt. 26:3](/matt#Matt.26.3), [47](/matt#Matt.26.47), [57](/matt#Matt.26.57), [59](/matt#Matt.26.59); 27:1, 3, 12, 20, etc.), before whom Christ was tried on the charge of claiming to be the Messiah. Peter and John were also brought before it for promulgating heresy ([Acts. 4:1-23](/acts#Acts.4.1); [5:17-41](/acts#Acts.5.17)); as was also Stephen on a charge of blasphemy (6:12-15), and Paul for violating a temple by-law (22:30; 23:1-10).

 The Sanhedrin is said to have consisted of seventy-one members, the high priest being president. They were of three classes (1) the chief priests, or heads of the twenty-four priestly courses ([1 Chr. 24](/1chr#1Chr.24)), (2) the scribes, and (3) the elders. As the highest court of judicature, “in all causes and over all persons, ecclesiastical and civil, supreme,” its decrees were binding, not only on the Jews in Palestine, but on all Jews wherever scattered abroad. Its jurisdiction was greatly curtailed by Herod, and afterwards by the Romans. Its usual place of meeting was within the precincts of the temple, in the hall “Gazith,” but it sometimes met also in the house of the high priest ([Matt. 26:3](/matt#Matt.26.3)), who was assisted by two vice-presidents.",0.0,unmatched,unmatched,,

He forthwith began a conquering career, and became one of the most powerful of the Assyrian monarchs. He is mentioned by name in the Bible only in connection with the siege of Ashdod ([Isa. 20:1](/isa#Isa.20.1)).

 At the very beginning of his reign he besieged and took the city of Samaria ([2 Kings 17:6](/2kgs#2Kgs.17.6); [18:9-12](/2kgs#2Kgs.18.9)). On an inscription found in the palace he built at Khorsabad, near Nieveh, he says, “The city of Samaria I besieged, I took; 27,280 of its inhabitants I carried away; fifty chariots that were among them I collected,” etc. The northern kingdom he changed into an Assyrian satrapy. He afterwards drove Merodach-baladan (q.v.), who kept him at bay for twelve years, out of Babylon, which he entered in triumph. By a succession of victories he gradually enlarged and consolidated the empire, which now extended from the frontiers of Egypt in the west to the mountains of Elam in the east, and thus carried almost to completion the ambitious designs of Tiglath-pileser (q.v.).

Satan,5360,s-p109.3,Satan,"Adversary; accuser. When used as a proper name, the Hebrew word so rendered has the article “the adversary” ([Job 1:6-12](/job#Job.1.6); [2:1-7](/job#Job.2.1)). In the New Testament it is used as interchangeable with Diabolos, or the devil, and is so used more than thirty times.

 He is also called “the dragon,” “the old serpent” ([Rev. 12:9](/rev#Rev.12.9); [20:2](/rev#Rev.20.2)); “the prince of this world” ([John 12:31](/john#John.12.31); [14:30](/john#John.14.30)); “the prince of the power of the air” ([Eph. 2:2](/eph#Eph.2.2)); “the god of this world” ([2 Cor. 4:4](/2cor#2Cor.4.4)); “the spirit that now worketh in the children of disobedience” ([Eph. 2:2](/eph#Eph.2.2)). The distinct personality of Satan and his activity among men are thus obviously recognized. He tempted our Lord in the wilderness ([Matt. 4:1-11](/matt#Matt.4.1)). He is “Beelzebub, the prince of the devils” (12:24). He is “the constant enemy of God, of Christ, of the divine kingdom, of the followers of Christ, and of all truth; full of falsehood and all malice, and exciting and seducing to evil in every possible way.” His power is very great in the world. He is a “roaring lion, seeking whom he may devour” ([1 Pet. 5:8](/1pet#1Pet.5.8)). Men are said to be “taken captive by him” ([2 Tim. 2:26](/2tim#2Tim.2.26)). Christians are warned against his “devices” ([2 Cor. 2:11](/2cor#2Cor.2.11)), and called on to “resist” him ([James 4:7](/jas#Jas.4.7)).

Saul 2,5364,s-p112.4,Saul,"The son of Kish (probably his only son, and a child of prayer, “asked for”), of the tribe of Benjamin, the first king of the Jewish nation. The singular providential circumstances connected with his election as king are recorded in [1 Sam. 8](/1sam#1Sam.8)-10. His father’s she-asses had strayed, and Saul was sent with a servant to seek for them. Leaving his home at Gibeah (10:5, “the hill of God,” A.V.; lit., as in R.V. marg., “Gibeah of God”), Saul and his servant went toward the north-west over Mount Ephraim, and then turning north-east they came to “the land of Shalisha,” and thence eastward to the land of Shalim, and at length came to the district of Zuph, near Samuel’s home at Ramah (9:5-10). At this point Saul proposed to return from the three days’ fruitless search, but his servant suggested that they should first consult the “seer.” Hearing that he was about to offer sacrifice, the two hastened into Ramah, and “behold, Samuel came out against them,” on his way to the “bamah”, i.e., the “height”, where sacrifice was to be offered; and in answer to Saul’s question, “Tell me, I pray thee, where the seer’s house is,” Samuel made himself known to him. Samuel had been divinely prepared for his coming (9:15-17), and received Saul as his guest. He took him with him to the sacrifice, and then after the feast “communed with Saul upon the top of the house” of all that was in his heart. On the morrow Samuel “took a vial of oil and poured it on his head,” and anointed Saul as king over Israel (9:25-10:8), giving him three signs in confirmation of his call to be king. When Saul reached his home in Gibeah the last of these signs was fulfilled, and the Sprit of God came upon him, and “he was turned into another man.” The simple countryman was transformed into the king of Israel, a remarkable change suddenly took place in his whole demeanour, and the people said in their astonishment, as they looked on the stalwart son of Kish, “Is Saul also among the prophets?”, a saying which passed into a “proverb.” (Comp. 19:24.)

 The intercourse between Saul and Samuel was as yet unknown to the people. The “anointing” had been in secret. But now the time had come when the transaction must be confirmed by the nation. Samuel accordingly summoned the people to a solemn assembly “before the Lord” at Mizpeh. Here the lot was drawn (10:17-27), and it fell upon Saul, and when he was presented before them, the stateliest man in all Israel, the air was rent for the first time in Israel by the loud cry, “God save the king!” He now returned to his home in Gibeah, attended by a kind of bodyguard, “a band of men whose hearts God had touched.” On reaching his home he dismissed them, and resumed the quiet toils of his former life.

 Soon after this, on hearing of the conduct of Nahash the Ammonite at Jabeshgilead (q.v.), an army out of all the tribes of Israel rallied at his summons to the trysting-place at Bezek, and he led them forth a great army to battle, gaining a complete victory over the Ammonite invaders at Jabesh (11:1-11). Amid the universal joy occasioned by this victory he was now fully recognized as the king of Israel. At the invitation of Samuel “all the people went to Gilgal, and there they made Saul king before the Lord in Gilgal.” Samuel now officially anointed him as king (11:15). Although Samuel never ceased to be a judge in Israel, yet now his work in that capacity practically came to an end.

 Saul now undertook the great and difficult enterprise of freeing the land from its hereditary enemies the Philistines, and for this end he gathered together an army of 3,000 men ([1 Sam. 13:1](/1sam#1Sam.13.1), [2](/1sam#1Sam.13.2)). The Philistines were encamped at Geba. Saul, with 2,000 men, occupied Michmash and Mount Bethel; while his son Jonathan, with 1,000 men, occupied Gibeah, to the south of Geba, and seemingly without any direction from his father “smote” the Philistines in Geba. Thus roused, the Philistines, who gathered an army of 30,000 chariots and 6,000 horsemen, and “people as the sand which is on the sea-shore in multitude,” encamped in Michmash, which Saul had evacuated for Gilgal. Saul now tarried for seven days in Gilgal before making any movement, as Samuel had appointed (10:8); but becoming impatient on the seventh day, as it was drawing to a close, when he had made an end of offering the burnt offering, Samuel appeared and warned him of the fatal consequences of his act of disobedience, for he had not waited long enough (13:13, 14).

 When Saul, after Samuel’s departure, went out from Gilgal with his 600 men, his followers having decreased to that number (13:15), against the Philistines at Michmash (q.v.), he had his head-quarters under a pomegrante tree at Migron, over against Michmash, the Wady esSuweinit alone intervening. Here at Gibeah-Geba Saul and his army rested, uncertain what to do. Jonathan became impatient, and with his armour-bearer planned an assault against the Philistines, unknown to Saul and the army (14:1-15). Jonathan and his armour-bearer went down into the wady, and on their hands and knees climbed to the top of the narrow rocky ridge called Bozez, where was the outpost of the Philistine army. They surprised and then slew twenty of the Philistines, and immediately the whole host of the Philistines was thrown into disorder and fled in great terror. “It was a very great trembling;” a supernatural panic seized the host. Saul and his 600 men, a band which speedily increased to 10,000, perceiving the confusion, pursued the army of the Philistines, and the tide of battle rolled on as far as to Bethaven, halfway between Michmash and Bethel. The Philistines were totally routed. “So the Lord saved Israel that day.” While pursuing the Philistines, Saul rashly adjured the people, saying, “Cursed be the man that eateth any food until evening.” But though faint and weary, the Israelites “smote the Philistines that day from Michmash to Aijalon” (a distance of from 15 to 20 miles). Jonathan had, while passing through the wood in pursuit of the Philistines, tasted a little of the honeycomb which was abundant there (14:27). This was afterwards discovered by Saul (ver. 42), and he threatened to put his son to death. The people, however, interposed, saying, “There shall not one hair of his head fall to the ground.” He whom God had so signally owned, who had “wrought this great salvation in Israel,” must not die. “Then Saul went up from following the Philistines: and the Philistines went to their own place” ([1 Sam. 14:24-46](/1sam#1Sam.14.24)); and thus the campaign against the Philistines came to an end. This was Saul’s second great military success.

 Saul’s reign, however, continued to be one of almost constant war against his enemies round about (14:47, 48), in all of which he proved victorious. The war against the Amalekites is the only one which is recorded at length ([1 Sam. 15](/1sam#1Sam.15)). These oldest and hereditary ([Ex. 17:8](/exod#Exod.17.8); [Num. 14:43-45](/num#Num.14.43)) enemies of Israel occupied the territory to the south and south-west of Palestine. Samuel summoned Saul to execute the “ban” which God had pronounced ([Deut. 25:17-19](/deut#Deut.25.17)) on this cruel and relentless foe of Israel. The cup of their iniquity was now full. This command was “the test of his moral qualification for being king.” Saul proceeded to execute the divine command; and gathering the people together, marched from Telaim ([1 Sam. 15:4](/1sam#1Sam.15.4)) against the Amalekites, whom he smote “from Havilah until thou comest to Shur,” utterly destroying “all the people with the edge of the sword”, i.e., all that fell into his hands. He was, however, guilty of rebellion and disobedience in sparing Agag their king, and in conniving at his soldiers’ sparing the best of the sheep and cattle; and Samuel, following Saul to Gilgal, in the Jordan valley, said unto him, “Because thou hast rejected the word of the Lord, he also hath rejected thee from being king” (15:23). The kingdom was rent from Saul and was given to another, even to David, whom the Lord chose to be Saul’s successor, and whom Samuel anointed (16:1-13). From that day “the spirit of the Lord departed from Saul, and an evil spirit from the Lord troubled him.” He and Samuel parted only to meet once again at one of the schools of the prophets.

 David was now sent for as a “cunning player on an harp” ([1 Sam. 16:16](/1sam#1Sam.16.16), [18](/1sam#1Sam.16.18)), to play before Saul when the evil spirit troubled him, and thus was introduced to the court of Saul. He became a great favourite with the king. At length David returned to his father’s house and to his wonted avocation as a shepherd for perhaps some three years. The Philistines once more invaded the land, and gathered their army between Shochoh and Azekah, in Ephes-dammim, on the southern slope of the valley of Elah. Saul and the men of Israel went forth to meet them, and encamped on the northern slope of the same valley which lay between the two armies. It was here that David slew Goliath of Gath, the champion of the Philistines (17:4-54), an exploit which led to the flight and utter defeat of the Philistine army. Saul now took David permanently into his service (18:2); but he became jealous of him (ver. 9), and on many occasions showed his enmity toward him (ver. 10, 11), his enmity ripening into a purpose of murder which at different times he tried in vain to carry out.

 After some time the Philistines “gathered themselves together” in the plain of Esdraelon, and pitched their camp at Shunem, on the slope of Little Hermon; and Saul “gathered all Israel together,” and “pitched in Gilboa” ([1 Sam. 28:3-14](/1sam#1Sam.28.3)). Being unable to discover the mind of the Lord, Saul, accompanied by two of his retinue, betook himself to the “witch of Endor,” some 7 or 8 miles distant. Here he was overwhelmed by the startling communication that was mysteriously made to him by Samuel (ver. 16-19), who appeared to him. “He fell straightway all along on the earth, and was sore afraid, because of the words of Samuel” (ver. 20). The Philistine host “fought against Israel: and the men of Israel fled before the Philistines, and fell down slain in Mount Gilboa” (31:1). In his despair at the disaster that had befallen his army, Saul “took a sword and fell upon it.” And the Philistines on the morrow “found Saul and his three sons fallen in Mount Gilboa.” Having cut off his head, they sent it with his weapons to Philistia, and hung up the skull in the temple of Dagon at Ashdod. They suspended his headless body, with that of Jonathan, from the walls of Bethshan. The men of Jabesh-gilead afterwards removed the bodies from this position; and having burnt the flesh, they buried the bodies under a tree at Jabesh. The remains were, however, afterwards removed to the family sepulchre at Zelah ([2 Sam. 21:13](/2sam#2Sam.21.13), [14](/2sam#2Sam.21.14)).",2.0,person,saul_2478,saul_2478,

The priest made atonement over the scapegoat, laying Israel’s guilt upon it, and then sent it away, the goat bearing “upon him all their iniquities unto a land not inhabited.”

 At a later period an evasion or modification of the law of Moses was introduced by the Jews. “The goat was conducted to a mountain named Tzuk, situated at a distance of ten Sabbath days’ journey, or about six and a half English miles, from Jerusalem. At this place the Judean desert was supposed to commence; and the man in whose charge the goat was sent out, while setting him free, was instructed to push the unhappy beast down the slope of the mountain side, which was so steep as to insure the death of the goat, whose bones were broken by the fall. The reason of this barbarous custom was that on one occasion the scapegoat returned to Jerusalem after being set free, which was considered such an evil omen that its recurrence was prevented for the future by the death of the goat” (Twenty-one Years’ Work in the Holy Land).

Scribes,5376,s-p134.9,Scribes,"Anciently held various important offices in the public affairs of the nation. The Hebrew word so rendered (sopher) is first used to designate the holder of some military office ([Judg. 5:14](/judg#Judg.5.14); A.V., “pen of the writer;” R.V., “the marshal’s staff;” marg., “the staff of the scribe”). The scribes acted as secretaries of state, whose business it was to prepare and issue decrees in the name of the king ([2 Sam. 8:17](/2sam#2Sam.8.17); [20:25](/2sam#2Sam.20.25); [1 Chr. 18:16](/1chr#1Chr.18.16); [24:6](/1chr#1Chr.24.6); [1 Kings 4:3](/1kgs#1Kgs.4.3); [2 Kings 12:9-11](/2kgs#2Kgs.12.9); [18:18-37](/2kgs#2Kgs.18.18), etc.). They discharged various other important public duties as men of high authority and influence in the affairs of state.

 There was also a subordinate class of scribes, most of whom were Levites. They were engaged in various ways as writers. Such, for example, was Baruch, who “wrote from the mouth of Jeremiah all the words of the Lord” ([Jer. 36:4](/jer#Jer.36.4), [32](/jer#Jer.36.32)).

 In later times, after the Captivity, when the nation lost its independence, the scribes turned their attention to the law, gaining for themselves distinction by their intimate acquaintance with its contents. On them devolved the duty of multiplying copies of the law and of teaching it to others ([Ezra 7:6](/ezra#Ezra.7.6), [10-12](/ezra#Ezra.7.10); [Neh. 8:1](/neh#Neh.8.1), [4](/neh#Neh.8.4), [9](/neh#Neh.8.9), [13](/neh#Neh.8.13)). It is evident that in New Testament times the scribes belonged to the sect of the Pharisees, who supplemented the ancient written law by their traditions ([Matt. 23](/matt#Matt.23)), thereby obscuring it and rendering it of none effect. The titles “scribes” and “lawyers” (q.v.) are in the Gospels interchangeable ([Matt. 22:35](/matt#Matt.22.35); [Mark 12:28](/mark#Mark.12.28); [Luke 20:39](/luke#Luke.20.39), etc.). They were in the time of our Lord the public teachers of the people, and frequently came into collision with him. They afterwards showed themselves greatly hostile to the apostles ([Acts 4:5](/acts#Acts.4.5); [6:12](/acts#Acts.6.12)).

 Some of the scribes, however, were men of a different spirit, and showed themselves friendly to the gospel and its preachers. Thus Gamaliel advised the Sanhedrin, when the apostles were before them charged with “teaching in this name,” to “refrain from these men and let them alone” ([Acts 5:34-39](/acts#Acts.5.34); comp. 23:9).",0.0,unmatched,unmatched,,

It was God’s purpose thus to perpetuate his revealed will. From time to time he raised up men to commit to writing in an infallible record the revelation he gave. The “Scripture,” or collection of sacred writings, was thus enlarged from time to time as God saw necessary. We have now a completed “Scripture,” consisting of the Old and New Testaments. The Old Testament canon in the time of our Lord was precisely the same as that which we now possess under that name. He placed the seal of his own authority on this collection of writings, as all equally given by inspiration ([Matt. 5:17](/matt#Matt.5.17); [7:12](/matt#Matt.7.12); [22:40](/matt#Matt.22.40); [Luke 16:29](/luke#Luke.16.29), [31](/luke#Luke.16.31)).",0.0,unmatched,unmatched,,

Seal,5381,s-p143.2,Seal,"Commonly a ring engraved with some device ([Gen. 38:18](/gen#Gen.38.18), [25](/gen#Gen.38.25)). Jezebel “wrote letters in Ahab’s name, and sealed them with his seal” ([1 Kings 21:8](/1kgs#1Kgs.21.8)). Seals are frequently mentioned in Jewish history ([Deut. 32:34](/deut#Deut.32.34); [Neh. 9:38](/neh#Neh.9.38); [10:1](/neh#Neh.10.1); [Esther 3:12](/esth#Esth.3.12); [Cant. 8:6](/song#Song.8.6); [Isa. 8:16](/isa#Isa.8.16); [Jer. 22:24](/jer#Jer.22.24); [32:44](/jer#Jer.32.44), etc.). Sealing a document was equivalent to the signature of the owner of the seal. “The use of a signet-ring by the monarch has recently received a remarkable illustration by the discovery of an impression of such a signet on fine clay at Koyunjik, the site of the ancient Nineveh. This seal appears to have been impressed from the bezel of a metallic finger-ring. It is an oval, 2 inches in length by 1 inch wide, and bears the image, name, and titles of the Egyptian king Sabaco” (Rawlinson’s Hist. Illus. of the O.T., p. 46). The actual signet-rings of two Egyptian kings (Cheops and Horus) have been discovered.

 The use of seals is mentioned in the New Testament only in connection with the record of our Lord’s burial ([Matt. 27:66](/matt#Matt.27.66)). The tomb was sealed by the Pharisees and chief priests for the purpose of making sure that the disciples would not come and steal the body away (ver. 63, 64). The mode of doing this was probably by stretching a cord across the stone and sealing it at both ends with sealing-clay. When God is said to have sealed the Redeemer, the meaning is, that he has attested his divine mission ([John 6:27](/john#John.6.27)). Circumcision is a seal, an attestation of the covenant ([Rom. 4:11](/rom#Rom.4.11)). Believers are sealed with the Spirit, as God’s mark put upon them ([Eph. 1:13](/eph#Eph.1.13); [4:30](/eph#Eph.4.30)). Converts are by Paul styled the seal of his apostleship, i.e., they are its attestation ([1 Cor. 9:2](/1cor#1Cor.9.2)).

From these places I took and carried off 200,156 persons, old and young, male and female, together with horses and mules, asses and camels, oxen and sheep, a countless multitude; and Hezekiah himself I shut up in Jerusalem, his capital city, like a bird in a cage, building towers round the city to hem him in, and raising banks of earth against the gates, so as to prevent escape...Then upon Hezekiah there fell the fear of the power of my arms, and he sent out to me the chiefs and the elders of Jerusalem with 30 talents of gold and 800 talents of silver, and divers treasures, a rich and immense booty...All these things were brought to me at Nineveh, the seat of my government.” (Comp. [Isa. 22:1-13](/isa#Isa.22.1) for description of the feelings of the inhabitants of Jerusalem at such a crisis.)

 Hezekiah was not disposed to become an Assyrian feudatory. He accordingly at once sought help from Egypt ([2 Kings 18:20-24](/2kgs#2Kgs.18.20)). Sennacherib, hearing of this, marched a second time into Palestine ([2 Kings 18:17](/2kgs#2Kgs.18.17), [37](/2kgs#2Kgs.18.37); 19; [2 Chr. 32:9-23](/2chr#2Chr.32.9); [Isa. 36:2-22](/isa#Isa.36.2). [Isa. 37:25](/isa#Isa.37.25) should be rendered “dried up all the Nile-arms of Matsor,” i.e., of Egypt, so called from the “Matsor” or great fortification across the isthmus of Suez, which protected it from invasions from the east). Sennacherib sent envoys to try to persuade Hezekiah to surrender, but in vain. He next sent a threatening letter ([2 Kings 19:10-14](/2kgs#2Kgs.19.10)), which Hezekiah carried into the temple and spread before the Lord. Isaiah again brought an encouraging message to the pious king ([2 Kings 19:20-34](/2kgs#2Kgs.19.20)). “In that night” the angel of the Lord went forth and smote the camp of the Assyrians. In the morning, “behold, they were all dead corpses.” The Assyrian army was annihilated.

 This great disaster is not, as was to be expected, taken notice of in the Assyrian annals.

 Though Sennacherib survived this disaster some twenty years, he never again renewed his attempt against Jerusalem. He was murdered by two of his own sons (Adrammelech and Sharezer), and was succeeded by another son, Esarhaddon (B.C. 681), after a reign of twenty-four years.",0.0,person,sennacherib_2489,sennacherib_2489,

Others identify it with Sardis, the capital of Lydia. The Latin father Jerome regarded it as an Assyrian word, meaning “boundary,” and interpreted the sentence, “which is in Sepharad,” by “who are scattered abroad in all the boundaries and regions of the earth.” Perowne says: “Whatever uncertainty attaches to the word Sepharad, the drift of the prophecy is clear, viz., that not only the exiles from Babylon, but Jewish captives from other and distant regions, shall be brought back to live prosperously within the enlarged borders of their own land.”",0.0,unmatched,unmatched,,sepharad_1049

 This word is used symbolically of a deadly, subtle, malicious enemy ([Luke 10:19](/luke#Luke.10.19)).

 The serpent is first mentioned in connection with the history of the temptation and fall of our first parents ([Gen. 3](/gen#Gen.3)). It has been well remarked regarding this temptation: “A real serpent was the agent of the temptation, as is plain from what is said of the natural characteristic of the serpent in the first verse of the chapter (3:1), and from the curse pronounced upon the animal itself. But that Satan was the actual tempter, and that he used the serpent merely as his instrument, is evident (1) from the nature of the transaction; for although the serpent may be the most subtle of all the beasts of the field, yet he has not the high intellectual faculties which the tempter here displayed.",0.0,unmatched,unmatched,,

Shechem 3,5531,s-p283.2,Shechem,"A city in Samaria ([Gen. 33:18](/gen#Gen.33.18)), called also Sichem (12:6), Sychem ([Acts 7:16](/acts#Acts.7.16)). It stood in the narrow sheltered valley between Ebal on the north and Gerizim on the south, these mountains at their base being only some 500 yards apart. Here Abraham pitched his tent and built his first altar in the Promised Land, and received the first divine promise ([Gen. 12:6](/gen#Gen.12.6), [7](/gen#Gen.12.7)). Here also Jacob “bought a parcel of a field at the hands of the children of Hamor” after his return from Mesopotamia, and settled with his household, which he purged from idolatry by burying the teraphim of his followers under an oak tree, which was afterwards called “the oak of the sorcerer” ([Gen. 33:19](/gen#Gen.33.19); [35:4](/gen#Gen.35.4); [Judg. 9:37](/judg#Judg.9.37)). Here too, after a while, he dug a well, which bears his name to this day ([John 4:5](/john#John.4.5), [39-42](/john#John.4.39)). To Shechem Joshua gathered all Israel “before God,” and delivered to them his second parting address ([Josh. 24:1-15](/josh#Josh.24.1)). He “made a covenant with the people that day” at the very place where, on first entering the land, they had responded to the law from Ebal and Gerizim ([Josh. 24:25](/josh#Josh.24.25)), the terms of which were recorded “in the book of the law of God”, i.e., in the roll of the law of Moses; and in memory of this solemn transaction a great stone was set up “under an oak” (comp. [Gen. 28:18](/gen#Gen.28.18); [31:44-48](/gen#Gen.31.44); [Ex. 24:4](/exod#Exod.24.4); [Josh. 4:3](/josh#Josh.4.3), [8](/josh#Josh.4.8), [9](/josh#Josh.4.9)), possibly the old “oak of Moreh,” as a silent witness of the transaction to all coming time.

 Shechem became one of the cities of refuge, the central city of refuge for Western Palestine ([Josh. 20:7](/josh#Josh.20.7)), and here the bones of Joseph were buried (24:32). Rehoboam was appointed king in Shechem ([1 Kings 12:1](/1kgs#1Kgs.12.1), [19](/1kgs#1Kgs.12.19)), but Jeroboam afterwards took up his residence here. This city is mentioned in connection with our Lord’s conversation with the woman of Samaria ([John 4:5](/john#John.4.5)); and thus, remaining as it does to the present day, it is one of the oldest cities of the world. It is the modern Nablus, a contraction for Neapolis, the name given to it by Vespasian. It lies about a mile and a half up the valley on its southern slope, and on the north of Gerizim, which rises about 1,100 feet above it, and is about 34 miles north of Jerusalem. It contains about 10,000 inhabitants, of whom about 160 are Samaritans and 100 Jews, the rest being Christians and Mohammedans.

 The site of Shechem is said to be of unrivalled beauty. Stanley says it is “the most beautiful, perhaps the only very beautiful, spot in Central Palestine.”

 Gaza, near Shechem, only mentioned [1 Chr. 7:28](/1chr#1Chr.7.28), has entirely disappeared. It was destroyed at the time of the Conquest, and its place was taken by Shechem.",3.0,multi,"['shechem_1069', 'shechem_2588']",,shechem_1069
Shechinah,5532,s-p289.3,Shechinah,"A Chaldee word meaning resting-place, not found in Scripture, but used by the later Jews to designate the visible symbol of God’s presence in the tabernacle, and afterwards in Solomon’s temple. When the Lord led Israel out of Egypt, he went before them “in a pillar of a cloud.” This was the symbol of his presence with his people. For references made to it during the wilderness wanderings, see [Ex. 14:20](/exod#Exod.14.20); [40:34-38](/exod#Exod.40.34); [Lev. 9:23](/lev#Lev.9.23), [24](/lev#Lev.9.24); [Num. 14:10](/num#Num.14.10); [16:19](/num#Num.16.19), [42](/num#Num.16.42).

 It is probable that after the entrance into Canaan this glory-cloud settled in the tabernacle upon the ark of the covenant in the most holy place. We have, however, no special reference to it till the consecration of the temple by Solomon, when it filled the whole house with its glory, so that the priests could not stand to minister ([1 Kings 8:10-13](/1kgs#1Kgs.8.10); [2 Chr. 5:13](/2chr#2Chr.5.13), [14](/2chr#2Chr.5.14); [7:1-3](/2chr#2Chr.7.1)).

Sheep,5533,s-p291.6,Sheep,"Are of different varieties. Probably the flocks of Abraham and Isaac were of the wild species found still in the mountain regions of Persia and Kurdistan. After the Exodus, and as a result of intercourse with surrounding nations, other species were no doubt introduced into the herds of the people of Israel. They are frequently mentioned in Scripture. The care of a shepherd over his flock is referred to as illustrating God’s care over his people ([Ps. 23:1](/ps#Ps.23.1), [2](/ps#Ps.23.2); [74:1](/ps#Ps.74.1); [77:20](/ps#Ps.77.20); [Isa. 40:11](/isa#Isa.40.11); [53:6](/isa#Isa.53.6); [John 10:1-5](/john#John.10.1), [7-16](/john#John.10.7)).

 “The sheep of Palestine are longer in the head than ours, and have tails from 5 inches broad at the narrowest part to 15 inches at the widest, the weight being in proportion, and ranging generally from 10 to 14 lbs., but sometimes extending to 30 lbs. The tails are indeed huge masses of fat” (Geikie’s Holy Land, etc.). The tail was no doubt the “rump” so frequently referred to in the Levitical sacrifices ([Ex. 29:22](/exod#Exod.29.22); [Lev. 3:9](/lev#Lev.3.9); [7:3](/lev#Lev.7.3); [9:19](/lev#Lev.9.19)). Sheep-shearing was generally an occasion of great festivity ([Gen. 31:19](/gen#Gen.31.19); [38:12](/gen#Gen.38.12), [13](/gen#Gen.38.13); [1 Sam. 25:4-8](/1sam#1Sam.25.4), [36](/1sam#1Sam.25.36); [2 Sam. 13:23-28](/2sam#2Sam.13.23)).",0.0,unmatched,unmatched,,

There were shekels of gold ([1 Chr. 21:25](/1chr#1Chr.21.25)), of silver ([1 Sam. 9:8](/1sam#1Sam.9.8)), of brass (17:5), and of iron (7). When it became a coined piece of money, the shekel of gold was equivalent to about 2 pound of our money. Six gold shekels, according to the later Jewish system, were equal in value to fifty silver ones.

 The temple contribution, with which the public sacrifices were bought ([Ex. 30:13](/exod#Exod.30.13); [2 Chr. 24:6](/2chr#2Chr.24.6)), consisted of one common shekel, or a sanctuary half-shekel, equal to two Attic drachmas. The coin, a stater (q.v.), which Peter found in the fish’s mouth paid this contribution for both him and Christ ([Matt. 17:24](/matt#Matt.17.24), [27](/matt#Matt.17.27)).

 The duties of a shepherd in an unenclosed country like Palestine were very onerous. “In early morning he led forth the flock from the fold, marching at its head to the spot where they were to be pastured. Here he watched them all day, taking care that none of the sheep strayed, and if any for a time eluded his watch and wandered away from the rest, seeking diligently till he found and brought it back. In those lands sheep require to be supplied regularly with water, and the shepherd for this purpose has to guide them either to some running stream or to wells dug in the wilderness and furnished with troughs. At night he brought the flock home to the fold, counting them as they passed under the rod at the door to assure himself that none were missing. Nor did his labours always end with sunset. Often he had to guard the fold through the dark hours from the attack of wild beasts, or the wily attempts of the prowling thief (see [1 Sam. 17:34](/1sam#1Sam.17.34)).”, Deane’s David.",0.0,unmatched,unmatched,,

 This bread consisted of twelve loaves made of the finest flour. They were flat and thin, and were placed in two rows of six each on a table in the holy place before the Lord. They were renewed every Sabbath ([Lev. 24:5-9](/lev#Lev.24.5)), and those that were removed to give place to the new ones were to be eaten by the priests only in the holy place (see [1 Sam. 21:3-6](/1sam#1Sam.21.3); comp.

 The number of the loaves represented the twelve tribes of Israel, and also the entire spiritual Israel, “the true Israel;” and the placing of them on the table symbolized the entire consecration of Israel to the Lord, and their acceptance of God as their God.

Thus when the Ephraimites from the west invaded Gilead, and were defeated by the Gileadites under the leadership of Jephthah, and tried to escape by the “passages of the Jordan,” the Gileadites seized the fords and would allow none to pass who could not pronounce “shibboleth” with a strong aspirate.

 The water which flows into this pool intermittingly by a subterranean channel springs from the “Fountain of the Virgin” (q.v.). The length of this channel, which has several windings, is 1,750 feet, though the direct distance is only 1,100 feet. The pool is 53 feet in length from north to south, 18 feet wide, and 19 deep. The water passes from it by a channel cut in the rock into the gardens below.

 Many years ago (1880) a youth, while wading up the conduit by which the water enters the pool, accidentally discovered an inscription cut in the rock, on the eastern side, about 19 feet from the pool. This is the oldest extant Hebrew record of the kind. It has with great care been deciphered by scholars, and has been found to be an account of the manner in which the tunnel was constructed. Its whole length is said to be “twelve hundred cubits;” and the inscription further notes that the workmen, like the excavators of the Mont Cenis Tunnel, excavated from both ends, meeting in the middle.

 Some have argued that the inscription was cut in the time of Solomon; others, with more probability, refer it to the reign of Hezekiah. A more ancient tunnel was discovered in 1889 some 20 feet below the ground. It is of smaller dimensions, but more direct in its course. It is to this tunnel that Isaiah (8:6) probably refers.

 As illustrative of the movement of small bands of Canaanites from place to place, and the intermingling of Canaanites and Israelites even in small towns in earlier times, M.C. Ganneau records the following curious fact: “Among the inhabitants of the village (of Siloam) there are a hundred or so domiciled for the most part in the lower quarter, and forming a group apart from the rest, called Dhiabrye, i.e., men of Dhiban. It appears that at some remote period a colony from the capital of king Mesha (Dibon-Moab) crossed the Jordan and fixed itself at the gates of Jerusalem at Silwan.

Sin,5734,s-p492.2,Sin,"Is “any want of conformity unto or transgression of the law of God” ([1 John 3:4](/1john#1John.3.4); [Rom. 4:15](/rom#Rom.4.15)), in the inward state and habit of the soul, as well as in the outward conduct of the life, whether by omission or commission ([Rom. 6:12-17](/rom#Rom.6.12); [7:5-24](/rom#Rom.7.5)). It is “not a mere violation of the law of our constitution, nor of the system of things, but an offence against a personal lawgiver and moral governor who vindicates his law with penalties. The soul that sins is always conscious that his sin is (1) intrinsically vile and polluting, and (2) that it justly deserves punishment, and calls down the righteous wrath of God. Hence sin carries with it two inalienable characters, (1) ill-desert, guilt (reatus); and (2) pollution (macula).”, Hodge’s Outlines.

 The moral character of a man’s actions is determined by the moral state of his heart. The disposition to sin, or the habit of the soul that leads to the sinful act, is itself also sin ([Rom. 6:12-17](/rom#Rom.6.12); [Gal. 5:17](/gal#Gal.5.17); [James 1:14](/jas#Jas.1.14), [15](/jas#Jas.1.15)).

 The origin of sin is a mystery, and must for ever remain such to us. It is plain that for some reason God has permitted sin to enter this world, and that is all we know. His permitting it, however, in no way makes God the author of sin.

 Adam’s sin ([Gen. 3:1-6](/gen#Gen.3.1)) consisted in his yielding to the assaults of temptation and eating the forbidden fruit. It involved in it, (1) the sin of unbelief, virtually making God a liar; and (2) the guilt of disobedience to a positive command. By this sin he became an apostate from God, a rebel in arms against his Creator. He lost the favour of God and communion with him; his whole nature became depraved, and he incurred the penalty involved in the covenant of works.

 Original sin. “Our first parents being the root of all mankind, the guilt of their sin was imputed, and the same death in sin and corrupted nature were conveyed to all their posterity, descending from them by ordinary generation.” Adam was constituted by God the federal head and representative of all his posterity, as he was also their natural head, and therefore when he fell they fell with him ([Rom. 5:12-21](/rom#Rom.5.12); [1 Cor. 15:22-45](/1cor#1Cor.15.22)). His probation was their probation, and his fall their fall. Because of Adam’s first sin all his posterity came into the world in a state of sin and condemnation, i.e., (1) a state of moral corruption, and (2) of guilt, as having judicially imputed to them the guilt of Adam’s first sin.

 “Original sin” is frequently and properly used to denote only the moral corruption of their whole nature inherited by all men from Adam. This inherited moral corruption consists in, (1) the loss of original righteousness; and (2) the presence of a constant proneness to evil, which is the root and origin of all actual sin. It is called “sin” ([Rom. 6:12](/rom#Rom.6.12), [14](/rom#Rom.6.14), [17](/rom#Rom.6.17); 7:5-17), the “flesh” ([Gal. 5:17](/gal#Gal.5.17), [24](/gal#Gal.5.24)), “lust” ([James 1:14](/jas#Jas.1.14), [15](/jas#Jas.1.15)), the “body of sin” ([Rom. 6:6](/rom#Rom.6.6)), “ignorance,” “blindness of heart,” “alienation from the life of God” ([Eph. 4:18](/eph#Eph.4.18), [19](/eph#Eph.4.19)). It influences and depraves the whole man, and its tendency is still downward to deeper and deeper corruption, there remaining no recuperative element in the soul. It is a total depravity, and it is also universally inherited by all the natural descendants of Adam ([Rom. 3:10-23](/rom#Rom.3.10); [5:12-21](/rom#Rom.5.12); [8:7](/rom#Rom.8.7)). Pelagians deny original sin, and regard man as by nature morally and spiritually well; semi-Pelagians regard him as morally sick; Augustinians, or, as they are also called, Calvinists, regard man as described above, spiritually dead ([Eph. 2:1](/eph#Eph.2.1); [1 John 3:14](/1john#1John.3.14)).

Sinai,5743,s-p501.2,Sinai,"Of Sin (the moon god), called also Horeb, the name of the mountain district which was reached by the Hebrews in the third month after the Exodus. Here they remained encamped for about a whole year. Their journey from the Red Sea to this encampment, including all the windings of the route, was about 150 miles. The last twenty-two chapters of Exodus, together with the whole of Leviticus and Num. ch. 1-11, contain a record of all the transactions which occurred while they were here. From Rephidim ([Ex. 17:8-13](/exod#Exod.17.8)) the Israelites journeyed forward through the Wady Solaf and Wady esh-Sheikh into the plain of er-Rahah, “the desert of Sinai,” about 2 miles long and half a mile broad, and encamped there “before the mountain.” The part of the mountain range, a protruding lower bluff, known as the Ras Sasafeh (Sufsafeh), rises almost perpendicularly from this plain, and is in all probability the Sinai of history. Dean Stanley thus describes the scene:, “The plain itself is not broken and uneven and narrowly shut in, like almost all others in the range, but presents a long retiring sweep, within which the people could remove and stand afar off. The cliff, rising like a huge altar in front of the whole congregation, and visible against the sky in lonely grandeur from end to end of the whole plain, is the very image of the ‘mount that might be touched,’ and from which the voice of God might be heard far and wide over the plain below.” This was the scene of the giving of the law. From the Ras Sufsafeh the law was proclaimed to the people encamped below in the plain of er-Rahah. During the lengthened period of their encampment here the Israelites passed through a very memorable experience. An immense change passed over them. They are now an organized nation, bound by covenant engagement to serve the Lord their God, their ever-present divine Leader and Protector. At length, in the second month of the second year of the Exodus, they move their camp and march forward according to a prescribed order. After three days they reach the “wilderness of Paran,” the “et-Tih”, i.e., “the desert”, and here they make their first encampment. At this time a spirit of discontent broke out amongst them, and the Lord manifested his displeasure by a fire which fell on the encampment and inflicted injury on them. Moses called the place Taberah (q.v.), [Num. 11:1-3](/num#Num.11.1). The journey between Sinai and the southern boundary of the Promised Land (about 150 miles) at Kadesh was accomplished in about a year.",0.0,unmatched,unmatched,,"mount_sinai_855,sinai_1098"
Sinaiticus codex,5744,s-p502.3,Sinaiticus codex,"Usually designated by the first letter of the Hebrew alphabet, is one of the most valuable of ancient MSS. of the Greek New Testament. On the occasion of a third visit to the convent of St. Catherine, on Mount Sinai, in 1859, it was discovered by Dr. Tischendorf. He had on a previous visit in 1844 obtained forty-three parchment leaves of the LXX., which he deposited in the university library of Leipsic, under the title of the Codex Frederico-Augustanus, after his royal patron the king of Saxony. In the year referred to (1859) the emperor of Russia sent him to prosecute his search for MSS., which he was convinced were still to be found in the Sinai convent. The story of his finding the manuscript of the New Testament has all the interest of a romance. He reached the convent on 31st January; but his inquiries appeared to be fruitless. On the 4th February he had resolved to return home without having gained his object. “On that day, when walking with the provisor of the convent, he spoke with much regret of his ill-success. Returning from their promenade, Tischendorf accompanied the monk to his room, and there had displayed to him what his companion called a copy of the LXX., which he, the ghostly brother, owned. The MS. was wrapped up in a piece of cloth, and on its being unrolled, to the surprise and delight of the critic the very document presented itself which he had given up all hope of seeing. His object had been to complete the fragmentary LXX. of 1844, which he had declared to be the most ancient of all Greek codices on vellum that are extant; but he found not only that, but a copy of the Greek New Testament attached, of the same age, and perfectly complete, not wanting a single page or paragraph.” This precious fragment, after some negotiations, he obtained possession of, and conveyed it to the Emperor Alexander, who fully appreciated its importance, and caused it to be published as nearly as possible in facsimile, so as to exhibit correctly the ancient handwriting. The entire codex consists of 346 1/2 folios. Of these 199 belong to the Old Testament and 147 1/2 to the New, along with two ancient documents called the Epistle of Barnabas and the Shepherd of Hermas. The books of the New Testament stand thus: the four Gospels, the epistles of Paul, the Acts of the Apostles, the Catholic Epistles, the Apocalypse of John. It is shown by Tischendorf that this codex was written in the fourth century, and is thus of about the same age as the Vatican codex; but while the latter wants the greater part of Matthew and sundry leaves here and there besides, the Sinaiticus is the only copy of the New Testament in uncial characters which is complete. Thus it is the oldest extant MS. copy of the New Testament. Both the Vatican and the Sinai codices were probably written in Egypt.",0.0,unmatched,unmatched,,

The blood was then carried into the holy of holies and sprinkled on the mercy-seat. Sin-offerings were also presented at the five annual festivals ([Num. 28](/num#Num.28), [29](/num#Num.29)), and on the occasion of the consecration of the priests ([Ex. 29:10-14](/exod#Exod.29.10), [36](/exod#Exod.29.36)). As each individual, even the most private member of the congregation, as well as the congregation at large, and the high priest, was obliged, on being convicted by his conscience of any particular sin, to come with a sin-offering, we see thus impressively disclosed the need in which every sinner stands of the salvation of Christ, and the necessity of making application to it as often as the guilt of sin renews itself upon his conscience. This resort of faith to the perfect sacrifice of Christ is the one way that lies open for the sinner’s attainment of pardon and restoration to peace. And then in the sacrifice itself there is the reality of that incomparable worth and preciousness which were so significantly represented in the sin-offering by the sacredness of its blood and the hallowed destination of its flesh.

This city and its awful destruction are frequently alluded to in Scripture ([Deut. 29:23](/deut#Deut.29.23); [32:32](/deut#Deut.32.32); [Isa. 1:9](/isa#Isa.1.9), [10](/isa#Isa.1.10); 3:9; 13:19; [Jer. 23:14](/jer#Jer.23.14); [Ezek. 16:46-56](/ezek#Ezek.16.46); [Zeph. 2:9](/zeph#Zeph.2.9); [Matt. 10:15](/matt#Matt.10.15); [Rom. 9:29](/rom#Rom.9.29); 2 Pet. 2:6, etc.).

He was probably born about B.C. 1035 ([1 Chr. 22:5](/1chr#1Chr.22.5); [29:1](/1chr#1Chr.29.1)). He succeeded his father on the throne in early manhood, probably about sixteen or eighteen years of age. Nathan, to whom his education was intrusted, called him Jedidiah, i.e., “beloved of the Lord” ([2 Sam. 12:24](/2sam#2Sam.12.24), [25](/2sam#2Sam.12.25)). He was the first king of Israel “born in the purple.” His father chose him as his successor, passing over the claims of his elder sons: “Assuredly Solomon my son shall reign after me.” His history is recorded in [1 Kings 1](/1kgs#1Kgs.1)-11 and [2 Chr. 1](/2chr#2Chr.1)-9. His elevation to the throne took place before his father’s death, and was hastened on mainly by Nathan and Bathsheba, in consequence of the rebellion of Adonijah ([1 Kings 1:5-40](/1kgs#1Kgs.1.5)). During his long reign of forty years the Hebrew monarchy gained its highest splendour. This period has well been called the “Augustan age” of the Jewish annals. The first half of his reign was, however, by far the brighter and more prosperous; the latter half was clouded by the idolatries into which he fell, mainly from his heathen intermarriages ([1 Kings 11:1-8](/1kgs#1Kgs.11.1); [14:21](/1kgs#1Kgs.14.21), [31](/1kgs#1Kgs.14.31)).

 Before his death David gave parting instructions to his son ([1 Kings 2:1-9](/1kgs#1Kgs.2.1); [1 Chr. 22:7-16](/1chr#1Chr.22.7); [28](/1chr#1Chr.28)). As soon as he had settled himself in his kingdom, and arranged the affairs of his extensive empire, he entered into an alliance with Egypt by the marriage of the daughter of Pharaoh ([1 Kings 3:1](/1kgs#1Kgs.3.1)), of whom, however, nothing further is recorded. He surrounded himself with all the luxuries and the external grandeur of an Eastern monarch, and his government prospered. He entered into an alliance with Hiram, king of Tyre, who in many ways greatly assisted him in his numerous undertakings.

 For some years before his death David was engaged in the active work of collecting materials ([1 Chr. 29:6-9](/1chr#1Chr.29.6); [2 Chr. 2:3-7](/2chr#2Chr.2.3)) for building a temple in Jerusalem as a permanent abode for the ark of the covenant. He was not permitted to build the house of God ([1 Chr. 22:8](/1chr#1Chr.22.8)); that honour was reserved to his son Solomon.

 After the completion of the temple, Solomon engaged in the erection of many other buildings of importance in Jerusalem and in other parts of his kingdom. For the long space of thirteen years he was engaged in the erection of a royal palace on Ophel ([1 Kings 7:1-12](/1kgs#1Kgs.7.1)). It was 100 cubits long, 50 broad, and 30 high. Its lofty roof was supported by forty-five cedar pillars, so that the hall was like a forest of cedar wood, and hence probably it received the name of “The House of the Forest of Lebanon.” In front of this “house” was another building, which was called the Porch of Pillars, and in front of this again was the “Hall of Judgment,” or Throne-room ([1 Kings 7:7](/1kgs#1Kgs.7.7); [10:18-20](/1kgs#1Kgs.10.18); [2 Chr. 9:17-19](/2chr#2Chr.9.17)), “the King’s Gate,” where he administered justice and gave audience to his people. This palace was a building of great magnificence and beauty. A portion of it was set apart as the residence of the queen consort, the daughter of Pharaoh. From the palace there was a private staircase of red and scented sandal wood which led up to the temple.

 Solomon also constructed great works for the purpose of securing a plentiful supply of water for the city ([Eccl. 2:4-6](/eccl#Eccl.2.4)). He then built Millo (LXX., “Acra”) for the defence of the city, completing a line of ramparts around it ([1 Kings 9:15](/1kgs#1Kgs.9.15), [24](/1kgs#1Kgs.9.24); 11:27). He erected also many other fortifications for the defence of his kingdom at various points where it was exposed to the assault of enemies ([1 Kings 9:15-19](/1kgs#1Kgs.9.15); [2 Chr. 8:2-6](/2chr#2Chr.8.2)). Among his great undertakings must also be mentioned the building of Tadmor (q.v.) in the wilderness as a commercial depot, as well as a military outpost.

 During his reign Palestine enjoyed great commercial prosperity. Extensive traffic was carried on by land with Tyre and Egypt and Arabia, and by sea with Spain and India and the coasts of Africa, by which Solomon accumulated vast stores of wealth and of the produce of all nations ([1 Kings 9:26-28](/1kgs#1Kgs.9.26); [10:11](/1kgs#1Kgs.10.11), [12](/1kgs#1Kgs.10.12); [2 Chr. 8:17](/2chr#2Chr.8.17), [18](/2chr#2Chr.8.18); 9:21). This was the “golden age” of Israel. The royal magnificence and splendour of Solomon’s court were unrivalled. He had seven hundred wives and three hundred concubines, an evidence at once of his pride, his wealth, and his sensuality. The maintenance of his household involved immense expenditure. The provision required for one day was “thirty measures of fine flour, and threescore measures of meal, ten fat oxen, and twenty oxen out of the pastures, and an hundred sheep, beside harts, and roebucks, and fallow-deer, and fatted fowl” ([1 Kings 4:22](/1kgs#1Kgs.4.22), [23](/1kgs#1Kgs.4.23)).

 Solomon’s reign was not only a period of great material prosperity, but was equally remarkable for its intellectual activity. He was the leader of his people also in this uprising amongst them of new intellectual life. “He spake three thousand proverbs: and his songs were a thousand and five. And he spake of trees, from the cedar tree that is in Lebanon even unto the hyssop that springeth out of the wall: he spake also of beasts, and of fowl, and of creeping things, and of fishes” ([1 Kings 4:32](/1kgs#1Kgs.4.32), [33](/1kgs#1Kgs.4.33)).

 His fame was spread abroad through all lands, and men came from far and near “to hear the wisdom of Solomon.” Among others thus attracted to Jerusalem was “the queen of the south” ([Matt. 12:42](/matt#Matt.12.42)), the queen of Sheba, a country in Arabia Felix. “Deep, indeed, must have been her yearning, and great his fame, which induced a secluded Arabian queen to break through the immemorial custom of her dreamy land, and to put forth the energy required for braving the burdens and perils of so long a journey across a wilderness. Yet this she undertook, and carried it out with safety.” ([1 Kings 10:1-13](/1kgs#1Kgs.10.1); [2 Chr. 9:1-12](/2chr#2Chr.9.1).) She was filled with amazement by all she saw and heard: “there was no more spirit in her.” After an interchange of presents she returned to her native land.

 But that golden age of Jewish history passed away. The bright day of Solomon’s glory ended in clouds and darkness. His decline and fall from his high estate is a sad record. Chief among the causes of his decline were his polygamy and his great wealth. “As he grew older he spent more of his time among his favourites. The idle king living among these idle women, for 1,000 women, with all their idle and mischievous attendants, filled the palaces and pleasure-houses which he had built ([1 Kings 11:3](/1kgs#1Kgs.11.3)), learned first to tolerate and then to imitate their heathenish ways. He did not, indeed, cease to believe in the God of Israel with his mind. He did not cease to offer the usual sacrifices in the temple at the great feasts. But his heart was not right with God; his worship became merely formal; his soul, left empty by the dying out of true religious fervour, sought to be filled with any religious excitement which offered itself. Now for the first time a worship was publicly set up amongst the people of the Lord which was not simply irregular or forbidden, like that of Gideon ([Judg. 8:27](/judg#Judg.8.27)), or the Danites ([Judg. 18:30](/judg#Judg.18.30), [31](/judg#Judg.18.31)), but was downright idolatrous.” ([1 Kings 11:7](/1kgs#1Kgs.11.7); [2 Kings 23:13](/2kgs#2Kgs.23.13).)

 This brought upon him the divine displeasure. His enemies prevailed against him ([1 Kings 11:14-22](/1kgs#1Kgs.11.14), [23-25](/1kgs#1Kgs.11.23), [26-40](/1kgs#1Kgs.11.26)), and one judgment after another fell upon the land. And now the end of all came, and he died, after a reign of forty years, and was buried in the city of David, and “with him was buried the short-lived glory and unity of Israel.” “He leaves behind him but one weak and worthless son, to dismember his kingdom and disgrace his name.”

 “The kingdom of Solomon,” says Rawlinson, “is one of the most striking facts in the Biblical history. A petty nation, which for hundreds of years has with difficulty maintained a separate existence in the midst of warlike tribes, each of which has in turn exercised dominion over it and oppressed it, is suddenly raised by the genius of a soldier-monarch to glory and greatness. An empire is established which extends from the Euphrates to the borders of Egypt, a distance of 450 miles; and this empire, rapidly constructed, enters almost immediately on a period of peace which lasts for half a century. Wealth, grandeur, architectural magnificence, artistic excellence, commercial enterprise, a position of dignity among the great nations of the earth, are enjoyed during this space, at the end of which there is a sudden collapse. The ruling nation is split in twain, the subject-races fall off, the pre-eminence lately gained being wholly lost, the scene of struggle, strife, oppression, recovery, inglorious submission, and desperate effort, re-commences.”, Historical Illustrations.",0.0,person,solomon_2762,solomon_2762,

Son of God,5784,s-p551.15,Son of God,"The plural, “sons of God,” is used ([Gen. 6:2](/gen#Gen.6.2), [4](/gen#Gen.6.4)) to denote the pious descendants of Seth. In [Job 1:6](/job#Job.1.6); [38:7](/job#Job.38.7) this name is applied to the angels. Hosea uses the phrase (1:10) to designate the gracious relation in which men stand to God.

 In the New Testament this phrase frequently denotes the relation into which we are brought to God by adoption ([Rom. 8:14](/rom#Rom.8.14), [19](/rom#Rom.8.19); [2 Cor. 6:18](/2cor#2Cor.6.18); [Gal. 4:5](/gal#Gal.4.5), [6](/gal#Gal.4.6); [Phil. 2:15](/phil#Phil.2.15); [1 John 3:1](/1john#1John.3.1), [2](/1john#1John.3.2)). It occurs thirty-seven times in the New Testament as the distinctive title of our Saviour. He does not bear this title in consequence of his miraculous birth, nor of his incarnation, his resurrection, and exaltation to the Father’s right hand. This is a title of nature and not of office. The sonship of Christ denotes his equality with the Father. To call Christ the Son of God is to assert his true and proper divinity. The second Person of the Trinity, because of his eternal relation to the first Person, is the Son of God. He is the Son of God as to his divine nature, while as to his human nature he is the Son of David ([Rom. 1:3](/rom#Rom.1.3), [4](/rom#Rom.1.4). Comp.

 When used with reference to creatures, whether men or angels, this word is always in the plural. In the singular it is always used of the second Person of the Trinity, with the single exception of [Luke 3:38](/luke#Luke.3.38), where it is used of Adam.",0.0,unmatched,unmatched,,

They at once proceeded on their important errand, and went through the land as far north as the district round Lake Merom. After about six weeks’ absence they returned. Their report was very discouraging, and the people were greatly alarmed, and in a rebellious spirit proposed to elect a new leader and return to Egypt. Only two of the spies, Caleb and Joshua, showed themselves on this occasion stout-hearted and faithful. All their appeals and remonstrances were in vain. Moses announced that as a punishment for their rebellion they must now wander in the wilderness till a new generation should arise which would go up and posses the land. The spies had been forty days absent on their expedition, and for each day the Israelites were to be wanderers for a year in the desert.

 Two spies were sent by Joshua “secretly” i.e., unknown to the people ([Josh. 2:1](/josh#Josh.2.1)), “to view the land and Jericho” after the death of Moses, and just before the tribes under his leadership were about to cross the Jordan.

Two species are found in Palestine, the white, which are dispersed in pairs over the whole country; and the black, which live in marshy places and in great flocks. They migrate to Palestine periodically (about the 22nd of March). Jeremiah alludes to this ([Jer. 8:7](/jer#Jer.8.7)).

Synagogue,5859,s-p636.3,Synagogue,"(Gr. sunagoge, i.e., “an assembly”), found only once in the Authorized Version of [Ps. 74:8](/ps#Ps.74.8), where the margin of Revised Version has “places of assembly,” which is probably correct; for while the origin of synagogues is unknown, it may well be supposed that buildings or tents for the accommodation of worshippers may have existed in the land from an early time, and thus the system of synagogues would be gradually developed.

 Some, however, are of opinion that it was specially during the Babylonian captivity that the system of synagogue worship, if not actually introduced, was at least reorganized on a systematic plan ([Ezek. 8:1](/ezek#Ezek.8.1); [14:1](/ezek#Ezek.14.1)). The exiles gathered together for the reading of the law and the prophets as they had opportunity, and after their return synagogues were established all over the land ([Ezra 8:15](/ezra#Ezra.8.15); [Neh. 8:2](/neh#Neh.8.2)). In after years, when the Jews were dispersed abroad, wherever they went they erected synagogues and kept up the stated services of worship ([Acts 9:20](/acts#Acts.9.20); [13:5](/acts#Acts.13.5); [17:1](/acts#Acts.17.1); [17:17](/acts#Acts.17.17); [18:4](/acts#Acts.18.4)). The form and internal arrangements of the synagogue would greatly depend on the wealth of the Jews who erected it, and on the place where it was built. “Yet there are certain traditional pecularities which have doubtless united together by a common resemblance the Jewish synagogues of all ages and countries. The arrangements for the women’s place in a separate gallery or behind a partition of lattice-work; the desk in the centre, where the reader, like Ezra in ancient days, from his ‘pulpit of wood,’ may ‘open the book in the sight of all of people and read in the book of the law of God distinctly, and give the sense, and cause them to understand the reading’ ([Neh. 8:4](/neh#Neh.8.4), [8](/neh#Neh.8.8)); the carefully closed ark on the side of the building nearest to Jerusalem, for the preservation of the rolls or manuscripts of the law; the seats all round the building, whence ‘the eyes of all them that are in the synagogue’ may ‘be fastened’ on him who speaks ([Luke 4:20](/luke#Luke.4.20)); the ‘chief seats’ ([Matt. 23:6](/matt#Matt.23.6)) which were appropriated to the ’ruler’ or ‘rulers’ of the synagogue, according as its organization may have been more or less complete;”, these were features common to all the synagogues.

 Where perfected into a system, the services of the synagogue, which were at the same hours as those of the temple, consisted, (1) of prayer, which formed a kind of liturgy, there were in all eighteen prayers; (2) the reading of the Scriptures in certain definite portions; and (3) the exposition of the portions read. (See [Luke 4:15](/luke#Luke.4.15), [22](/luke#Luke.4.22); [Acts 13:14](/acts#Acts.13.14).)

 The synagogue was also sometimes used as a court of judicature, in which the rulers presided ([Matt. 10:17](/matt#Matt.10.17); [Mark 5:22](/mark#Mark.5.22); [Luke 12:11](/luke#Luke.12.11); [21:12](/luke#Luke.21.12); [Acts 13:15](/acts#Acts.13.15); [22:19](/acts#Acts.22.19)); also as public schools.

 The establishment of synagogues wherever the Jews were found in sufficient numbers helped greatly to keep alive Israel’s hope of the coming of the Messiah, and to prepare the way for the spread of the gospel in other lands. The worship of the Christian Church was afterwards modelled after that of the synagogue.

 Christ and his disciples frequently taught in the synagogues ([Matt. 13:54](/matt#Matt.13.54); [Mark 6:2](/mark#Mark.6.2); [John 18:20](/john#John.18.20); [Acts 13:5](/acts#Acts.13.5), [15](/acts#Acts.13.15), [44](/acts#Acts.13.44); 14:1; 17:2-4, 10, 17; 18:4, 26; 19:8).

All these separate little kingdoms afterwards became subject to Damascus. In the time of the Romans, Syria included also a part of Palestine and Asia Minor.

 “From the historic annals now accessible to us, the history of Syria may be divided into three periods: The first, the period when the power of the Pharaohs was dominant over the fertile fields or plains of Syria and the merchant cities of Tyre and Sidon, and when such mighty conquerors as Thothmes III. and Rameses II. could claim dominion and levy tribute from the nations from the banks of the Euphrates to the borders of the Libyan desert. Second, this was followed by a short period of independence, when the Jewish nation in the south was growing in power, until it reached its early zenith in the golden days of Solomon; and when Tyre and Sidon were rich cities, sending their traders far and wide, over land and sea, as missionaries of civilization, while in the north the confederate tribes of the Hittites held back the armies of the kings of Assyria. The third, and to us most interesting, period is that during which the kings of Assyria were dominant over the plains of Syria; when Tyre, Sidon, Ashdod, and Jerusalem bowed beneath the conquering armies of Shalmaneser, Sargon, and Sennacherib; and when at last Memphis and Thebes yielded to the power of the rulers of Nineveh and Babylon, and the kings of Assyria completed with terrible fulness the bruising of the reed of Egypt so clearly foretold by the Hebrew prophets.”, Boscawen.",0.0,unmatched,unmatched,,syria_1122

Tabernacle 4,5877,t-p8.2,Tabernacle,"The sacred tent (Heb. mishkan, “the dwelling-place”); the movable tent-temple which Moses erected for the service of God, according to the “pattern” which God himself showed to him on the mount ([Ex. 25:9](/exod#Exod.25.9); [Heb. 8:5](/heb#Heb.8.5)). It is called “the tabernacle of the congregation,” rather “of meeting”, i.e., where God promised to meet with Israel ([Ex. 29:42](/exod#Exod.29.42)); the “tabernacle of the testimony” ([Ex. 38:21](/exod#Exod.38.21); [Num. 1:50](/num#Num.1.50)), which does not, however, designate the whole structure, but only the enclosure which contained the “ark of the testimony” ([Ex. 25:16](/exod#Exod.25.16), [22](/exod#Exod.25.22); [Num. 9:15](/num#Num.9.15)); the “tabernacle of witness” ([Num. 17:8](/num#Num.17.8)); the “house of the Lord” ([Deut. 23:18](/deut#Deut.23.18)); the “temple of the Lord” ([Josh. 6:24](/josh#Josh.6.24)); a “sanctuary” ([Ex. 25:8](/exod#Exod.25.8)).

 A particular account of the materials which the people provided for the erection and of the building itself is recorded in [Ex. 25](/exod#Exod.25)-40. The execution of the plan mysteriously given to Moses was intrusted to Bezaleel and Aholiab, who were specially endowed with wisdom and artistic skill, probably gained in Egypt, for this purpose ([Ex. 35:30-35](/exod#Exod.35.30)). The people provided materials for the tabernacle so abundantly that Moses was under the necessity of restraining them (36:6). These stores, from which they so liberally contributed for this purpose, must have consisted in a great part of the gifts which the Egyptians so readily bestowed on them on the eve of the Exodus (12:35, 36).

 The tabernacle was a rectangular enclosure, in length about 45 feet (i.e., reckoning a cubit at 18 inches) and in breadth and height about 15. Its two sides and its western end were made of boards of acacia wood, placed on end, resting in sockets of brass, the eastern end being left open ([Ex. 26:22](/exod#Exod.26.22)). This framework was covered with four coverings, the first of linen, in which figures of the symbolic cherubim were wrought with needlework in blue and purple and scarlet threads, and probably also with threads of gold ([Ex. 26:1-6](/exod#Exod.26.1); [36:8-13](/exod#Exod.36.8)). Above this was a second covering of twelve curtains of black goats’-hair cloth, reaching down on the outside almost to the ground ([Ex. 26:7-11](/exod#Exod.26.7)). The third covering was of rams’ skins dyed red, and the fourth was of badgers’ skins (Heb. tahash, i.e., the dugong, a species of seal), [Ex. 25:5](/exod#Exod.25.5); [26:14](/exod#Exod.26.14); [35:7](/exod#Exod.35.7), [23](/exod#Exod.35.23); [36:19](/exod#Exod.36.19); [39:34](/exod#Exod.39.34).

 Internally it was divided by a veil into two chambers, the exterior of which was called the holy place, also “the sanctuary” ([Heb. 9:2](/heb#Heb.9.2)) and the “first tabernacle” (6); and the interior, the holy of holies, “the holy place,” “the Holiest,” the “second tabernacle” ([Ex. 28:29](/exod#Exod.28.29); [Heb. 9:3](/heb#Heb.9.3), [7](/heb#Heb.9.7)). The veil separating these two chambers was a double curtain of the finest workmanship, which was never passed except by the high priest once a year, on the great Day of Atonement. The holy place was separated from the outer court which enclosed the tabernacle by a curtain, which hung over the six pillars which stood at the east end of the tabernacle, and by which it was entered.

 The order as well as the typical character of the services of the tabernacle are recorded in [Heb. 9](/heb#Heb.9); [10:19-22](/heb#Heb.10.19).

 The holy of holies, a cube of 10 cubits, contained the “ark of the testimony”, i.e., the oblong chest containing the two tables of stone, the pot of manna, and Aaron’s rod that budded.

 The holy place was the western and larger chamber of the tabernacle. Here were placed the table for the shewbread, the golden candlestick, and the golden altar of incense.

 Round about the tabernacle was a court, enclosed by curtains hung upon sixty pillars ([Ex. 27:9-18](/exod#Exod.27.9)). This court was 150 feet long and 75 feet broad. Within it were placed the altar of burnt offering, which measured 7 1/2 feet in length and breadth and 4 1/2 feet high, with horns at the four corners, and the laver of brass ([Ex. 30:18](/exod#Exod.30.18)), which stood between the altar and the tabernacle.

 The whole tabernacle was completed in seven months. On the first day of the first month of the second year after the Exodus, it was formally set up, and the cloud of the divine presence descended on it ([Ex. 39:22-43](/exod#Exod.39.22); [40:1-38](/exod#Exod.40.1)). It cost 29 talents 730 shekels of gold, 100 talents 1,775 shekels of silver, 70 talents 2,400 shekels of brass ([Ex. 38:24-31](/exod#Exod.38.24)).

 The tabernacle was so constructed that it could easily be taken down and conveyed from place to place during the wanderings in the wilderness. The first encampment of the Israelites after crossing the Jordan was at Gilgal, and there the tabernacle remained for seven years ([Josh. 4:19](/josh#Josh.4.19)). It was afterwards removed to Shiloh ([Josh. 18:1](/josh#Josh.18.1)), where it remained during the time of the Judges, till the days of Eli, when the ark, having been carried out into the camp when the Israelites were at war with the Philistines, was taken by the enemy ([1 Sam. 4](/1sam#1Sam.4)), and was never afterwards restored to its place in the tabernacle. The old tabernacle erected by Moses in the wilderness was transferred to Nob ([1 Sam. 21:1](/1sam#1Sam.21.1)), and after the destruction of that city by Saul (22:9; [1 Chr. 16:39](/1chr#1Chr.16.39), [40](/1chr#1Chr.16.40)), to Gibeon. It is mentioned for the last time in [1 Chr. 21:29](/1chr#1Chr.21.29). A new tabernacle was erected by David at Jerusalem ([2 Sam. 6:17](/2sam#2Sam.6.17); [1 Chr. 16:1](/1chr#1Chr.16.1)), and the ark was brought from Perez-uzzah and deposited in it ([2 Sam. 6:8-17](/2sam#2Sam.6.8); [2 Chr. 1:4](/2chr#2Chr.1.4)).

It is also called the “feast of ingathering” ([Ex. 23:16](/exod#Exod.23.16); [Deut. 16:13](/deut#Deut.16.13)). It was celebrated immediately after the harvest, in the month Tisri, and the celebration lasted for eight days ([Lev. 23:33-43](/lev#Lev.23.33)). During that period the people left their homes and lived in booths formed of the branches of trees. The sacrifices offered at this time are mentioned in [Num. 29:13-38](/num#Num.29.13). It was at the time of this feast that Solomon’s temple was dedicated ([1 Kings 8:2](/1kgs#1Kgs.8.2)). Mention is made of it after the return from the Captivity. This feast was designed (1) to be a memorial of the wilderness wanderings, when the people dwelt in booths ([Lev. 23:43](/lev#Lev.23.43)), and (2) to be a harvest thanksgiving ([Neh. 8:9-18](/neh#Neh.8.9)). The Jews, at a later time, introduced two appendages to the original festival, viz., (1) that of drawing water from the Pool of Siloam, and pouring it upon the altar ([John 7:2](/john#John.7.2), [37](/john#John.7.37)), as a memorial of the water from the rock in Horeb; and (2) of lighting the lamps at night, a memorial of the pillar of fire by night during their wanderings.

 “The feast of Tabernacles, the harvest festival of the Jewish Church, was the most popular and important festival after the Captivity. At Jerusalem it was a gala day. It was to the autumn pilgrims, who arrived on the 14th (of the month Tisri, the feast beginning on the 15th) day, like entrance into a silvan city. Roofs and courtyards, streets and squares, roads and gardens, were green with boughs of citron and myrtle, palm and willow. The booths recalled the pilgrimage through the wilderness.

Some, again, argue that Carthage was the place so named. There can be little doubt, however, that this is the name of a Phoenician port in Spain, between the two mouths of the Guadalquivir (the name given to the river by the Arabs, and meaning “the great wady” or water-course). It was founded by a Carthaginian colony, and was the farthest western harbour of Tyrian sailors. It was to this port Jonah’s ship was about to sail from Joppa. It has well been styled “the Peru of Tyrian adventure;” it abounded in gold and silver mines.

 It appears that this name also is used without reference to any locality. “Ships of Tarshish” is an expression sometimes denoting simply ships intended for a long voyage ([Isa. 23:1](/isa#Isa.23.1), [14](/isa#Isa.23.14)), ships of a large size (sea-going ships), whatever might be the port to which they sailed.

"Temple, Herod’s",5953,t-p96.16,"Temple, Herod’s","The temple erected by the exiles on their return from Babylon had stood for about five hundred years, when Herod the Great became king of Judea. The building had suffered considerably from natural decay as well as from the assaults of hostile armies, and Herod, desirous of gaining the favour of the Jews, proposed to rebuild it. This offer was accepted, and the work was begun (B.C. 18), and carried out at great labour and expense, and on a scale of surpassing splendour. The main part of the building was completed in ten years, but the erection of the outer courts and the embellishment of the whole were carried on during the entire period of our Lord’s life on earth ([John 2:16](/john#John.2.16), [19-21](/john#John.2.19)), and the temple was completed only A.D. 65. But it was not long permitted to exist. Within forty years after our Lord’s crucifixion, his prediction of its overthrow was accomplished ([Luke 19](/luke#Luke.19): 41-44). The Roman legions took the city of Jerusalem by storm, and notwithstanding the strenuous efforts Titus made to preserve the temple, his soldiers set fire to it in several places, and it was utterly destroyed (A.D. 70), and was never rebuilt.

 Several remains of Herod’s stately temple have by recent explorations been brought to light. It had two courts, one intended for the Israelites only, and the other, a large outer court, called “the court of the Gentiles,” intended for the use of strangers of all nations. These two courts were separated by a low wall, as Josephus states, some 4 1/2 feet high, with thirteen openings. Along the top of this dividing wall, at regular intervals, were placed pillars bearing in Greek an inscription to the effect that no stranger was, on the pain of death, to pass from the court of the Gentiles into that of the Jews. At the entrance to a graveyard at the north-western angle of the Haram wall, a stone was discovered by M. Ganneau in 1871, built into the wall, bearing the following inscription in Greek capitals: “No stranger is to enter within the partition wall and enclosure around the sanctuary. Whoever is caught will be responsible to himself for his death, which will ensue.”

 There can be no doubt that the stone thus discovered was one of those originally placed on the boundary wall which separated the Jews from the Gentiles, of which Josephus speaks.

 It is of importance to notice that the word rendered “sanctuary” in the inscription was used in a specific sense of the inner court, the court of the Israelites, and is the word rendered “temple” in [John 2:15](/john#John.2.15) and [Acts 21:28](/acts#Acts.21.28), [29](/acts#Acts.21.29). When Paul speaks of the middle wall of partition ([Eph. 2:14](/eph#Eph.2.14)), he probably makes allusion to this dividing wall. Within this partition wall stood the temple proper, consisting of, (1) the court of the women, 8 feet higher than the outer court; (2) 10 feet higher than this court was the court of Israel; (3) the court of the priests, again 3 feet higher; and lastly (4) the temple floor, 8 feet above that; thus in all 29 feet above the level of the outer court.

 The summit of Mount Moriah, on which the temple stood, is now occupied by the Haram esh-Sherif, i.e., “the sacred enclosure.” This enclosure is about 1,500 feet from north to south, with a breadth of about 1,000 feet, covering in all a space of about 35 acres. About the centre of the enclosure is a raised platform, 16 feet above the surrounding space, and paved with large stone slabs, on which stands the Mohammedan mosque called Kubbet es-Sahkra i.e., the “Dome of the Rock,” or the Mosque of Omar. This mosque covers the site of Solomon’s temple. In the centre of the dome there is a bare, projecting rock, the highest part of Moriah (q.v.), measuring 60 feet by 40, standing 6 feet above the floor of the mosque, called the sahkra, i.e., “rock.” Over this rock the altar of burnt-offerings stood. It was the threshing-floor of Araunah the Jebusite. The exact position on this “sacred enclosure” which the temple occupied has not been yet definitely ascertained. Some affirm that Herod’s temple covered the site of Solomon’s temple and palace, and in addition enclosed a square of 300 feet at the south-western angle. The temple courts thus are supposed to have occupied the southern portion of the “enclosure,” forming in all a square of more than 900 feet. It is argued by others that Herod’s temple occupied a square of 600 feet at the south-west of the “enclosure.”",0.0,unmatched,unmatched,,
"Temple, Solomon’s",5954,t-p101.1,"Temple, Solomon’s","Before his death David had “with all his might” provided materials in great abundance for the building of the temple on the summit of Mount Moriah ([1 Chr. 22:14](/1chr#1Chr.22.14); [29:4](/1chr#1Chr.29.4); [2 Chr. 3:1](/2chr#2Chr.3.1)), on the east of the city, on the spot where Abraham had offered up Isaac ([Gen. 22:1-14](/gen#Gen.22.1)). In the beginning of his reign Solomon set about giving effect to the desire that had been so earnestly cherished by his father, and prepared additional materials for the building. From subterranean quarries at Jerusalem he obtained huge blocks of stone for the foundations and walls of the temple. These stones were prepared for their places in the building under the eye of Tyrian master-builders. He also entered into a compact with Hiram II., king of Tyre, for the supply of whatever else was needed for the work, particularly timber from the forests of Lebanon, which was brought in great rafts by the sea to Joppa, whence it was dragged to Jerusalem ([1 Kings 5](/1kgs#1Kgs.5)). As the hill on which the temple was to be built did not afford sufficient level space, a huge wall of solid masonry of great height, in some places more than 200 feet high, was raised across the south of the hill, and a similar wall on the eastern side, and in the spaces between were erected many arches and pillars, thus raising up the general surface to the required level. Solomon also provided for a sufficient water supply for the temple by hewing in the rocky hill vast cisterns, into which water was conveyed by channels from the “pools” near Bethlehem. One of these cisterns, the “great sea,” was capable of containing three millions of gallons. The overflow was led off by a conduit to the Kidron.

 In all these preparatory undertakings a space of about three years was occupied; and now the process of the erection of the great building began, under the direction of skilled Phoenician builders and workmen, in the fourth year of Solomon’s reign, 480 years after the Exodus ([1 Kings 6](/1kgs#1Kgs.6); [2 Chr. 3](/2chr#2Chr.3)). Many thousands of labourers and skilled artisans were employed in the work. Stones prepared in the quarries underneath the city ([1 Kings 5:17](/1kgs#1Kgs.5.17), [18](/1kgs#1Kgs.5.18)) of huge dimension (see QUARRIES) were gradually placed on the massive walls, and closely fitted together without any mortar between, till the whole structure was completed. No sound of hammer or axe or any tool of iron was heard as the structure arose (6:7). “Like some tall palm the noiseless fabric sprang.” The building was 60 cubits long, 20 cubits wide, and 30 cubits high. The engineers of the Palestine Exploration Fund, in their explorations around the temple area, discovered what is believed to have been the “chief corner stone” of the temple, “the most interesting stone in the world.” It lies at the bottom of the south-eastern angle, and is 3 feet 8 inches high by 14 feet long. It rests on the solid rock at a depth of 79 feet 3 inches below the present surface. In examining the walls the engineers were “struck with admiration at the vastness of the blocks and the general excellence of the workmanship.”

 At length, in the autumn of the eleventh year of his reign, seven and a half years after it had been begun, the temple was completed in all its architectural magnificence and beauty. For thirteen years there it stood, on the summit of Moriah, silent and unused. The reasons for this strange delay in its consecration are unknown. At the close of these thirteen years preparations for the dedication of the temple were made on a scale of the greatest magnificence. The ark was solemnly brought from the tent in which David had deposited it to the place prepared for it in the temple, and the glory-cloud, the symbol of the divine presence, filled the house. Then Solomon ascended a platform which had been erected for him, in the sight of all the people, and lifting up his hands to heaven poured out his heart to God in prayer ([1 Kings 8](/1kgs#1Kgs.8); [2 Chr. 6](/2chr#2Chr.6), [7](/2chr#2Chr.7)). The feast of dedication, which lasted seven days, followed by the feast of tabernacles, marked a new era in the history of Israel. On the eighth day of the feast of tabernacles, Solomon dismissed the vast assemblage of the people, who returned to their homes filled with joy and gladness, “Had Solomon done no other service beyond the building of the temple, he would still have influenced the religious life of his people down to the latest days. It was to them a perpetual reminder and visible symbol of God’s presence and protection, a strong bulwark of all the sacred traditions of the law, a witness to duty, an impulse to historic study, an inspiration of sacred song.”

"Temple, the Second",5961,t-p107.16,"Temple, the Second","After the return from captivity, under Zerubbabel (q.v.) and the high priest Jeshua, arrangements were almost immediately made to reorganize the long-desolated kingdom. The body of pilgrims, forming a band of 42,360, including children, having completed the long and dreary journey of some four months, from the banks of the Euphrates to Jerusalem, were animated in all their proceeding by a strong religious impulse, and therefore one of their first cares was to restore their ancient worship by rebuilding the temple. On the invitation of Zerubbabel, the governor, who showed them a remarkable example of liberality by contributing personally 1,000 golden darics (probably about $6,000), besides other gifts, the people with great enthusiasm poured their gifts into the sacred treasury ([Ezra 2](/ezra#Ezra.2)). First they erected and dedicated the altar of Jehovah on the exact spot where it had formerly stood, and they then cleared away the charred heaps of debris which occupied the site of the old temple; and in the second month of the second year (B.C. 535), amid great public excitement and rejoicing ([Ps. 116](/ps#Ps.116); [117](/ps#Ps.117); [118](/ps#Ps.118)), the foundations of the second temple were laid. A wide interest was felt in this great movement, although it was regarded with mingled feelings by the spectators ([Hag. 2:3](/hag#Hag.2.3); [Zech. 4:10](/zech#Zech.4.10)). The Samaritans made proposals for a co-operation in the work. Zerubbabel and Jeshua and the elders, however, declined all such cooperation: Judah must build the temple without help. Immediately evil reports were spread regarding the Jews. The Samaritans sought to “frustrate their purpose” ([Ezra 4:5](/ezra#Ezra.4.5)), and sent messengers to Ecbatana and Susa, with the result that the work was suspended. Seven years after this Cyrus died ingloriously, having killed himself in Syria when on his way back from Egypt to the east, and was succeeded by his son Cambyses (B.C. 529-522), on whose death the “false Smerdis,” an imposter, occupied the throne for some seven or eight months, and then Darius Hystaspes became king (B.C. 522). In the second year of this monarch the work of rebuilding the temple was resumed and carried forward to its completion ([Ezra 5](/ezra#Ezra.5): 6-17; 6:1-15), under the stimulus of the earnest counsels and admonitions of the prophets Haggai and Zechariah. It was ready for consecration in the spring of B.C. 516, twenty years after the return from captivity.

 This second temple had not the ark, the Urim and Thummim, the holy oil, the sacred fire, the tables of stone, the pot of manna, and Aaron’s rod. As in the tabernacle, there was in it only one golden lamp for the holy place, one table of shewbread, and the incense altar, with golden censers, and many of the vessels of gold that had belonged to Solomon’s temple that had been carried to Babylon but restored by Cyrus ([Ezra 1:7-11](/ezra#Ezra.1.7)).

 This second temple also differed from the first in that, while in the latter there were numerous “trees planted in the courts of the Lord,” there were none in the former. The second temple also had for the first time a space, being a part of the outer court, provided for proselytes who were worshippers of Jehovah, although not subject to the laws of Judaism.

 The temple, when completed, was consecrated amid great rejoicings on the part of all the people ([Ezra 6:16](/ezra#Ezra.6.16)), although there were not wanting outward evidences that the Jews were no longer an independent people, but were subject to a foreign power.

 [Hag. 2:9](/hag#Hag.2.9) is rightly rendered in the Revised Version, “The latter glory of this house shall be greater than the former,” instead of, “The glory of this latter house,” etc., in the Authorized Version. The temple, during the different periods of its existence, is regarded as but one house, the one only house of God (comp. 2:3). The glory here predicted is spiritual glory and not material splendour. “Christ himself, present bodily in the temple on Mount Zion during his life on earth, present spiritually in the Church now, present in the holy city, the heavenly Jerusalem, of which he is the temple, calling forth spiritual worship and devotion is the glory here predicted” (Perowne).",0.0,unmatched,unmatched,,

Temptation 2,5964,t-p112.2,Temptation,"Ordinarily, however, the word means solicitation to that which is evil, and hence Satan is called “the tempter” ([Matt. 4:3](/matt#Matt.4.3)). Our Lord was in this way tempted in the wilderness. That temptation was not internal, but by a real, active, subtle being. It was not self-sought. It was submitted to as an act of obedience on his part. “Christ was led, driven. An unseen personal force bore him a certain violence is implied in the words” ([Matt. 4:1-11](/matt#Matt.4.1)).

 The scene of the temptation of our Lord is generally supposed to have been the mountain of Quarantania (q.v.), “a high and precipitous wall of rock, 1,200 or 1,500 feet above the plain west of Jordan, near Jericho.”

 Temptation is common to all ([Dan. 12:10](/dan#Dan.12.10); [Zech. 13:9](/zech#Zech.13.9); [Ps. 66:10](/ps#Ps.66.10); [Luke 22:31](/luke#Luke.22.31), [40](/luke#Luke.22.40); [Heb. 11:17](/heb#Heb.11.17); [James 1:12](/jas#Jas.1.12); [1 Pet. 1:7](/1pet#1Pet.1.7); [4:12](/1pet#1Pet.4.12)).

She pointed it out to the soldiers, and alleged that David was confined to his bed by a sudden illness ([1 Sam. 19:13-16](/1sam#1Sam.19.13)). Thus she gained time for David’s escape. It seems strange to read of teraphim, images of ancestors, preserved for superstitious purposes, being in the house of David. Probably they had been stealthily brought by Michal from her father’s house. “Perhaps,” says Bishop Wordsworth, “Saul, forsaken by God and possessed by the evil spirit, had resorted to teraphim (as he afterwards resorted to witchcraft); and God overruled evil for good, and made his very teraphim (by the hand of his own daughter) to be an instrument for David’s escape.”, Deane’s David, p. 32.

"Thessalonians, Epistles to the",5992,t-p141.4,"Thessalonians, Epistles to the","The first epistle to the Thessalonians was the first of all Paul’s epistles. It was in all probability written from Corinth, where he abode a “long time” ([Acts 18:11](/acts#Acts.18.11), [18](/acts#Acts.18.18)), early in the period of his residence there, about the end of A.D. 52.

 The occasion of its being written was the return of Timotheus from Macedonia, bearing tidings from Thessalonica regarding the state of the church there ([Acts 18:1-5](/acts#Acts.18.1); [1 Thess. 3:6](/1thess#1Thess.3.6)). While, on the whole, the report of Timothy was encouraging, it also showed that divers errors and misunderstandings regarding the tenor of Paul’s teaching had crept in amongst them. He addresses them in this letter with the view of correcting these errors, and especially for the purpose of exhorting them to purity of life, reminding them that their sanctification was the great end desired by God regarding them.

 The subscription erroneously states that this epistle was written from Athens.

 The second epistle to the Thessalonians was probably also written from Corinth, and not many months after the first.

 The occasion of the writing of this epistle was the arrival of tidings that the tenor of the first epistle had been misunderstood, especially with reference to the second advent of Christ. The Thessalonians had embraced the idea that Paul had taught that “the day of Christ was at hand”, that Christ’s coming was just about to happen. This error is corrected (2:1-12), and the apostle prophetically announces what first must take place. “The apostasy” was first to arise.

Thessalonica,5993,t-p146.1,Thessalonica,"A large and populous city on the Thermaic bay. It was the capital of one of the four Roman districts of Macedonia, and was ruled by a praetor. It was named after Thessalonica, the wife of Cassander, who built the city. She was so called by her father, Philip, because he first heard of her birth on the day of his gaining a victory over the Thessalians. On his second missionary journey, Paul preached in the synagogue here, the chief synagogue of the Jews in that part of Macedonia, and laid the foundations of a church ([Acts 17:1-4](/acts#Acts.17.1); [1 Thes. 1:9](/1thess#1Thess.1.9)). The violence of the Jews drove him from the city, when he fled to Berea ([Acts 17:5-10](/acts#Acts.17.5)). The “rulers of the city” before whom the Jews “drew Jason,” with whom Paul and Silas lodged, are in the original called politarchai, an unusual word, which was found, however, inscribed on an arch in Thessalonica. This discovery confirms the accuracy of the historian. Paul visited the church here on a subsequent occasion (20:1-3). This city long retained its importance.

It is mentioned only three times in the history of our Lord ([John 6:1](/john#John.6.1), [23](/john#John.6.23); 21:1).

 In 1837 about one-half of the inhabitants perished by an earthquake. The population of the city is now about six thousand, nearly the one-half being Jews. “We do not read that our Lord ever entered this city. The reason of this is probably to be found in the fact that it was practically a heathen city, though standing upon Jewish soil. Herod, its founder, had brought together the arts of Greece, the idolatry of Rome, and the gross lewdness of Asia. There were in it a theatre for the performance of comedies, a forum, a stadium, a palace roofed with gold in imitation of those in Italy, statues of the Roman gods, and busts of the deified emperors. He who was not sent but to the lost sheep of the house of Israel might well hold himself aloof from such scenes as these” (Manning’s Those Holy Fields).

 After the fall of Jerusalem (A.D. 70), Tiberias became one of the chief residences of the Jews in Palestine. It was for more than three hundred years their metropolis. From about A.D. 150 the Sanhedrin settled here, and established rabbinical schools, which rose to great celebrity. Here the Jerusalem (or Palestinian) Talmud was compiled about the beginning of the fifth century. To this same rabbinical school also we are indebted for the Masora, a “body of traditions which transmitted the readings of the Hebrew text of the Old Testament, and preserved, by means of the vowel-system, the pronunciation of the Hebrew.” In its original form, and in all manuscripts, the Hebrew is written without vowels; hence, when it ceased to be a spoken language, the importance of knowing what vowels to insert between the consonants.

He is first brought into notice at the time of Paul’s second visit to Lystra (16:2), where he probably resided, and where it seems he was converted during Paul’s first visit to that place ([1 Tim. 1:2](/1tim#1Tim.1.2); [2 Tim. 3:11](/2tim#2Tim.3.11)). The apostle having formed a high opinion of his “own son in the faith,” arranged that he should become his companion ([Acts 16:3](/acts#Acts.16.3)), and took and circumcised him, so that he might conciliate the Jews. He was designated to the office of an evangelist ([1 Tim. 4:14](/1tim#1Tim.4.14)), and went with Paul in his journey through Phrygia, Galatia, and Mysia; also to Troas and Philippi and Berea ([Acts 17:14](/acts#Acts.17.14)).

When the apostle was a prisoner at Rome, Timothy joined him ([Phil. 1:1](/phil#Phil.1.1)), where it appears he also suffered imprisonment ([Heb. 13:23](/heb#Heb.13.23)). During the apostle’s second imprisonment he wrote to Timothy, asking him to rejoin him as soon as possible, and to bring with him certain things which he had left at Troas, his cloak and parchments ([2 Tim. 4:13](/2tim#2Tim.4.13)).

Josephus, the Jewish historian (Ant. 8:13, 2), however, supposes that Tishbi was some place in the land of Gilead.

Tithe,6057,t-p208.3,Tithe,"A tenth of the produce of the earth consecrated and set apart for special purposes. The dedication of a tenth to God was recognized as a duty before the time of Moses.

 The first Mosaic law on this subject is recorded in [Lev. 27:30-32](/lev#Lev.27.30). Subsequent legislation regulated the destination of the tithes ([Num. 18:21-24](/num#Num.18.21), [26-28](/num#Num.18.26); [Deut. 12:5](/deut#Deut.12.5), [6](/deut#Deut.12.6), [11](/deut#Deut.12.11), [17](/deut#Deut.12.17); 14:22, 23). The paying of the tithes was an important part of the Jewish religious worship. In the days of Hezekiah one of the first results of the reformation of religion was the eagerness with which the people brought in their tithes ([2 Chr. 31:5](/2chr#2Chr.31.5), [6](/2chr#2Chr.31.6)). The neglect of this duty was sternly rebuked by the prophets ([Amos 4:4](/amos#Amos.4.4); [Mal. 3:8-10](/mal#Mal.3.8)). It cannot be affirmed that the Old Testament law of tithes is binding on the Christian Church, nevertheless the principle of this law remains, and is incorporated in the gospel ([1 Cor. 9:13](/1cor#1Cor.9.13), [14](/1cor#1Cor.9.14)); and if, as is the case, the motive that ought to prompt to liberality in the cause of religion and of the service of God be greater now than in Old Testament times, then Christians outght to go beyond the ancient Hebrew in consecrating both themselves and their substance to God.

Both letters are principally occupied in describing the qualifications to be sought for in those whom they should appoint to offices in the church; and the ingredients of this description are in both letters nearly the same. Timothy and Titus are likewise cautioned against the same prevailing corruptions, and in particular against the same misdirection of their cares and studies. This affinity obtains not only in the subject of the letters, which from the similarity of situation in the persons to whom they were addressed might be expected to be somewhat alike, but extends in a great variety of instances to the phrases and expressions. The writer accosts his two friends with the same salutation, and passes on to the business of his letter by the same transition (comp.

 The date of its composition may be concluded from the circumstance that it was written after Paul’s visit to Crete ([Titus 1:5](/titus#Titus.1.5)).

It is a migratory bird ([Jer. 8:7](/jer#Jer.8.7); [Cant. 2:11](/song#Song.2.11), [12](/song#Song.2.12)). “Search the glades and valleys, even by sultry Jordan, at the end of March, and not a turtle-dove is to be seen. Return in the second week of April, and clouds of doves are feeding on the clovers of the plain. They overspread the whole face of the land.” “Immediately on its arrival it pours forth from every garden, grove, and wooded hill its melancholy yet soothing ditty unceasingly from early dawn till sunset. It is from its plaintive and continuous note, doubtless, that David, pouring forth his heart’s sorrow to God, compares himself to a turtle-dove” ([Ps. 74:19](/ps#Ps.74.19)).",0.0,unmatched,unmatched,,

Tyre,6119,t-p275.2,Tyre,"A rock, now es-Sur; an ancient Phoenician city, about 23 miles, in a direct line, north of Acre, and 20 south of Sidon. Sidon was the oldest Phoenician city, but Tyre had a longer and more illustrious history. The commerce of the whole world was gathered into the warehouses of Tyre. “Tyrian merchants were the first who ventured to navigate the Mediterranean waters; and they founded their colonies on the coasts and neighbouring islands of the AEgean Sea, in Greece, on the northern coast of Africa, at Carthage and other places, in Sicily and Corsica, in Spain at Tartessus, and even beyond the pillars of Hercules at Gadeira (Cadiz)” (Driver’s Isaiah). In the time of David a friendly alliance was entered into between the Hebrews and the Tyrians, who were long ruled over by their native kings ([2 Sam. 5:11](/2sam#2Sam.5.11); [1 Kings 5:1](/1kgs#1Kgs.5.1); [2 Chr. 2:3](/2chr#2Chr.2.3)).

 Tyre consisted of two distinct parts, a rocky fortress on the mainland, called “Old Tyre,” and the city, built on a small, rocky island about half-a-mile distant from the shore. It was a place of great strength. It was besieged by Shalmaneser, who was assisted by the Phoenicians of the mainland, for five years, and by Nebuchadnezzar (B.C. 586-573) for thirteen years, apparently without success. It afterwards fell under the power of Alexander the Great, after a siege of seven months, but continued to maintain much of its commercial importance till the Christian era. It is referred to in [Matt. 11:21](/matt#Matt.11.21) and [Acts 12:20](/acts#Acts.12.20). In A.D. 1291 it was taken by the Saracens, and has remained a desolate ruin ever since.

 “The purple dye of Tyre had a worldwide celebrity on account of the durability of its beautiful tints, and its manufacture proved a source of abundant wealth to the inhabitants of that city.”

 Both Tyre and Sidon “were crowded with glass-shops, dyeing and weaving establishments; and among their cunning workmen not the least important class were those who were celebrated for the engraving of precious stones.” ([2 Chr. 2:7](/2chr#2Chr.2.7), [14](/2chr#2Chr.2.14)).

 The wickedness and idolatry of this city are frequently denounced by the prophets, and its final destruction predicted ([Isa. 23:1](/isa#Isa.23.1); [Jer. 25:22](/jer#Jer.25.22); [Ezek. 26](/ezek#Ezek.26); [28:1-19](/ezek#Ezek.28.1); [Amos 1:9](/amos#Amos.1.9), [10](/amos#Amos.1.10); [Zech. 9:2-4](/zech#Zech.9.2)).

 Here a church was founded soon after the death of Stephen, and Paul, on his return from his third missionary journey spent a week in intercourse with the disciples there ([Acts 21:4](/acts#Acts.21.4)). Here the scene at Miletus was repeated on his leaving them. They all, with their wives and children, accompanied him to the sea-shore. The sea-voyage of the apostle terminated at Ptolemais, about 38 miles from Tyre. Thence he proceeded to Caesarea ([Acts 21:5-8](/acts#Acts.21.5)).

 “It is noticed on monuments as early as B.C. 1500, and claiming, according to Herodotus, to have been founded about B.C. 2700. It had two ports still existing, and was of commercial importance in all ages, with colonies at Carthage (about B.C. 850) and all over the Mediterranean. It was often attacked by Egypt and Assyria, and taken by Alexander the Great after a terrible siege in B.C. 332. It is now a town of 3,000 inhabitants, with ancient tombs and a ruined cathedral. A short Phoenician text of the fourth century B.C. is the only monument yet recovered.”",0.0,place,tyre_1184,,tyre_1184

This valley, now filled up with a vast accumulation of rubbish, and almost a plain, was spanned by bridges, the most noted of which was Zion Bridge, which was probably the ordinary means of communication between the royal palace on Zion and the temple. A fragment of the arch (q.v.) of this bridge (called “Robinson’s Arch”), where it projects from the sanctuary wall, was discovered by Robinson in 1839. This arch was destroyed by the Romans when Jerusalem was taken.

 The western wall of the temple area rose up from the bottom of this valley to the height of 84 feet, where it was on a level with the area, and above this, and as a continuance of it, the wall of Solomon’s cloister rose to the height of about 50 feet, “so that this section of the wall would originally present to view a stupendous mass of masonry scarcely to be surpassed by any mural masonry in the world.”",0.0,unmatched,unmatched,,

It was in reality a two-horned animal; but the exact reference of the word so rendered (reem) is doubtful.

Ur,6131,u-p9.2,Ur,"Light, or the moon city, a city “of the Chaldees,” the birthplace of Haran ([Gen. 11:28](/gen#Gen.11.28), [31](/gen#Gen.11.31)), the largest city of Shinar or northern Chaldea, and the principal commercial centre of the country as well as the centre of political power. It stood near the mouth of the Euphrates, on its western bank, and is represented by the mounds (of bricks cemented by bitumen) of el-Mugheir, i.e., “the bitumined,” or “the town of bitumen,” now 150 miles from the sea and some 6 miles from the Euphrates, a little above the point where it receives the Shat el-Hie, an affluent from the Tigris. It was formerly a maritime city, as the waters of the Persian Gulf reached thus far inland. Ur was the port of Babylonia, whence trade was carried on with the dwellers on the gulf, and with the distant countries of India, Ethiopia, and Egypt. It was abandoned about B.C. 500, but long continued, like Erech, to be a great sacred cemetery city, as is evident from the number of tombs found there.

 The oldest king of Ur known to us is Ur-Ba’u (servant of the goddess Ba’u), as Hommel reads the name, or Ur-Gur, as others read it. He lived some twenty-eight hundred years B.C., and took part in building the famous temple of the moon-god Sin in Ur itself. The illustration here given represents his cuneiform inscription, written in the Sumerian language, and stamped upon every brick of the temple in Ur. It reads: “Ur-Ba’u, king of Ur, who built the temple of the moon-god.”

 “Ur was consecrated to the worship of Sin, the Babylonian moon-god. It shared this honour, however, with another city, and this city was Haran, or Harran. Harran was in Mesopotamia, and took its name from the highroad which led through it from the east to the west. The name is Babylonian, and bears witness to its having been founded by a Babylonian king. The same witness is still more decisively borne by the worship paid in it to the Babylonian moon-god and by its ancient temple of Sin. Indeed, the temple of the moon-god at Harran was perhaps even more famous in the Assyrian and Babylonian world than the temple of the moon-god at Ur.

 “Between Ur and Harran there must, consequently, have been a close connection in early times, the record of which has not yet been recovered. It may be that Harran owed its foundation to a king of Ur; at any rate the two cities were bound together by the worship of the same deity, the closest and most enduring bond of union that existed in the ancient world. That Terah should have migrated from Ur to Harran, therefore, ceases to be extraordinary. If he left Ur at all, it was the most natural place to which to go. It was like passing from one court of a temple into another.

 “Such a remarkable coincidence between the Biblical narrative and the evidence of archaeological research cannot be the result of chance. The narrative must be historical; no writer of late date, even if he were a Babylonian, could have invented a story so exactly in accordance with what we now know to have been the truth. For a story of the kind to have been the invention of Palestinian tradition is equally impossible. To the unprejudiced mind there is no escape from the conclusion that the history of the migration of Terah from Ur to Harran is founded on fact” (Sayce).",0.0,place,ur_1189,,ur_1189

This word is not found in the Bible, nevertheless, as frequent references are made in this work to various ancient as well as modern versions, it is fitting that some brief account should be given of the most important of these. These versions are important helps to the right interpretation of the Word.

 1. The Targums. After the return from the Captivity, the Jews, no longer familiar with the old Hebrew, required that their Scriptures should be translated for them into the Chaldaic or Aramaic language and interpreted. These translations and paraphrases were at first oral, but they were afterwards reduced to writing, and thus targums, i.e., “versions” or “translations”, have come down to us. The chief of these are,",0.0,unmatched,unmatched,,
Version 1,6191,v-p16.3,Version,"The Onkelos Targum, i.e., the targum of Akelas=Aquila, a targum so called to give it greater popularity by comparing it with the Greek translation of Aquila mentioned below. This targum originated about the second century after Christ.",1.0,unmatched,unmatched,,
Version 2,6192,v-p16.3,Version,"The targum of Jonathan ben Uzziel comes next to that of Onkelos in respect of age and value. It is more a paraphrase on the Prophets, however, than a translation. Both of these targums issued from the Jewish school which then flourished at Babylon.

 2. The Greek Versions.",2.0,unmatched,unmatched,,
Version 3,6193,v-p16.3,Version,"The oldest of these is the Septuagint, usually quoted as the LXX. The origin of this the most important of all the versions is involved in much obscurity. It derives its name from the popular notion that seventy-two translators were employed on it by the direction of Ptolemy Philadelphus, king of Egypt, and that it was accomplished in seventy-two days, for the use of the Jews residing in that country. There is no historical warrant for this notion. It is, however, an established fact that this version was made at Alexandria; that it was begun about 280 B.C., and finished about 200 or 150 B.C.; that it was the work of a number of translators who differed greatly both in their knowledge of Hebrew and of Greek; and that from the earliest times it has borne the name of “The Septuagint”, i.e., The Seventy.

 “This version, with all its defects, must be of the greatest interest, (a) as preserving evidence for the text far more ancient than the oldest Hebrew manuscripts; (b) as the means by which the Greek Language was wedded to Hebrew thought; (c) as the source of the great majority of quotations from the Old Testament by writers of the New Testament.",3.0,unmatched,unmatched,,
Version 4,6194,v-p16.3,Version,"The New Testament manuscripts fall into two divisions, Uncials, written in Greek capitals, with no distinction at all between the different words, and very little even between the different lines; and Cursives, in small Greek letters, and with divisions of words and lines. The change between the two kinds of Greek writing took place about the tenth century. Only five manuscripts of the New Testament approaching to completeness are more ancient than this dividing date. The first, numbered A, is the Alexandrian manuscript. Though brought to this country by Cyril Lucar, patriarch of Constantinople, as a present to Charles I., it is believed that it was written, not in that capital, but in Alexandria; whence its title. It is now dated in the fifth century A.D. The second, known as B, is the Vatican manuscript. The Third, C, or the Ephraem manuscript, was so called because it was written over the writings of Ephraem, a Syrian theological author, a practice very common in the days when writing materials were scarce and dear. It is believed that it belongs to the fifth century, and perhaps a slightly earlier period of it than the manuscript A. The fourth, D, or the manuscript of Beza, was so called because it belonged to the reformer Beza, who found it in the monastery of St. Irenaeus at Lyons in 1562 A.D. It is imperfect, and is dated in the sixth century. The fifth (called Aleph) is the Sinaitic manuscript.

 3. The Syriac Versions.

 4. The Latin Versions. A Latin version of the Scriptures, called the “Old Latin,” which originated in North Africa, was in common use in the time of Tertullian (A.D. 150). Of this there appear to have been various copies or recensions made. That made in Italy, and called the Itala, was reckoned the most accurate. This translation of the Old Testament seems to have been made not from the original Hebrew but from the LXX.

 This version became greatly corrupted by repeated transcription, and to remedy the evil Jerome (A.D. 329-420) was requested by Damasus, the bishop of Rome, to undertake a complete revision of it. It met with opposition at first, but was at length, in the seventh century, recognized as the “Vulgate” version. It appeared in a printed from about A.D. 1455, the first book that ever issued from the press. The Council of Trent (1546) declared it “authentic.” It subsequently underwent various revisions, but that which was executed (1592) under the sanction of Pope Clement VIII. was adopted as the basis of all subsequent editions. It is regarded as the sacred original in the Roman Catholic Church. All modern European versions have been more or less influenced by the Vulgate. This version reads ipsa_ instead of _ipse in [Gen. 3:15](/gen#Gen.3.15), “She shall bruise thy head.”

 5. There are several other ancient versions which are of importance for Biblical critics, but which we need not mention particularly, such as the Ethiopic, in the fourth century, from the LXX.; two Egyptian versions, about the fourth century, the Memphitic, circulated in Lower Egypt, and the Thebaic, designed for Upper Egypt, both from the Greek; the Gothic, written in the German language, but with the Greek alphabet, by Ulphilas (died A.D. 388), of which only fragments of the Old Testament remain; the Armenian, about A.D. 400; and the Slavonic, in the ninth century, for ancient Moravia. Other ancient versions, as the Arabic, the Persian, and the Anglo-Saxon, may be mentioned.

 6. The history of the English versions begins properly with Wyckliffe. Portions, however, of the Scriptures were rendered into Saxon (as the Gospel according to John, by Bede, A.D. 735), and also into English (by Orme, called the “Ormulum,” a portion of the Gospels and of the Acts in the form of a metrical paraphrase, toward the close of the seventh century), long before Wyckliffe; but it is to him that the honour belongs of having first rendered the whole Bible into English (A.D. 1380). This version was made from the Vulgate, and renders [Gen. 3:15](/gen#Gen.3.15) after that Version, “She shall trede thy head.”

 This was followed by Tyndale’s translation (1525-1531); Miles Coverdale’s (1535-1553); Thomas Matthew’s (1537), really, however, the work of John Rogers, the first martyr under the reign of Queen Mary. This was properly the first Authorized Version, Henry VIII. having ordered a copy of it to be got for every church. This took place in less than a year after Tyndale was martyred for the crime of translating the Scriptures. In 1539 Richard Taverner published a revised edition of Matthew’s Bible. The Great Bible, so called from its great size, called also Cranmer’s Bible, was published in 1539 and 1568. In the strict sense, the “Great Bible” is “the only authorized version; for the Bishops’ Bible and the present Bible [the A.V.] never had the formal sanction of royal authority.” Next in order was the Geneva version (1557-1560); the Bishops’ Bible (1568); the Rheims and Douai versions, under Roman Catholic auspices (1582, 1609); the Authorized Version (1611); and the Revised Version of the New Testament in 1880 and of the Old Testament in 1884.",4.0,unmatched,unmatched,,

Vine,6196,v-p28.5,Vine,"One of the most important products of Palestine. The first mention of it is in the history of Noah ([Gen. 9:20](/gen#Gen.9.20)). It is afterwards frequently noticed both in the Old and New Testaments, and in the ruins of terraced vineyards there are evidences that it was extensively cultivated by the Jews. It was cultivated in Palestine before the Israelites took possession of it. The men sent out by Moses brought with them from the Valley of Eshcol a cluster of grapes so large that “they bare it between two upon a staff” ([Num. 13](/num#Num.13): 23). The vineyards of En-gedi ([Cant. 1:14](/song#Song.1.14)), Heshbon, Sibmah, Jazer, Elealeh ([Isa. 16:8-10](/isa#Isa.16.8); [Jer. 48:32](/jer#Jer.48.32), [34](/jer#Jer.48.34)), and Helbon ([Ezek. 27:18](/ezek#Ezek.27.18)), as well as of Eshcol, were celebrated.

 The Church is compared to a vine ([Ps. 80:8](/ps#Ps.80.8)), and Christ says of himself, “I am the vine” ([John 15:1](/john#John.15.1)). In one of his parables also ([Matt. 21:33](/matt#Matt.21.33)) our Lord compares his Church to a vineyard which “a certain householder planted, and hedged round about,” etc.

The stones in this part of the wall are of great size, and were placed, as is generally believed, in the position in which they are now found in the time of Solomon. “The congregation at the wailing-place is one of the most solemn gatherings left to the Jewish Church, and as the writer gazed at the motley concourse he experienced a feeling of sorrow that the remnants of the chosen race should be heartlessly thrust outside the sacred enclosure of their fathers’ holy temple by men of an alien race and an alien creed. Many of the elders, seated on the ground, with their backs against the wall, on the west side of the area, and with their faces turned toward the eternal house, read out of their well-thumbed Hebrew books passages from the prophetic writings, such as [Isa. 64:9-12](/isa#Isa.64.9)“ (King’s Recent Discoveries, etc.).

Now the measure of the iniquity of the Canaanites was full, and Israel was employed by God to sweep them away from off the face of the earth. In entering on this new stage of the war, the tribe of Judah, according to divine direction, took the lead.

 In the days of Saul and David the people of Israel engaged in many wars with the nations around, and after the division of the kingdom into two they often warred with each other. They had to defend themselves also against the inroads of the Egyptians, the Assyrians, and the Babylonians. The whole history of Israel from first to last presents but few periods of peace.

The wilderness region in the Sinaitic peninsula through which for forty years the Hebrews wandered is generally styled “the wilderness of the wanderings.” This entire region is in the form of a triangle, having its base toward the north and its apex toward the south. Its extent from north to south is about 250 miles, and at its widest point it is about 150 miles broad. Throughout this vast region of some 1,500 square miles there is not a single river. The northern part of this triangular peninsula is properly the “wilderness of the wanderings” (et-Tih).

The priests, too, were forbidden the use of wine and strong drink when engaged in their sacred functions ([Lev. 10:1](/lev#Lev.10.1), [9](/lev#Lev.10.9)-11). “Wine is little used now in the East, from the fact that Mohammedans are not allowed to taste it, and very few of other creeds touch it. When it is drunk, water is generally mixed with it, and this was the custom in the days of Christ also. The people indeed are everywhere very sober in hot climates; a drunken person, in fact, is never seen”, (Geikie’s Life of Christ). The sin of drunkenness, however, must have been not uncommon in the olden times, for it is mentioned either metaphorically or literally more than seventy times in the Bible.

 A drink-offering of wine was presented with the daily sacrifice ([Ex. 29:40](/exod#Exod.29.40), [41](/exod#Exod.29.41)), and also with the offering of the first-fruits ([Lev. 23:13](/lev#Lev.23.13)), and with various other sacrifices ([Num. 15:5](/num#Num.15.5), [7](/num#Num.15.7), [10](/num#Num.15.10)).

They say if men are not saved by works, then works are not necessary. If the most moral of men are saved in the same way as the very chief of sinners, then good works are of no moment. And more than this, if the grace of God is most clearly displayed in the salvation of the vilest of men, then the worse men are the better.

 The objection has no validity. The gospel of salvation by grace shows that good works are necessary. It is true, unchangeably true, that without holiness no man shall see the Lord. “Neither adulterers, nor thieves, nor covetous, nor drunkards” shall inherit the kingdom of God.

 Works are “good” only when, (1) they spring from the principle of love to God. The moral character of an act is determined by the moral principle that prompts it. Faith and love in the heart are the essential elements of all true obedience. Hence good works only spring from a believing heart, can only be wrought by one reconciled to God ([Eph. 2:10](/eph#Eph.2.10); [James 2:18](/jas#Jas.2.18):22).",0.0,unmatched,unmatched,,

Tola’im in some places denotes the caterpillar ([Deut. 28:39](/deut#Deut.28.39); [Jonah 4:7](/jonah#Jonah.4.7)), and rimmah, the larvae, as bred from putridity ([Job 17:14](/job#Job.17.14); [21:26](/job#Job.21.26); [24:20](/job#Job.24.20)).

Writing,6299,w-p111.3,Writing,"The art of writing must have been known in the time of the early Pharaohs. Moses is commanded “to write for a memorial in a book” ([Ex. 17:14](/exod#Exod.17.14)) a record of the attack of Amalek. Frequent mention is afterwards made of writing (28:11, 21, 29, 36; 31:18; 32:15, 16; 34:1, 28; 39:6, 14, 30). The origin of this art is unknown, but there is reason to conclude that in the age of Moses it was well known. The inspired books of Moses are the most ancient extant writings, although there are written monuments as old as about B.C. 2000. The words expressive of “writing,” “book,” and “ink,” are common to all the branches or dialects of the Semitic language, and hence it has been concluded that this art must have been known to the earliest Semites before they separated into their various tribes, and nations, and families.

 “The Old Testament and the discoveries of Oriental archaeology alike tell us that the age of the Exodus was throughout the world of Western Asia an age of literature and books, of readers and writers, and that the cities of Palestine were stored with the contemporaneous records of past events inscribed on imperishable clay. They further tell us that the kinsfolk and neighbours of the Israelites were already acquainted with alphabetic writing, that the wanderers in the desert and the tribes of Edom were in contact with the cultured scribes and traders of Ma’in [Southern Arabia], and that the ‘house of bondage’ from which Israel had escaped was a land where the art of writing was blazoned not only on the temples of the gods, but also on the dwellings of the rich and powerful.”, Sayce.

 The “Book of the Dead” was a collection of prayers and formulae, by the use of which the souls of the dead were supposed to attain to rest and peace in the next world. It was composed at various periods from the earliest time to the Persian conquest. It affords an interesting glimpse into the religious life and system of belief among the ancient Egyptians. We learn from it that they believed in the existence of one Supreme Being, the immortality of the soul, judgement after death, and the resurrection of the body. It shows, too, a high state of literary activity in Egypt in the time of Moses. It refers to extensive libraries then existing. That of Ramessium, in Thebes, e.g., built by Rameses II., contained 20,000 books.

 When the Hebrews entered Canaan it is evident that the art of writing was known to the original inhabitants, as appears, e.g., from the name of the city Debir having been at first Kirjath-sepher, i.e., the “city of the book,” or the “book town” ([Josh. 10:38](/josh#Josh.10.38); [15:15](/josh#Josh.15.15); [Judg. 1:11](/judg#Judg.1.11)).

When our Lord reached the spot he looked up to the publican among the branches, and addressing him by name, told him to make haste and come down, as he intended that day to abide at his house.

Only four of these courses or “families” of the priests returned from the Exile ([Ezra 2:36-39](/ezra#Ezra.2.36)); but they were then re-distributed under the old designations. The priests served at the temple twice each year, and only for a week each time. Zacharias’s time had come for this service. During this period his home would be one of the chambers set apart for the priests on the sides of the temple ground. The offering of incense was one of the most solemn parts of the daily worship of the temple, and lots were drawn each day to determine who should have this great honour, an honour which no priest could enjoy more than once during his lifetime.

 While Zacharias ministered at the golden altar of incense in the holy place, it was announced to him by the angel Gabriel that his wife Elisabeth, who was also of a priestly family, now stricken in years, would give birth to a son who was to be called John, and that he would be the forerunner of the long-expected Messiah ([Luke 1:12-17](/luke#Luke.1.12)). As a punishment for his refusing to believe this message, he was struck dumb and “not able to speak until the day that these things should be performed” (20). Nine months passed away, and Elisabeth’s child was born, and when in answer to their inquiry Zacharias wrote on a “writing tablet,” “His name is John,” his mouth was opened, and he praised God (60-79).

It was one of the tribes which did not drive out the Canaanites, but only made them tributary ([Judg. 1:30](/judg#Judg.1.30)). It took little interest in public affairs. It responded, however, readily to the summons of Gideon (6:35), and afterwards assisted in enthroning David at Hebron ([1 Chr. 12:33](/1chr#1Chr.12.33), [40](/1chr#1Chr.12.40)).

 In Deborah’s song the words, “Out of Zebulun they that handle the pen of the writer” ([Judg. 5:14](/judg#Judg.5.14)) has been rendered in the R.V., “They that handle the marshal’s staff.” This is a questionable rendering. “The word sopher (‘scribe’ or ’writer’) defines the word shebhet (‘rod’ or ‘pen’) with which it is conjoined. The ‘rod of the scribe’ on the Assyrian monuments was the stylus of wood or metal, with the help of which the clay tablet was engraved, or the papyrus inscribed with characters. The scribe who wielded it was the associate and assistant of the ‘lawgivers.’” (Sayce).",0.0,person,zebulun_3002,,

Zechariah 1,6394,z-p76.2,Zechariah,"A prophet of Judah, the eleventh of the twelve minor prophets. Like Ezekiel, he was of priestly extraction. He describes himself (1:1) as “the son of Berechiah.” In [Ezra 5:1](/ezra#Ezra.5.1) and 6:14 he is called “the son of Iddo,” who was properly his grandfather. His prophetical career began in the second year of Darius (B.C. 520), about sixteen years after the return of the first company from exile. He was contemporary with Haggai ([Ezra 5:1](/ezra#Ezra.5.1)).

 His book consists of two distinct parts, (1) chapters 1 to 8, inclusive, and (2) 9 to the end. It begins with a preface (1:1-6), which recalls the nation’s past history, for the purpose of presenting a solemn warning to the present generation. Then follows a series of eight visions (1:7-6:8), succeeding one another in one night, which may be regarded as a symbolical history of Israel, intended to furnish consolation to the returned exiles and stir up hope in their minds. The symbolical action, the crowning of Joshua (6:9-15), describes how the kingdoms of the world become the kingdom of God’s Christ.

 Chapters 7 and 8, delivered two years later, are an answer to the question whether the days of mourning for the destruction of the city should be any longer kept, and an encouraging address to the people, assuring them of God’s presence and blessing.

 The second part of the book (ch. 9-14) bears no date. It is probable that a considerable interval separates it from the first part. It consists of two burdens.

 The first burden (ch. 9-11) gives an outline of the course of God’s providential dealings with his people down to the time of the Advent.

 The second burden (ch. 12-14) points out the glories that await Israel in “the latter day”, the final conflict and triumph of God’s kingdom.",1.0,person,zechariah_3016,zechariah_3016,

Zedekiah 1,6417,z-p104.3,Zedekiah,"The last king of Judah. He was the third son of Josiah, and his mother’s name was Hamutal, the daughter of Jeremiah of Libnah, and hence he was the brother of Jehoahaz ([2 Kings 23:31](/2kgs#2Kgs.23.31); [24:17](/2kgs#2Kgs.24.17), [18](/2kgs#2Kgs.24.18)). His original name was Mattaniah; but when Nebuchadnezzar placed him on the throne as the successor to Jehoiachin he changed his name to Zedekiah. The prophet Jeremiah was his counsellor, yet “he did evil in the sight of the Lord” ([2 Kings 24:19](/2kgs#2Kgs.24.19), [20](/2kgs#2Kgs.24.20); [Jer. 52:2](/jer#Jer.52.2), [3](/jer#Jer.52.3)). He ascended the throne at the age of twenty-one years. The kingdom was at that time tributary to Nebuchadnezzar; but, despite the strong remonstrances of Jeremiah and others, as well as the example of Jehoiachin, he threw off the yoke of Babylon, and entered into an alliance with Hophra, king of Egypt. This brought up Nebuchadnezzar, “with all his host” ([2 King 25:1](/2kgs#2Kgs.25.1)), against Jerusalem. During this siege, which lasted about eighteen months, “every worst woe befell the devoted city, which drank the cup of God’s fury to the dregs” ([2 Kings 25:3](/2kgs#2Kgs.25.3); [Lam. 4:4](/lam#Lam.4.4), [5](/lam#Lam.4.5), [10](/lam#Lam.4.10)). The city was plundered and laid in ruins. Zedekiah and his followers, attempting to escape, were made captive and taken to Riblah. There, after seeing his own children put to death, his own eyes were put out, and, being loaded with chains, he was carried captive (B.C. 588) to Babylon ([2 Kings 25:1-7](/2kgs#2Kgs.25.1); [2 Chr. 36:12](/2chr#2Chr.36.12); [Jer. 32:4](/jer#Jer.32.4), [5](/jer#Jer.32.5); 34:2, 3; 39:1-7; 52:4-11; [Ezek. 12:12](/ezek#Ezek.12.12)), where he remained a prisoner, how long is unknown, to the day of his death.

 After the fall of Jerusalem, Nebuzaraddan was sent to carry out its complete destruction. The city was razed to the ground. Only a small number of vinedressers and husbandmen were permitted to remain in the land ([Jer. 52:16](/jer#Jer.52.16)).

Zidon,6464,z-p153.2,Zidon,"A fishery, a town on the Mediterranean coast, about 25 miles north of Tyre. It received its name from the “first-born” of Canaan, the grandson of Noah ([Gen. 10:15](/gen#Gen.10.15), [19](/gen#Gen.10.19)). It was the first home of the Phoenicians on the coast of Palestine, and from its extensive commercial relations became a “great” city ([Josh. 11:8](/josh#Josh.11.8); [19:28](/josh#Josh.19.28)). It was the mother city of Tyre. It lay within the lot of the tribe of Asher, but was never subdued ([Judg. 1:31](/judg#Judg.1.31)). The Zidonians long oppressed Israel ([Judg. 10:12](/judg#Judg.10.12)). From the time of David its glory began to wane, and Tyre, its “virgin daughter” ([Isa. 23:12](/isa#Isa.23.12)), rose to its place of pre-eminence. Solomon entered into a matrimonial alliance with the Zidonians, and thus their form of idolatrous worship found a place in the land of Israel ([1 Kings 11:1](/1kgs#1Kgs.11.1), [33](/1kgs#1Kgs.11.33)). This city was famous for its manufactures and arts, as well as for its commerce ([1 Kings 5:6](/1kgs#1Kgs.5.6); [1 Chr. 22:4](/1chr#1Chr.22.4); [Ezek. 27:8](/ezek#Ezek.27.8)). It is frequently referred to by the prophets ([Isa. 23:2](/isa#Isa.23.2), [4](/isa#Isa.23.4), [12](/isa#Isa.23.12); [Jer. 25:22](/jer#Jer.25.22); [27:3](/jer#Jer.27.3); [47:4](/jer#Jer.47.4); [Ezek. 27:8](/ezek#Ezek.27.8); [28:21](/ezek#Ezek.28.21), [22](/ezek#Ezek.28.22); [32:30](/ezek#Ezek.32.30); [Joel 3:4](/joel#Joel.3.4)). Our Lord visited the “coasts” of Tyre and Zidon = Sidon (q.v.), [Matt. 15:21](/matt#Matt.15.21); [Mark 7:24](/mark#Mark.7.24); [Luke 4:26](/luke#Luke.4.26); and from this region many came forth to hear him preaching ([Mark 3:8](/mark#Mark.3.8); [Luke 6:17](/luke#Luke.6.17)). From Sidon, at which the ship put in after leaving Caesarea, Paul finally sailed for Rome ([Acts 27:3](/acts#Acts.27.3), [4](/acts#Acts.27.4)).

 This city is now a town of 10,000 inhabitants, with remains of walls built in the twelfth century A.D. In 1855, the sarcophagus of Eshmanezer was discovered. From a Phoenician inscription on its lid, it appears that he was a “king of the Sidonians,” probably in the third century B.C., and that his mother was a priestess of Ashtoreth, “the goddess of the Sidonians.” In this inscription Baal is mentioned as the chief god of the Sidonians.",0.0,multi,"['sidon_1093', 'sidon_494', 'sidon_1094', 'zidon_2738']",zidon_2738,sidon_1093

Achish, the king, assigned him Ziklag as his place of residence. There he dwelt for over a year and four months. From this time it pertained to the kings of Judah ([1 Sam. 27:6](/1sam#1Sam.27.6)). During his absence with his army to join the Philistine expedition against the Israelites (29:11), it was destroyed by the Amalekites (30:1, 2), whom David, however, pursued and utterly routed, returning all the captives ([1 Sam. 30:26-31](/1sam#1Sam.30.26)). Two days after his return from this expedition, David received tidings of the disastrous battle of Gilboa and of the death of Saul ([2 Sam. 1:1-16](/2sam#2Sam.1.1)). He now left Ziklag and returned to Hebron, along with his two wives, Ahinoam and Abigail, and his band of 600 men. It has been identified with ‘Asluj, a heap of ruins south of Beersheba.
