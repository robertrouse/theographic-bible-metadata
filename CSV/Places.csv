He was put to death by his brother Cain ([Gen. 4:1-16](/gen#Gen.4.1)). Guided by the instruction of their father, the two brothers were trained in the duty of worshipping God. “And in process of time” (marg. “at the end of days”, i.e., on the Sabbath) each of them offered up to God of the first-fruits of his labours. Cain, as a husbandman, offered the fruits of the field; Abel, as a shepherd, of the firstlings of his flock. “The Lord had respect unto Abel and his offering; but unto Cain and his offering he had not respect” ([Gen. 4:3-5](/gen#Gen.4.3)). On this account Cain was angry with his brother, and formed the design of putting him to death; a design which he at length found an opportunity of carrying into effect ([Gen. 4:8](/gen#Gen.4.8), [9](/gen#Gen.4.9). Comp. [1 John 3:12](/1john#1John.3.12)). There are several references to Abel in the New Testament. Our Saviour speaks of him as “righteous” ([Matt. 23:35](/matt#Matt.23.35)). “The blood of sprinkling” is said to speak “better things than that of Abel” ([Heb. 12:24](/heb#Heb.12.24)); i.e., the blood of Jesus is the reality of which the blood of the offering made by Abel was only the type. The comparison here is between the sacrifice offered by Christ and that offered by Abel, and not between the blood of Christ calling for mercy and the blood of the murdered Abel calling for vengeance, as has sometimes been supposed. It is also said ([Heb. 11:4](/heb#Heb.11.4)) that “Abel offered unto God a more excellent sacrifice than Cain.” This sacrifice was made “by faith;” this faith rested in God, not only as the Creator and the God of providence, but especially in God as the great Redeemer, whose sacrifice was typified by the sacrifices which, no doubt by the divine institution, were offered from the days of Adam downward. On account of that “faith” which looked forward to the great atoning sacrifice, Abel’s offering was accepted of God. Cain’s offering had no such reference, and therefore was rejected. Abel was the first martyr, as he was the first of our race to die.

 Abel (Heb. ‘abhel), lamentation ([1 Sam. 6:18](/1sam#1Sam.6.18)), the name given to the great stone in Joshua’s field whereon the ark was “set down.” The Revised Version, however, following the Targum and the LXX., reads in the Hebrew text ’ebhen (= a stone), and accordingly translates “unto the great stone, whereon they set down the ark.” This reading is to be preferred.

It has been identified with the mounds of Akker Kuf, some 50 miles to the north of Babylon; but this is doubtful. It was one of the cities of Nimrod’s kingdom ([Ge 10:10](/gen#Gen.10.10)). It stood close to the Euphrates, opposite Sippara.

 It is also the name of the country of which this city was the capital, namely, northern or upper Babylonia. The Accadians who came from the “mountains of the east,” where the ark rested, attained to a high degree of civilization. In the Babylonian inscriptions they are called “the black heads” and “the black faces,” in contrast to “the white race” of Semitic descent. They invented the form of writing in pictorial hieroglyphics, and also the cuneiform system, in which they wrote many books partly on papyrus and partly on clay. The Semitic Babylonians (“the white race”), or, as some scholars think, first the Cushites, and afterwards, as a second immigration, the Semites, invaded and conquered this country; and then the Accadian language ceased to be a spoken language, although for the sake of its literary treasures it continued to be studied by the educated classes of Babylonia. A large portion of the Ninevite tablets brought to light by Oriental research consists of interlinear or parallel translations from Accadian into Assyrian; and thus that long-forgotten language has been recovered by scholars. It belongs to the class of languages called agglutinative, common to the Tauranian race; i.e., it consists of words “glued together,” without declension of conjugation. These tablets in a remarkable manner illustrate ancient history. Among other notable records, they contain an account of the Creation which closely resembles that given in the book of Genesis, of the Sabbath as a day of rest, and of the Deluge and its cause.",,,,,,UNVERIFIED,,,6aa30252-b8b6-47e4-8e02-d2e3a8d182c6,,,,nimrod_2206,33.09201654,44.12924815,A,accad_14

From the very beginning ([Deut. 2:16-20](/deut#Deut.2.16)) of their history till they are lost sight of ([Judg. 5:2](/judg#Judg.5.2)), this tribe is closely associated with the Moabites ([Judg. 10:11](/judg#Judg.10.11); [2 Chr. 20:1](/2chr#2Chr.20.1); [Zeph. 2:8](/zeph#Zeph.2.8)). Both of these tribes hired Balaam to curse Israel ([Deut. 23:4](/deut#Deut.23.4)). The Ammonites were probably more of a predatory tribe, moving from place to place, while the Moabites were more settled. They inhabited the country east of the Jordan and north of Moab and the Dead Sea, from which they had expelled the Zamzummims or Zuzims ([Deut. 2:20](/deut#Deut.2.20); [Gen. 14:5](/gen#Gen.14.5)). They are known as the Beni-ammi ([Gen. 19:38](/gen#Gen.19.38)), Ammi or Ammon being worshipped as their chief god. They were of Semitic origin, and closely related to the Hebrews in blood and language. They showed no kindness to the Israelites when passing through their territory, and therefore they were prohibited from “entering the congregation of the Lord to the tenth generation” ([Deut. 23:3](/deut#Deut.23.3)). They afterwards became hostile to Israel ([Judg. 3:13](/judg#Judg.3.13)). Jephthah waged war against them, and “took twenty cities with a very great slaughter” ([Judg. 11:33](/judg#Judg.11.33)). They were again signally defeated by Saul ([1 Sam. 11:11](/1sam#1Sam.11.11)). David also defeated them and their allies the Syrians ([2 Sam. 10:6-14](/2sam#2Sam.10.6)), and took their chief city, Rabbah, with much spoil ([2 Sam. 10:14](/2sam#2Sam.10.14); [12:26-31](/2sam#2Sam.12.26)). The subsequent events of their history are noted in [2 Chr. 20:25](/2chr#2Chr.20.25); [26:8](/2chr#2Chr.26.8); [Jer. 49:1](/jer#Jer.49.1); [Ezek. 25:3](/ezek#Ezek.25.3), [6](/ezek#Ezek.25.6). One of Solomon’s wives was Naamah, an Ammonite. She was the mother of Rehoboam ([1 Kings 14:31](/1kgs#1Kgs.14.31); [2 Chr. 12:13](/2chr#2Chr.12.13)).

 The prophets predicted fearful judgments against the Ammonites because of their hostility to Israel ([Zeph. 2:8](/zeph#Zeph.2.8); [Jer. 49:1-6](/jer#Jer.49.1); [Ezek. 25:1-5](/ezek#Ezek.25.1), [10](/ezek#Ezek.25.10); [Amos 1:13-15](/amos#Amos.1.13)).

 The national idol worshipped by this people was Molech or Milcom, at whose altar they offered human sacrifices ([1 Kings 11:5](/1kgs#1Kgs.11.5), [7](/1kgs#1Kgs.11.7)). The high places built for this idol by Solomon, at the instigation of his Ammonitish wives, were not destroyed till the time of Josiah ([2 Kings 23:13](/2kgs#2Kgs.23.13)).",http://sws.geonames.org/250441,31.95522,35.94503,,,VERIFIED,,Amman,346e9ae9-acec-4f8e-8c1e-5640157ed5ca,,,,,31.95522,35.94503,A,ammon_58

It comprehended all the north-west portion of the country, and is much better known to travellers than any other portion. This country is, however, divided by modern geographers into (1) Arabia Proper, or the Arabian Peninsula; (2) Northern Arabia, or the Arabian Desert; and (3) Western Arabia, which includes the peninsula of Sinai and the Desert of Petra, originally inhabited by the Horites ([Gen. 14:6](/gen#Gen.14.6), etc.), but in later times by the descendants of Esau, and known as the Land of Edom or Idumea, also as the Desert of Seir or Mount Seir.

 The whole land appears ([Gen. 10](/gen#Gen.10)) to have been inhabited by a variety of tribes of different lineage, Ishmaelites, Arabians, Idumeans, Horites, and Edomites; but at length becoming amalgamated, they came to be known by the general designation of Arabs. The modern nation of Arabs is predominantly Ishmaelite. Their language is the most developed and the richest of all the Semitic languages, and is of great value to the student of Hebrew.

 The Israelites wandered for forty years in Arabia. In the days of Solomon, and subsequently, commercial intercourse was to a considerable extent kept up with this country ([1 Kings 10:15](/1kgs#1Kgs.10.15); [2 Chr. 9:14](/2chr#2Chr.9.14); [17:11](/2chr#2Chr.17.11)). Arabians were present in Jerusalem at Pentecost ([Acts 2:11](/acts#Acts.2.11)). Paul retired for a season into Arabia after his conversion ([Gal. 1:17](/gal#Gal.1.17)). This country is frequently referred to by the prophets ([Isa. 21:11](/isa#Isa.21.11); [42:11](/isa#Isa.42.11); [Jer. 25:24](/jer#Jer.25.24), etc.)",,,,,,NOT_IDENTIFIABLE,,,e059bdd0-dc40-41df-bf8b-832442f20334,,,,,27.4,37.7,A,arabia_80

Three thousand feet of the summit of the higher of these peaks is covered with perpetual snow. It is called Kuh-i-nuh, i.e., “Noah’s mountain”, by the Persians. This part of Armenia was inhabited by a people who spoke a language unlike any other now known, though it may have been related to the modern Georgian. About B.C. 900 they borrowed the cuneiform characters of Nineveh, and from this time we have inscriptions of a line of kings who at times contended with Assyria.

It was a mountainous region lying to the north of Babylonia, extending along the Tigris as far as to the high mountain range of Armenia, the Gordiaean or Carduchian mountains. It was founded in B.C. 1700 under Bel-kap-kapu, and became an independent and a conquering power, and shook off the yoke of its Babylonian masters. It subdued the whole of Northern Asia. The Assyrians were Semites ([Gen. 10:22](/gen#Gen.10.22)), but in process of time non-Semite tribes mingled with the inhabitants. They were a military people, the “Romans of the East.”

 Of the early history of the kingdom of Assyria little is positively known. In B.C. 1120 Tiglath-pileser I., the greatest of the Assyrian kings, “crossed the Euphrates, defeated the kings of the Hittites, captured the city of Carchemish, and advanced as far as the shores of the Mediterranean.” He may be regarded as the founder of the first Assyrian empire. After this the Assyrians gradually extended their power, subjugating the states of Northern Syria. In the reign of Ahab, king of Israel, Shalmaneser II. marched an army against the Syrian states, whose allied army he encountered and vanquished at Karkar. This led to Ahab’s casting off the yoke of Damascus and allying himself with Judah. Some years after this the Assyrian king marched an army against Hazael, king of Damascus. He besieged and took that city. He also brought under tribute Jehu, and the cities of Tyre and Sidon.

 About a hundred years after this (B.C. 745) the crown was seized by a military adventurer called Pul, who assumed the name of Tiglath-pileser III. He directed his armies into Syria, which had by this time regained its independence, and took (B.C. 740) Arpad, near Aleppo, after a siege of three years, and reduced Hamath. Azariah (Uzziah) was an ally of the king of Hamath, and thus was compelled by Tiglath-pileser to do him homage and pay a yearly tribute.

 In B.C. 738, in the reign of Menahem, king of Israel, Pul invaded Israel, and imposed on it a heavy tribute ([2 Kings 15:19](/2kgs#2Kgs.15.19)). Ahaz, the king of Judah, when engaged in a war against Israel and Syria, appealed for help to this Assyrian king by means of a present of gold and silver ([2 Kings 16:8](/2kgs#2Kgs.16.8)); who accordingly “marched against Damascus, defeated and put Rezin to death, and besieged the city itself.” Leaving a portion of his army to continue the siege, “he advanced through the province east of Jordan, spreading fire and sword,” and became master of Philistia, and took Samaria and Damascus. He died B.C. 727, and was succeeded by Shalmanezer IV., who ruled till B.C. 722. He also invaded Syria ([2 Kings 17:5](/2kgs#2Kgs.17.5)), but was deposed in favour of Sargon (q.v.) the Tartan, or commander-in-chief of the army, who took Samaria (q.v.) after a siege of three years, and so put an end to the kingdom of Israel, carrying the people away into captivity, B.C. 722 ([2 Kings 17:1-6](/2kgs#2Kgs.17.1), [24](/2kgs#2Kgs.17.24); [18:7](/2kgs#2Kgs.18.7), [9](/2kgs#2Kgs.18.9)). He also overran the land of Judah, and took the city of Jerusalem ([Isa. 10:6](/isa#Isa.10.6), [12](/isa#Isa.10.12), [22](/isa#Isa.10.22), [24](/isa#Isa.10.24), [34](/isa#Isa.10.34)). Mention is next made of Sennacherib (B.C. 705), the son and successor of Sargon ([2 Kings 18:13](/2kgs#2Kgs.18.13); [19:37](/2kgs#2Kgs.19.37); [Isa. 7:17](/isa#Isa.7.17), [18](/isa#Isa.7.18)); and then of Esar-haddon, his son and successor, who took Manasseh, king of Judah, captive, and kept him for some time a prisoner at Babylon, which he alone of all the Assyrian kings made the seat of his government ([2 Kings 19:37](/2kgs#2Kgs.19.37); [Isa. 37:38](/isa#Isa.37.38)).

 Assur-bani-pal, the son of Esarhaddon, became king, and in [Ezra 4:10](/ezra#Ezra.4.10) is referred to as Asnapper. From an early period Assyria had entered on a conquering career, and having absorbed Babylon, the kingdoms of Hamath, Damascus, and Samaria, it conquered Phoenicia, and made Judea feudatory, and subjected Philistia and Idumea. At length, however, its power declined. In B.C. 727 the Babylonians threw off the rule of the Assyrians, under the leadership of the powerful Chaldean prince Merodach-baladan ([2 Kings 20:12](/2kgs#2Kgs.20.12)), who, after twelve years, was subdued by Sargon, who now reunited the kingdom, and ruled over a vast empire. But on his death the smouldering flames of rebellion again burst forth, and the Babylonians and Medes successfully asserted their independence (B.C. 625), and Assyria fell according to the prophecies of Isaiah (10:5-19), Nahum (3:19), and Zephaniah (3:13), and the many separate kingdoms of which it was composed ceased to recognize the “great king” ([2 Kings 18:19](/2kgs#2Kgs.18.19); [Isa. 36:4](/isa#Isa.36.4)). Ezekiel (31) attests (about B.C. 586) how completely Assyria was overthrown.

This word has given rise to many different views. Some Jewish interpreters regard it as the name of a place some 12 miles east of Jerusalem, in the wilderness. Others take it to be the name of an evil spirit, or even of Satan. But when we remember that the two goats together form a type of Christ, on whom the Lord “laid the iniquity of us all,” and examine into the root meaning of this word (viz., “separation”), the interpretation of those who regard the one goat as representing the atonement made, and the other, that “for Azazel,” as representing the effect of the great work of atonement (viz., the complete removal of sin), is certainly to be preferred. The one goat which was “for Jehovah” was offered as a sin-offering, by which atonement was made. But the sins must also be visibly banished, and therefore they were symbolically laid by confession on the other goat, which was then “sent away for Azazel” into the wilderness. The form of this word indicates intensity, and therefore signifies the total separation of sin: it was wholly carried away. It was important that the result of the sacrifices offered by the high priest alone in the sanctuary should be embodied in a visible transaction, and hence the dismissal of the “scape-goat.” It was of no consequence what became of it, as the whole import of the transaction lay in its being sent into the wilderness bearing away sin. As the goat “for Jehovah” was to witness to the demerit of sin and the need of the blood of atonement, so the goat “for Azazel” was to witness to the efficacy of the sacrifice and the result of the shedding of blood in the taking away of sin.",,,,,,UNVERIFIED,,,82f5a884-b972-4164-81c6-d23f51a8f90d,,,,,,,A,azazel_127

Their object in building this tower was probably that it might be seen as a rallying-point in the extensive plain of Shinar, to which they had emigrated from the uplands of Armenia, and so prevent their being scattered abroad. But God interposed and defeated their design by condounding their language, and hence the name Babel, meaning “confusion.” In the Babylonian tablets there is an account of this event, and also of the creation and the deluge.

 The Temple of Belus, which is supposed to occupy its site, is described by the Greek historian Herodotus as a temple of great extent and magnificence, erected by the Babylonians for their god Belus. The treasures Nebuchadnezzar brought from Jerusalem were laid up in this temple ([2 Chr. 36:7](/2chr#2Chr.36.7)).

 The Birs Nimrud, at ancient Borsippa, about 7 miles south-west of Hillah, the modern town which occupies a part of the site of ancient Babylon, and 6 miles from the Euphrates, is an immense mass of broken and fire-blasted fragments, of about 2,300 feet in circumference, rising suddenly to the height of 235 feet above the desert-plain, and is with probability regarded as the ruins of the tower of Babel.

It stood on the Euphrates, about 200 miles above its junction with the Tigris, which flowed through its midst and divided it into two almost equal parts. The Elamites invaded Chaldea (i.e., Lower Mesopotamia, or Shinar, and Upper Mesopotamia, or Accad, now combined into one) and held it in subjection. At length Khammu-rabi delivered it from the foreign yoke, and founded the new empire of Chaldea (q.v.), making Babylon the capital of the united kingdom. This city gradually grew in extent and grandeur, but in process of time it became subject to Assyria. On the fall of Nineveh (B.C. 606) it threw off the Assyrian yoke, and became the capital of the growing Babylonian empire. Under Nebuchadnezzar it became one of the most splendid cities of the ancient world.

 After passing through various vicissitudes the city was occupied by Cyrus, “king of Elam,” B.C. 538, who issued a decree permitting the Jews to return to their own land ([Ezra 1](/ezra#Ezra.1)). It then ceased to be the capital of an empire. It was again and again visited by hostile armies, till its inhabitants were all driven from their homes, and the city became a complete desolation, its very site being forgotten from among men.

 On the west bank of the Euphrates, about 50 miles south of Bagdad, there is found a series of artificial mounds of vast extent. These are the ruins of this once famous proud city. These ruins are principally (1) the great mound called Babil by the Arabs. This was probably the noted Temple of Belus, which was a pyramid about 480 feet high. (2) The Kasr (i.e., “the palace”). This was the great palace of Nebuchadnezzar. It is almost a square, each side of which is about 700 feet long. The little town of Hillah, near the site of Babylon, is built almost wholly of bricks taken from this single mound. (3) A lofty mound, on the summit of which stands a modern tomb called Amran ibn-Ali. This is probably the most ancient portion of the remains of the city, and represents the ruins of the famous hanging-gardens, or perhaps of some royal palace. The utter desolation of the city once called “The glory of kingdoms” ([Isa. 13:19](/isa#Isa.13.19)) was foretold by the prophets ([Isa. 13:4-22](/isa#Isa.13.4); [Jer. 25:12](/jer#Jer.25.12); [50:2](/jer#Jer.50.2), [3](/jer#Jer.50.3); [Dan. 2:31-38](/dan#Dan.2.31)).

 The Babylon mentioned in [1 Pet. 5:13](/1pet#1Pet.5.13) was not Rome, as some have thought, but the literal city of Babylon, which was inhabited by many Jews at the time Peter wrote.

 In [Rev. 14:8](/rev#Rev.14.8); [16:19](/rev#Rev.16.19); [17:5](/rev#Rev.17.5); and 18:2, “Babylon” is supposed to mean Rome, not considered as pagan, but as the prolongation of the ancient power in the papal form. Rome, pagan and papal, is regarded as one power. “The literal Babylon was the beginner and supporter of tyranny and idolatry...This city and its whole empire were taken by the Persians under Cyrus; the Persians were subdued by the Macedonians, and the Macedonians by the Romans; so that Rome succeeded to the power of old Babylon. And it was her method to adopt the worship of the false deities she had conquered; so that by her own act she became the heiress and successor of all the Babylonian idolatry, and of all that was introduced into it by the immediate successors of Babylon, and consequently of all the idolatry of the earth.” Rome, or “mystical Babylon,” is “that great city which reigneth over the kings of the earth” (17:18).",http://dare.ht.lu.se/places/22328,32.53617,44.42082,,"jehoiachin_791,zedekiah_1950",VERIFIED,"settlement,urban","Babylon|Babylon, Babylon",076e0ef4-a410-4562-a804-a6560033650f,,,,,32.53617,44.42082,B,babylon_151

This country extended from Gilead in the south to Hermon in the north, and from the Jordan on the west to Salcah on the east. Along with the half of Gilead it was given to the half-tribe of Manasseh ([Josh. 13:29-31](/josh#Josh.13.29)). Golan, one of its cities, became a “city of refuge” ([Josh. 21:27](/josh#Josh.21.27)).

It was originally the royal Canaanite city of Luz ([Gen. 28:19](/gen#Gen.28.19)). The name Bethel was at first apparently given to the sanctuary in the neighbourhood of Luz, and was not given to the city itself till after its conquest by the tribe of Ephraim. When Abram entered Canaan he formed his second encampment between Bethel and Hai ([Gen. 12:8](/gen#Gen.12.8)); and on his return from Egypt he came back to it, and again “called upon the name of the Lord” (13:4). Here Jacob, on his way from Beersheba to Haran, had a vision of the angels of God ascending and descending on the ladder whose top reached unto heaven (28:10, 19); and on his return he again visited this place, “where God talked with him” (35:1-15), and there he “built an altar, and called the place El-beth-el” (q.v.). To this second occasion of God’s speaking with Jacob at Bethel, Hosea (12:4, 5) makes reference.

 In troublous times the people went to Bethel to ask counsel of God ([Judg. 20:18](/judg#Judg.20.18), [31](/judg#Judg.20.31); 21:2). Here the ark of the covenant was kept for a long time under the care of Phinehas, the grandson of Aaron (20:26-28). Here also Samuel held in rotation his court of justice ([1 Sam. 7:16](/1sam#1Sam.7.16)). It was included in Israel after the kingdom was divided, and it became one of the seats of the worship of the golden calf ([1 Kings 12:28-33](/1kgs#1Kgs.12.28); [13:1](/1kgs#1Kgs.13.1)). Hence the prophet Hosea ([Hos. 4:15](/hos#Hos.4.15); [5:8](/hos#Hos.5.8); [10:5](/hos#Hos.10.5), [8](/hos#Hos.10.8)) calls it in contempt Beth-aven, i.e., “house of idols.” Bethel remained an abode of priests even after the kingdom of Israel was desolated by the king of Assyria ([2 Kings 17:28](/2kgs#2Kgs.17.28), [29](/2kgs#2Kgs.17.29)). At length all traces of the idolatries were extirpated by Josiah, king of Judah ([2 Kings 23:15-18](/2kgs#2Kgs.23.15)); and the place was still in existence after the Captivity ([Ezra 2:28](/ezra#Ezra.2.28); [Neh. 7:32](/neh#Neh.7.32)).

But quite recently Schick has discovered a large tank, as sketched here, situated about 100 feet north-west of St. Anne’s Church, which is, as he contends, very probably the Pool of Bethesda.

It is first noticed in Scripture as the place where Rachel died and was buried “by the wayside,” directly to the north of the city ([Gen. 48:7](/gen#Gen.48.7)). The valley to the east was the scene of the story of Ruth the Moabitess. There are the fields in which she gleaned, and the path by which she and Naomi returned to the town. Here was David’s birth-place, and here also, in after years, he was anointed as king by Samuel ([1 Sam. 16:4-13](/1sam#1Sam.16.4)); and it was from the well of Bethlehem that three of his heroes brought water for him at the risk of their lives when he was in the cave of Adullam ([2 Sam. 23:13-17](/2sam#2Sam.23.13)). But it was distinguished above every other city as the birth-place of “Him whose goings forth have been of old” ([Matt. 2:6](/matt#Matt.2.6); comp. [Micah 5:2](/mic#Mic.5.2)). Afterwards Herod, “when he saw that he was mocked of the wise men,” sent and slew “all the children that were in Bethlehem, and in all the coasts thereof, from two years old and under” ([Matt. 2:16](/matt#Matt.2.16), [18](/matt#Matt.2.18); [Jer. 31:15](/jer#Jer.31.15)).

 Bethlehem bears the modern name of Beit-Lahm, i.e., “house of flesh.” It is about 5 miles south of Jerusalem, standing at an elevation of about 2,550 feet above the sea, thus 100 feet higher than Jerusalem.

 There is a church still existing, built by Constantine the Great (A.D. 330), called the “Church of the Nativity,” over a grotto or cave called the “holy crypt,” and said to be the “stable” in which Jesus was born.

It was built by Herod the Great (B.C. 10), who named it after Caesar Augustus, hence called Caesarea Sebaste (Gr. Sebastos = “Augustus”), on the site of an old town called “Strato’s Tower.” It was the capital of the Roman province of Judaea, the seat of the governors or procurators, and the headquarters of the Roman troops. It was the great Gentile city of Palestine, with a spacious artificial harbour. It was adorned with many buildings of great splendour, after the manner of the Roman cities of the West. Here Cornelius the centurion was converted through the instrumentality of Peter ([Acts 10:1](/acts#Acts.10.1), [24](/acts#Acts.10.24)), and thus for the first time the door of faith was opened to the Gentiles. Philip the evangelist resided here with his four daughters (21:8). From this place Saul sailed for his native Tarsus when forced to flee from Jerusalem (9:30), and here he landed when returning from his second missionary journey (18:22). He remained as a prisoner here for two years before his voyage to Rome ([Acts 24:27](/acts#Acts.24.27); [25:1](/acts#Acts.25.1), [4](/acts#Acts.25.4), [6](/acts#Acts.25.6), [13](/acts#Acts.25.13)). Here on a “set day,” when games were celebrated in the theatre in honour of the emperor Claudius, Herod Agrippa I. appeared among the people in great pomp, and in the midst of the idolatrous homage paid to him was suddenly smitten by an angel, and carried out a dying man. He was “eaten of worms” (12:19-23), thus perishing by the same loathsome disease as his granfather, Herod the Great.

It is not mentioned in the Old Testament. After our Lord’s expulsion from Nazareth ([Matt. 4:13-16](/matt#Matt.4.13); [Luke 4:16-31](/luke#Luke.4.16)), Capernaum became his “own city.” It was the scene of many acts and incidents of his life ([Matt. 8:5](/matt#Matt.8.5), [14](/matt#Matt.8.14), [15](/matt#Matt.8.15); 9:2-6, 10-17; 15:1-20; [Mark 1:32-34](/mark#Mark.1.32), etc.). The impenitence and unbelief of its inhabitants after the many evidences our Lord gave among them of the truth of his mission, brought down upon them a heavy denunciation of judgement ([Matt. 11:23](/matt#Matt.11.23)).

 It stood on the western shore of the Sea of Galilee. The “land of Gennesaret,” near, if not in, which it was situated, was one of the most prosperous and crowded districts of Palestine. This city lay on the great highway from Damascus to Acco and Tyre. It has been identified with Tell Hum, about two miles south-west of where the Jordan flows into the lake. Here are extensive ruins of walls and foundations, and also the remains of what must have been a beautiful synagogue, which it is conjectured may have been the one built by the centurion ([Luke 7:5](/luke#Luke.7.5)), in which our Lord frequently taught ([John 6:59](/john#John.6.59); [Mark 1:21](/mark#Mark.1.21); [Luke 4:33](/luke#Luke.4.33)). Others have conjectured that the ruins of the city are to be found at Khan Minyeh, some three miles further to the south on the shore of the lake. “If Tell Hum be Capernaum, the remains spoken of are without doubt the ruins of the synagogue built by the Roman centurion, and one of the most sacred places on earth. It was in this building that our Lord gave the well-known discourse in [John 6](/john#John.6); and it was not without a certain strange feeling that on turning over a large block we found the pot of manna engraved on its face, and remembered the words, ‘I am that bread of life: your fathers did eat manna in the wilderness, and are dead.’”, (The Recovery of Jerusalem.)",http://dare.ht.lu.se/places/33337,32.88093,35.57543,,,VERIFIED,settlement,"Kefar Nahum/Kapharnaoum|Kefar Nahum/Kapharnaoum, Tell Hum",4e447d13-8c9f-4d03-b828-b98b83c17b1c,,,,,32.88093,35.57543,C,capernaum_274

 The country so named is a vast plain formed by the deposits of the Euphrates and the Tigris, extending to about 400 miles along the course of these rivers, and about 100 miles in average breadth. “In former days the vast plains of Babylon were nourished by a complicated system of canals and water-courses, which spread over the surface of the country like a network. The wants of a teeming population were supplied by a rich soil, not less bountiful than that on the banks of the Egyptian Nile. Like islands rising from a golden sea of waving corn stood frequent groves of palm-trees and pleasant gardens, affording to the idler or traveller their grateful and highly-valued shade. Crowds of passengers hurried along the dusty roads to and from the busy city. The land was rich in corn and wine.”

 Recent discoveries, more especially in Babylonia, have thrown much light on the history of the Hebrew patriarchs, and have illustrated or confirmed the Biblical narrative in many points. The ancestor of the Hebrew people, Abram, was, we are told, born at “Ur of the Chaldees.” “Chaldees” is a mistranslation of the Hebrew Kasdim, Kasdim being the Old Testament name of the Babylonians, while the Chaldees were a tribe who lived on the shores of the Persian Gulf, and did not become a part of the Babylonian population till the time of Hezekiah. Ur was one of the oldest and most famous of the Babylonian cities. Its site is now called Mugheir, or Mugayyar, on the western bank of the Euphrates, in Southern Babylonia. About a century before the birth of Abram it was ruled by a powerful dynasty of kings. Their conquests extended to Elam on the one side, and to the Lebanon on the other. They were followed by a dynasty of princes whose capital was Babylon, and who seem to have been of South Arabian origin. The founder of the dynasty was Sumu-abi (“Shem is my father”). But soon afterwards Babylonia fell under Elamite dominion. The kings of Babylon were compelled to acknowledge the supremacy of Elam, and a rival kingdom to that of Babylon, and governed by Elamites, sprang up at Larsa, not far from Ur, but on the opposite bank of the river. In the time of Abram the king of Larsa was Eri-Aku, the son of an Elamite prince, and Eri-Aku, as has long been recognized, is the Biblical “Arioch king of Ellasar” ([Gen. 14:1](/gen#Gen.14.1)). The contemporaneous king of Babylon in the north, in the country termed Shinar in Scripture, was Khammu-rabi.",,,,,,NOT_IDENTIFIABLE,,,48a10e7c-bed0-429a-8a7c-7efb80a3a7b9,,,,,30.9620520474569,46.10374195774169,C,chaldea_282

They are first mentioned in connection with the expulsion of our first parents from Eden ([Gen. 3:24](/gen#Gen.3.24)). There is no intimation given of their shape or form. They are next mentioned when Moses was commanded to provide furniture for the tabernacle ([Ex. 25:17-20](/exod#Exod.25.17); [26:1](/exod#Exod.26.1), [31](/exod#Exod.26.31)). God promised to commune with Moses “from between the cherubim” (25:22). This expression was afterwards used to denote the Divine abode and presence ([Num. 7:89](/num#Num.7.89); [1 Sam. 4:4](/1sam#1Sam.4.4); [Isa. 37:16](/isa#Isa.37.16); [Ps. 80:1](/ps#Ps.80.1); [99:1](/ps#Ps.99.1)). In Ezekiel’s vision (10:1-20) they appear as living creatures supporting the throne of God. From Ezekiel’s description of them (1;10; 41:18, 19), they appear to have been compound figures, unlike any real object in nature; artificial images possessing the features and properties of several animals. Two cherubim were placed on the mercy-seat of the ark; two of colossal size overshadowed it in Solomon’s temple. Ezekiel (1:4-14) speaks of four; and this number of “living creatures” is mentioned in [Rev. 4:6](/rev#Rev.4.6). Those on the ark are called the “cherubim of glory” ([Heb. 9:5](/heb#Heb.9.5)), i.e., of the Shechinah, or cloud of glory, for on them the visible glory of God rested. They were placed one at each end of the mercy-seat, with wings stretched upward, and their faces “toward each other and toward the mercy-seat.” They were anointed with holy oil, like the ark itself and the other sacred furniture.

 The cherubim were symbolical. They were intended to represent spiritual existences in immediate contact with Jehovah. Some have regarded them as symbolical of the chief ruling power by which God carries on his operations in providence ([Ps. 18:10](/ps#Ps.18.10)). Others interpret them as having reference to the redemption of men, and as symbolizing the great rulers or ministers of the church. Many other opinions have been held regarding them which need not be referred to here. On the whole, it seems to be most satisfactory to regard the interpretation of the symbol to be variable, as is the symbol itself.

 Their office was, (1) on the expulsion of our first parents from Eden, to prevent all access to the tree of life; and (2) to form the throne and chariot of Jehovah in his manifestation of himself on earth. He dwelleth between and sitteth on the cherubim ([1 Sam. 4:4](/1sam#1Sam.4.4); [Ps. 80:1](/ps#Ps.80.1); [Ezek. 1:26](/ezek#Ezek.1.26), [28](/ezek#Ezek.1.28)).",,,,,,UNVERIFIED,,,17966d02-d1c2-41f8-be5b-9f1d6e4c612a,,,,,32.53650368616845,44.42088287373876,C,cherub_287

It is about 48 miles west of Athens. The ancient city was destroyed by the Romans (B.C. 146), and that mentioned in the New Testament was quite a new city, having been rebuilt about a century afterwards and peopled by a colony of freedmen from Rome. It became under the Romans the seat of government for Southern Greece or Achaia ([Acts 18:12-16](/acts#Acts.18.12)). It was noted for its wealth, and for the luxurious and immoral and vicious habits of the people. It had a large mixed population of Romans, Greeks, and Jews. When Paul first visited the city (A.D. 51 or 52), Gallio, the brother of Seneca, was proconsul. Here Paul resided for eighteen months (18:1-18). Here he first became aquainted with Aquila and Priscilla, and soon after his departure Apollos came to it from Ephesus. After an interval he visited it a second time, and remained for three months (20:3). During this second visit his Epistle to the Romans was written (probably A.D. 55). Although there were many Jewish converts at Corinth, yet the Gentile element prevailed in the church there.

 Some have argued from [2 Cor. 12:14](/2cor#2Cor.12.14); [13:1](/2cor#2Cor.13.1), that Paul visited Corinth a third time (i.e., that on some unrecorded occasion he visited the city between what are usually called the first and second visits). But the passages referred to only indicate Paul’s intention to visit Corinth (comp. [1 Cor. 16:5](/1cor#1Cor.16.5), where the Greek present tense denotes an intention), an intention which was in some way frustrated.

From him the land of Cush seems to have derived its name. The question of the precise locality of the land of Cush has given rise to not a little controversy. The second river of Paradise surrounded the whole land of Cush ([Gen. 2:13](/gen#Gen.2.13), R.V.). The term Cush is in the Old Testament generally applied to the countries south of the Israelites. It was the southern limit of Egypt ([Ezek. 29:10](/ezek#Ezek.29.10), A.V. “Ethiopia,” Heb. Cush), with which it is generally associated ([Ps. 68:31](/ps#Ps.68.31); [Isa. 18:1](/isa#Isa.18.1); [Jer. 46:9](/jer#Jer.46.9), etc.). It stands also associated with Elam ([Isa. 11:11](/isa#Isa.11.11)), with Persia ([Ezek. 38:5](/ezek#Ezek.38.5)), and with the Sabeans ([Isa. 45:14](/isa#Isa.45.14)). From these facts it has been inferred that Cush included Arabia and the country on the west coast of the Red Sea. Rawlinson takes it to be the country still known as Khuzi-stan, on the east side of the Lower Tigris. But there are intimations which warrant the conclusion that there was also a Cush in Africa, the Ethiopia (so called by the Greeks) of Africa. Ezekiel speaks (29:10; comp. 30:4-6) of it as lying south of Egypt. It was the country now known to us as Nubia and Abyssinia ([Isa. 18:1](/isa#Isa.18.1); [Zeph. 3:10](/zeph#Zeph.3.10), Heb. Cush). In ancient Egyptian inscriptions Ethiopia is termed Kesh. The Cushites appear to have spread along extensive tracts, stretching from the Upper Nile to the Euphrates and Tigris. At an early period there was a stream of migration of Cushites “from Ethiopia, properly so called, through Arabia, Babylonia, and Persia, to Western India.” The Hamite races, soon after their arrival in Africa, began to spread north, east, and west. Three branches of the Cushite or Ethiopian stock, moving from Western Asia, settled in the regions contiguous to the Persian Gulf. One branch, called the Cossaeans, settled in the mountainous district on the east of the Tigris, known afterwards as Susiana; another occupied the lower regions of the Euphrates and the Tigris; while a third colonized the southern shores and islands of the gulf, whence they afterwards emigrated to the Mediterranean and settled on the coast of Palestine as the Phoenicians. Nimrod was a great Cushite chief.

Corn and wine and oil were produced here in the greatest perfection. It was rich also in timber and in mineral wealth.

 It is first mentioned in the New Testament ([Acts 4:36](/acts#Acts.4.36)) as the native place of Barnabas. It was the scene of Paul’s first missionary labours (13:4-13), when he and Barnabas and John Mark were sent forth by the church of Antioch.

Its modern name is Esh-Sham; i.e., “the East.”

 The situation of this city is said to be the most beautiful of all Western Asia. It is mentioned among the conquests of the Egyptian king Thothmes III. (B.C. 1500), and in the Amarna tablets (B.C. 1400).

 It is first mentioned in Scripture in connection with Abraham’s victory over the confederate kings under Chedorlaomer ([Gen. 14:15](/gen#Gen.14.15)). It was the native place of Abraham’s steward (15:2). It is not again noticed till the time of David, when “the Syrians of Damascus came to succour Hadadezer” (q.v.), [2 Sam. 8:5](/2sam#2Sam.8.5); [1 Chr. 18:5](/1chr#1Chr.18.5). In the reign of Solomon, Rezon became leader of a band who revolted from Hadadezer ([1 Kings 11:23](/1kgs#1Kgs.11.23)), and betaking themselves to Damascus, settled there and made their leader king. There was a long war, with varying success, between the Israelites and Syrians, who at a later period became allies of Israel against Judah ([2 Kings 15:37](/2kgs#2Kgs.15.37)).

 The Syrians were at length subdued by the Assyrians, the city of Damascus was taken and destroyed, and the inhabitants carried captive into Assyria ([2 Kings 16:7-9](/2kgs#2Kgs.16.7); comp. [Isa. 7:8](/isa#Isa.7.8)). In this, prophecy was fulfilled ([Isa. 17:1](/isa#Isa.17.1); [Amos 1:4](/amos#Amos.1.4); [Jer. 49:24](/jer#Jer.49.24)). The kingdom of Syria remained a province of Assyria till the capture of Nineveh by the Medes (B.C. 625), when it fell under the conquerors. After passing through various vicissitudes, Syria was invaded by the Romans (B.C. 64), and Damascus became the seat of the government of the province. In A.D. 37 Aretas, the king of Arabia, became master of Damascus, having driven back Herod Antipas.

 This city is memorable as the scene of Saul’s conversion ([Acts 9:1-25](/acts#Acts.9.1)). The street called “Straight,” in which Judas lived, in whose house Saul was found by Ananias, is known by the name Sultany, or “Queen’s Street.” It is the principal street of the city. Paul visited Damascus again on his return from Arabia ([Gal. 1:16](/gal#Gal.1.16), [17](/gal#Gal.1.17)). Christianity was planted here as a centre ([Acts 9:20](/acts#Acts.9.20)), from which it spread to the surrounding regions.

 In A.D. 634 Damascus was conquered by the growing Mohammedan power. In A.D. 1516 it fell under the dominion of the Turks, its present rulers. It is now the largest city in Asiatic Turkey.

His mother was Bilhah, Rachel’s maid ([Gen. 30:6](/gen#Gen.30.6), “God hath judged me”, Heb. dananni). The blessing pronounced on him by his father was, “Dan shall judge his people” (49:16), probably in allusion to the judgeship of Samson, who was of the tribe of Dan.

 The tribe of Dan had their place in the march through the wilderness on the north side of the tabernacle ([Num. 2:25](/num#Num.2.25), [31](/num#Num.2.31); 10:25). It was the last of the tribes to receive a portion in the Land of Promise. Its position and extent are described in [Josh. 19:40-48](/josh#Josh.19.40).

 The territory of Dan extended from the west of that of Ephraim and Benjamin to the sea. It was a small territory, but was very fertile. It included in it, among others, the cities of Lydda, Ekron, and Joppa, which formed its northern boundary. But this district was too limited. “Squeezed into the narrow strip between the mountains and the sea, its energies were great beyond its numbers.” Being pressed by the Amorites and the Philistines, whom they were unable to conquer, they longed for a wider space. They accordingly sent out five spies from two of their towns, who went north to the sources of the Jordan, and brought back a favourable report regarding that region. “Arise,” they said, “be not slothful to go, and to possess the land,” for it is “a place where there is no want of any thing that is in the earth” ([Judg. 18:10](/judg#Judg.18.10)). On receiving this report, 600 Danites girded on their weapons of war, and taking with them their wives and their children, marched to the foot of Hermon, and fought against Leshem, and took it from the Sidonians, and dwelt therein, and changed the name of the conquered town to Dan ([Josh. 19:47](/josh#Josh.19.47)). This new city of Dan became to them a new home, and was wont to be spoken of as the northern limit of Palestine, the length of which came to be denoted by the expression “from Dan to Beersheba”, i.e., about 144 miles.

 “But like Lot under a similar temptation, they seem to have succumbed to the evil influences around them, and to have sunk down into a condition of semi-heathenism from which they never emerged. The mounds of ruins which mark the site of the city show that it covered a considerable extent of ground. But there remains no record of any noble deed wrought by the degenerate tribe. Their name disappears from the roll-book of the natural and the spiritual Israel.”, Manning’s Those Holy Fields.

The region from about lat. 33 degrees 30’ to lat. 31 degrees, which is a very rich and fertile tract, has been by the most competent authorities agreed on as the probable site of Eden. “It is a region where streams abound, where they divide and re-unite, where alone in the Mesopotamian tract can be found the phenomenon of a single river parting into four arms, each of which is or has been a river of consequence.”

It was called the land, or “the mountain of Seir,” the rough hills on the east side of the Arabah. It extended from the head of the Gulf of Akabah, the Elanitic gulf, to the foot of the Dead Sea ([1 Kings 9:26](/1kgs#1Kgs.9.26)), and contained, among other cities, the rock-hewn Sela (q.v.), generally known by the Greek name Petra ([2 Kings 14:7](/2kgs#2Kgs.14.7)). It is a wild and rugged region, traversed by fruitful valleys. Its old capital was Bozrah ([Isa. 63:1](/isa#Isa.63.1)). The early inhabitants of the land were Horites. They were destroyed by the Edomites ([Deut. 2:12](/deut#Deut.2.12)), between whom and the kings of Israel and Judah there was frequent war ([2 Kings 8:20](/2kgs#2Kgs.8.20); [2 Chr. 28:17](/2chr#2Chr.28.17)).

 At the time of the Exodus they churlishly refused permission to the Israelites to pass through their land ([Num. 20:14-21](/num#Num.20.14)), and ever afterwards maintained an attitude of hostility toward them. They were conquered by David ([2 Sam. 8:14](/2sam#2Sam.8.14); comp. [1 Kings 9:26](/1kgs#1Kgs.9.26)), and afterwards by Amaziah ([2 Chr. 25:11](/2chr#2Chr.25.11), [12](/2chr#2Chr.25.12)). But they regained again their independence, and in later years, during the decline of the Jewish kingdom ([2 Kings 16:6](/2kgs#2Kgs.16.6); R.V. marg., “Edomites”), made war against Israel. They took part with the Chaldeans when Nebuchadnezzar captured Jerusalem, and afterwards they invaded and held possession of the south of Palestine as far as Hebron. At length, however, Edom fell under the growing Chaldean power ([Jer. 27:3](/jer#Jer.27.3), [6](/jer#Jer.27.6)).

 There are many prophecies concerning Edom ([Isa. 34:5](/isa#Isa.34.5), [6](/isa#Isa.34.6); [Jer. 49:7-18](/jer#Jer.49.7); [Ezek. 25:13](/ezek#Ezek.25.13); [35:1-15](/ezek#Ezek.35.1); [Joel 3:19](/joel#Joel.3.19); [Amos 1:11](/amos#Amos.1.11); Obad.; [Mal. 1:3](/mal#Mal.1.3), [4](/mal#Mal.1.4)) which have been remarkably fulfilled. The present desolate condition of that land is a standing testimony to the inspiration of these prophecies. After an existence as a people for above seventeen hundred years, they have utterly disappeared, and their language even is forgotten for ever. In Petra, “where kings kept their court, and where nobles assembled, there no man dwells; it is given by lot to birds, and beasts, and reptiles.”

 The Edomites were Semites, closely related in blood and in language to the Israelites. They dispossessed the Horites of Mount Seir; though it is clear, from [Gen. 36](/gen#Gen.36), that they afterwards intermarried with the conquered population. Edomite tribes settled also in the south of Judah, like the Kenizzites ([Gen. 36:11](/gen#Gen.36.11)), to whom Caleb and Othniel belonged ([Josh. 15:17](/josh#Josh.15.17)). The southern part of Edom was known as Teman.",http://pleiades.stoa.org/places/687927,31.25,34.75,,,VERIFIED,region,Idumaea,a3c6f3e3-74c3-497e-a4d4-a212b8e67304,,,,,31.25,34.75,E,edom_357

The wild region of which Edrei was the capital is thus described in its modern aspect: “Elevated about 20 feet above the plain, it is a labyrinth of clefts and crevasses in the rock, formed by volcanic action; and owing to its impenetrable condition, it has become a refuge for outlaws and turbulent characters, who make it a sort of Cave of Adullam...It is, in fact, an impregnable natural fortress, about 20 miles in length and 15 in breadth” (Porter’s Syria, etc.).

 The Egyptians belonged to the white race, and their original home is still a matter of dispute. Many scholars believe that it was in Southern Arabia, and recent excavations have shown that the valley of the Nile was originally inhabited by a low-class population, perhaps belonging to the Nigritian stock, before the Egyptians of history entered it. The ancient Egyptian language, of which the latest form is Coptic, is distantly connected with the Semitic family of speech.

 Egypt consists geographically of two halves, the northern being the Delta, and the southern Upper Egypt, between Cairo and the First Cataract. In the Old Testament, Northern or Lower Egypt is called Mazor, “the fortified land” ([Isa. 19:6](/isa#Isa.19.6); [37](/isa#Isa.37): 25, where the A.V. mistranslates “defence” and “besieged places”); while Southern or Upper Egypt is Pathros, the Egyptian Pa-to-Res, or “the land of the south” ([Isa. 11:11](/isa#Isa.11.11)). But the whole country is generally mentioned under the dual name of Mizraim, “the two Mazors.”

 The civilization of Egypt goes back to a very remote antiquity. The two kingdoms of the north and south were united by Menes, the founder of the first historical dynasty of kings. The first six dynasties constitute what is known as the Old Empire, which had its capital at Memphis, south of Cairo, called in the Old Testament Moph ([Hos. 9:6](/hos#Hos.9.6)) and Noph. The native name was Mennofer, “the good place.”

 The Pyramids were tombs of the monarchs of the Old Empire, those of Gizeh being erected in the time of the Fourth Dynasty. After the fall of the Old Empire came a period of decline and obscurity. This was followed by the Middle Empire, the most powerful dynasty of which was the Twelfth. The Fayyum was rescued for agriculture by the kings of the Twelfth Dynasty; and two obelisks were erected in front of the temple of the sun-god at On or Heliopolis (near Cairo), one of which is still standing. The capital of the Middle Empire was Thebes, in Upper Egypt.

 The Middle Empire was overthrown by the invasion of the Hyksos, or shepherd princes from Asia, who ruled over Egypt, more especially in the north, for several centuries, and of whom there were three dynasties of kings. They had their capital at Zoan or Tanis (now San), in the north-eastern part of the Delta. It was in the time of the Hyksos that Abraham, Jacob, and Joseph entered Egypt. The Hyksos were finally expelled about B.C. 1600, by the hereditary princes of Thebes, who founded the Eighteenth Dynasty, and carried the war into Asia. Canaan and Syria were subdued, as well as Cyprus, and the boundaries of the Egyptian Empire were fixed at the Euphrates. The Soudan, which had been conquered by the kings of the Twelfth Dynasty, was again annexed to Egypt, and the eldest son of the Pharaoh took the title of “Prince of Cush.”

 One of the later kings of the dynasty, Amenophis IV., or Khu-n-Aten, endeavoured to supplant the ancient state religion of Egypt by a new faith derived from Asia, which was a sort of pantheistic monotheism, the one supreme god being adored under the image of the solar disk. The attempt led to religious and civil war, and the Pharaoh retreated from Thebes to Central Egypt, where he built a new capital, on the site of the present Tell-el-Amarna. The cuneiform tablets that have been found there represent his foreign correspondence (about B.C. 1400). He surrounded himself with officials and courtiers of Asiatic, and more especially Canaanitish, extraction; but the native party succeeded eventually in overthrowing the government, the capital of Khu-n-Aten was destroyed, and the foreigners were driven out of the country, those that remained being reduced to serfdom.

 The national triumph was marked by the rise of the Nineteenth Dynasty, in the founder of which, Rameses I., we must see the “new king, who knew not Joseph.” His grandson, Rameses II., reigned sixty-seven years (B.C. 1348-1281), and was an indefatigable builder. As Pithom, excavated by Dr. Naville in 1883, was one of the cities he built, he must have been the Pharaoh of the Oppression. The Pharaoh of the Exodus may have been one of his immediate successors, whose reigns were short. Under them Egypt lost its empire in Asia, and was itself attacked by barbarians from Libya and the north.

 The Nineteenth Dynasty soon afterwards came to an end; Egypt was distracted by civil war; and for a short time a Canaanite, Arisu, ruled over it.

 Then came the Twentieth Dynasty, the second Pharaoh of which, Rameses III., restored the power of his country. In one of his campaigns he overran the southern part of Palestine, where the Israelites had not yet settled. They must at the time have been still in the wilderness. But it was during the reign of Rameses III. that Egypt finally lost Gaza and the adjoining cities, which were seized by the Pulista, or Philistines.

 After Rameses III., Egypt fell into decay. Solomon married the daughter of one of the last kings of the Twenty-first Dynasty, which was overthrown by Shishak I., the general of the Libyan mercenaries, who founded the Twenty-second Dynasty ([1 Kings 11:40](/1kgs#1Kgs.11.40); [14:25](/1kgs#1Kgs.14.25), [26](/1kgs#1Kgs.14.26)). A list of the places he captured in Palestine is engraved on the outside of the south wall of the temple of Karnak.

 In the time of Hezekiah, Egypt was conquered by Ethiopians from the Soudan, who constituted the Twenty-fifth Dynasty. The third of them was Tirhakah ([2 Kings 19:9](/2kgs#2Kgs.19.9)). In B.C. 674 it was conquered by the Assyrians, who divided it into twenty satrapies, and Tirhakah was driven back to his ancestral dominions. Fourteen years later it successfully revolted under Psammetichus I. of Sais, the founder of the Twenty-sixth Dynasty. Among his successors were Necho ([2 Kings 23:29](/2kgs#2Kgs.23.29)) and Hophra, or Apries ([Jer. 37:5](/jer#Jer.37.5), [7](/jer#Jer.37.7), [11](/jer#Jer.37.11)). The dynasty came to an end in B.C. 525, when the country was subjugated by Cambyses. Soon afterwards it was organized into a Persian satrapy.

 The title of Pharaoh, given to the Egyptian kings, is the Egyptian Per-aa, or “Great House,” which may be compared to that of “Sublime Porte.” It is found in very early Egyptian texts.

 The Egyptian religion was a strange mixture of pantheism and animal worship, the gods being adored in the form of animals. While the educated classes resolved their manifold deities into manifestations of one omnipresent and omnipotent divine power, the lower classes regarded the animals as incarnations of the gods.

 Under the Old Empire, Ptah, the Creator, the god of Memphis, was at the head of the Pantheon; afterwards Amon, the god of Thebes, took his place. Amon, like most of the other gods, was identified with Ra, the sun-god of Heliopolis.

 The Egyptians believed in a resurrection and future life, as well as in a state of rewards and punishments dependent on our conduct in this world. The judge of the dead was Osiris, who had been slain by Set, the representative of evil, and afterwards restored to life. His death was avenged by his son Horus, whom the Egyptians invoked as their “Redeemer.” Osiris and Horus, along with Isis, formed a trinity, who were regarded as representing the sun-god under different forms.

 Even in the time of Abraham, Egypt was a flourishing and settled monarchy. Its oldest capital, within the historic period, was Memphis, the ruins of which may still be seen near the Pyramids and the Sphinx. When the Old Empire of Menes came to an end, the seat of empire was shifted to Thebes, some 300 miles farther up the Nile. A short time after that, the Delta was conquered by the Hyksos, or shepherd kings, who fixed their capital at Zoan, the Greek Tanis, now San, on the Tanic arm of the Nile. All this occurred before the time of the new king “which knew not Joseph” ([Ex. 1:8](/exod#Exod.1.8)). In later times Egypt was conquered by the Persians (B.C. 525), and by the Greeks under Alexander the Great (B.C. 332), after whom the Ptolemies ruled the country for three centuries. Subsequently it was for a time a province of the Roman Empire; and at last, in A.D. 1517, it fell into the hands of the Turks, of whose empire it still forms nominally a part. Abraham and Sarah went to Egypt in the time of the shepherd kings. The exile of Joseph and the migration of Jacob to “the land of Goshen” occurred about 200 years later. On the death of Solomon, Shishak, king of Egypt, invaded Palestine ([1 Kings 14:25](/1kgs#1Kgs.14.25)). He left a list of the cities he conquered.

 A number of remarkable clay tablets, discovered at Tell-el-Amarna in Upper Egypt, are the most important historical records ever found in connection with the Bible. They most fully confirm the historical statements of the Book of Joshua, and prove the antiquity of civilization in Syria and Palestine. As the clay in different parts of Palestine differs, it has been found possible by the clay alone to decide where the tablets come from when the name of the writer is lost. The inscriptions are cuneiform, and in the Aramaic language, resembling Assyrian. The writers are Phoenicians, Amorites, and Philistines, but in no instance Hittites, though Hittites are mentioned. The tablets consist of official dispatches and letters, dating from B.C. 1480, addressed to the two Pharaohs, Amenophis III. and IV., the last of this dynasty, from the kings and governors of Phoenicia and Palestine. There occur the names of three kings killed by Joshua, Adoni-zedec, king of Jerusalem, Japhia, king of Lachish ([Josh. 10:3](/josh#Josh.10.3)), and Jabin, king of Hazor (11:1); also the Hebrews (Abiri) are said to have come from the desert.

 The principal prophecies of Scripture regarding Egypt are these, [Isa. 19](/isa#Isa.19); [Jer. 43](/jer#Jer.43): 8-13; 44:30; 46; [Ezek. 29](/ezek#Ezek.29)-32; and it might be easily shown that they have all been remarkably fulfilled.

land of the Nile and the pyramids, the oldest kingdom of which we have any record, holds a place of great significance in Scripture.

 The Egyptians belonged to the white race, and their original home is still a matter of dispute. Many scholars believe that it was in Southern Arabia, and recent excavations have shown that the valley of the Nile was originally inhabited by a low-class population, perhaps belonging to the Nigritian stock, before the Egyptians of history entered it. The ancient Egyptian language, of which the latest form is Coptic, is distantly connected with the Semitic family of speech.

 Egypt consists geographically of two halves, the northern being the Delta, and the southern Upper Egypt, between Cairo and the First Cataract. In the Old Testament, Northern or Lower Egypt is called Mazor, “the fortified land” ([Isa. 19:6](/isa#Isa.19.6); [37](/isa#Isa.37): 25, where the A.V. mistranslates “defence” and “besieged places”); while Southern or Upper Egypt is Pathros, the Egyptian Pa-to-Res, or “the land of the south” ([Isa. 11:11](/isa#Isa.11.11)). But the whole country is generally mentioned under the dual name of Mizraim, “the two Mazors.”

 The civilization of Egypt goes back to a very remote antiquity. The two kingdoms of the north and south were united by Menes, the founder of the first historical dynasty of kings. The first six dynasties constitute what is known as the Old Empire, which had its capital at Memphis, south of Cairo, called in the Old Testament Moph ([Hos. 9:6](/hos#Hos.9.6)) and Noph. The native name was Mennofer, “the good place.”

 The Pyramids were tombs of the monarchs of the Old Empire, those of Gizeh being erected in the time of the Fourth Dynasty. After the fall of the Old Empire came a period of decline and obscurity. This was followed by the Middle Empire, the most powerful dynasty of which was the Twelfth. The Fayyum was rescued for agriculture by the kings of the Twelfth Dynasty; and two obelisks were erected in front of the temple of the sun-god at On or Heliopolis (near Cairo), one of which is still standing. The capital of the Middle Empire was Thebes, in Upper Egypt.

 The Middle Empire was overthrown by the invasion of the Hyksos, or shepherd princes from Asia, who ruled over Egypt, more especially in the north, for several centuries, and of whom there were three dynasties of kings. They had their capital at Zoan or Tanis (now San), in the north-eastern part of the Delta. It was in the time of the Hyksos that Abraham, Jacob, and Joseph entered Egypt. The Hyksos were finally expelled about B.C. 1600, by the hereditary princes of Thebes, who founded the Eighteenth Dynasty, and carried the war into Asia. Canaan and Syria were subdued, as well as Cyprus, and the boundaries of the Egyptian Empire were fixed at the Euphrates. The Soudan, which had been conquered by the kings of the Twelfth Dynasty, was again annexed to Egypt, and the eldest son of the Pharaoh took the title of “Prince of Cush.”

 One of the later kings of the dynasty, Amenophis IV., or Khu-n-Aten, endeavoured to supplant the ancient state religion of Egypt by a new faith derived from Asia, which was a sort of pantheistic monotheism, the one supreme god being adored under the image of the solar disk. The attempt led to religious and civil war, and the Pharaoh retreated from Thebes to Central Egypt, where he built a new capital, on the site of the present Tell-el-Amarna. The cuneiform tablets that have been found there represent his foreign correspondence (about B.C. 1400). He surrounded himself with officials and courtiers of Asiatic, and more especially Canaanitish, extraction; but the native party succeeded eventually in overthrowing the government, the capital of Khu-n-Aten was destroyed, and the foreigners were driven out of the country, those that remained being reduced to serfdom.

 The national triumph was marked by the rise of the Nineteenth Dynasty, in the founder of which, Rameses I., we must see the “new king, who knew not Joseph.” His grandson, Rameses II., reigned sixty-seven years (B.C. 1348-1281), and was an indefatigable builder. As Pithom, excavated by Dr. Naville in 1883, was one of the cities he built, he must have been the Pharaoh of the Oppression. The Pharaoh of the Exodus may have been one of his immediate successors, whose reigns were short. Under them Egypt lost its empire in Asia, and was itself attacked by barbarians from Libya and the north.

 The Nineteenth Dynasty soon afterwards came to an end; Egypt was distracted by civil war; and for a short time a Canaanite, Arisu, ruled over it.

 Then came the Twentieth Dynasty, the second Pharaoh of which, Rameses III., restored the power of his country. In one of his campaigns he overran the southern part of Palestine, where the Israelites had not yet settled. They must at the time have been still in the wilderness. But it was during the reign of Rameses III. that Egypt finally lost Gaza and the adjoining cities, which were seized by the Pulista, or Philistines.

 After Rameses III., Egypt fell into decay. Solomon married the daughter of one of the last kings of the Twenty-first Dynasty, which was overthrown by Shishak I., the general of the Libyan mercenaries, who founded the Twenty-second Dynasty ([1 Kings 11:40](/1kgs#1Kgs.11.40); [14:25](/1kgs#1Kgs.14.25), [26](/1kgs#1Kgs.14.26)). A list of the places he captured in Palestine is engraved on the outside of the south wall of the temple of Karnak.

 In the time of Hezekiah, Egypt was conquered by Ethiopians from the Soudan, who constituted the Twenty-fifth Dynasty. The third of them was Tirhakah ([2 Kings 19:9](/2kgs#2Kgs.19.9)). In B.C. 674 it was conquered by the Assyrians, who divided it into twenty satrapies, and Tirhakah was driven back to his ancestral dominions. Fourteen years later it successfully revolted under Psammetichus I. of Sais, the founder of the Twenty-sixth Dynasty. Among his successors were Necho ([2 Kings 23:29](/2kgs#2Kgs.23.29)) and Hophra, or Apries ([Jer. 37:5](/jer#Jer.37.5), [7](/jer#Jer.37.7), [11](/jer#Jer.37.11)). The dynasty came to an end in B.C. 525, when the country was subjugated by Cambyses. Soon afterwards it was organized into a Persian satrapy.

 The title of Pharaoh, given to the Egyptian kings, is the Egyptian Per-aa, or “Great House,” which may be compared to that of “Sublime Porte.” It is found in very early Egyptian texts.

 The Egyptian religion was a strange mixture of pantheism and animal worship, the gods being adored in the form of animals. While the educated classes resolved their manifold deities into manifestations of one omnipresent and omnipotent divine power, the lower classes regarded the animals as incarnations of the gods.

 Under the Old Empire, Ptah, the Creator, the god of Memphis, was at the head of the Pantheon; afterwards Amon, the god of Thebes, took his place. Amon, like most of the other gods, was identified with Ra, the sun-god of Heliopolis.

 The Egyptians believed in a resurrection and future life, as well as in a state of rewards and punishments dependent on our conduct in this world. The judge of the dead was Osiris, who had been slain by Set, the representative of evil, and afterwards restored to life. His death was avenged by his son Horus, whom the Egyptians invoked as their “Redeemer.” Osiris and Horus, along with Isis, formed a trinity, who were regarded as representing the sun-god under different forms.

 Even in the time of Abraham, Egypt was a flourishing and settled monarchy. Its oldest capital, within the historic period, was Memphis, the ruins of which may still be seen near the Pyramids and the Sphinx. When the Old Empire of Menes came to an end, the seat of empire was shifted to Thebes, some 300 miles farther up the Nile. A short time after that, the Delta was conquered by the Hyksos, or shepherd kings, who fixed their capital at Zoan, the Greek Tanis, now San, on the Tanic arm of the Nile. All this occurred before the time of the new king “which knew not Joseph” ([Ex. 1:8](/exod#Exod.1.8)). In later times Egypt was conquered by the Persians (B.C. 525), and by the Greeks under Alexander the Great (B.C. 332), after whom the Ptolemies ruled the country for three centuries. Subsequently it was for a time a province of the Roman Empire; and at last, in A.D. 1517, it fell into the hands of the Turks, of whose empire it still forms nominally a part. Abraham and Sarah went to Egypt in the time of the shepherd kings. The exile of Joseph and the migration of Jacob to “the land of Goshen” occurred about 200 years later. On the death of Solomon, Shishak, king of Egypt, invaded Palestine ([1 Kings 14:25](/1kgs#1Kgs.14.25)). He left a list of the cities he conquered.

 A number of remarkable clay tablets, discovered at Tell-el-Amarna in Upper Egypt, are the most important historical records ever found in connection with the Bible. They most fully confirm the historical statements of the Book of Joshua, and prove the antiquity of civilization in Syria and Palestine. As the clay in different parts of Palestine differs, it has been found possible by the clay alone to decide where the tablets come from when the name of the writer is lost. The inscriptions are cuneiform, and in the Aramaic language, resembling Assyrian. The writers are Phoenicians, Amorites, and Philistines, but in no instance Hittites, though Hittites are mentioned. The tablets consist of official dispatches and letters, dating from B.C. 1480, addressed to the two Pharaohs, Amenophis III. and IV., the last of this dynasty, from the kings and governors of Phoenicia and Palestine. There occur the names of three kings killed by Joshua, Adoni-zedec, king of Jerusalem, Japhia, king of Lachish ([Josh. 10:3](/josh#Josh.10.3)), and Jabin, king of Hazor (11:1); also the Hebrews (Abiri) are said to have come from the desert.

 The principal prophecies of Scripture regarding Egypt are these, [Isa. 19](/isa#Isa.19); [Jer. 43](/jer#Jer.43): 8-13; 44:30; 46; [Ezek. 29](/ezek#Ezek.29)-32; and it might be easily shown that they have all been remarkably fulfilled. For example, the singular disappearance of Noph (i.e., Memphis) is a fulfilment of [Jer. 46:19](/jer#Jer.46.19), [Ezek. 30:13](/ezek#Ezek.30.13).",http://sws.geonames.org/357994,26.4902014068366,29.88079617,"aaron_1,joseph_1710,miriam_2087,moses_2108","amram_242,israel_682,joseph_1710",VERIFIED,,Egypt,2f0169bb-b510-4688-8fca-9ea9ea19ed0d,,Abraham goes to Egypt,Abraham's Sojourn in Canaan,"benjamin_463, moses_2108",26.4902014068366,29.88079617,E,egypt_362

The name Elam is an Assyrian word meaning “high.”

 “The inhabitants of Elam, or ‘the Highlands,’ to the east of Babylon, were called Elamites. They were divided into several branches, speaking different dialects of the same agglutinative language. The race to which they belonged was brachycephalic, or short-headed, like the pre-Semitic Sumerians of Babylonia.

 “The earliest Elamite kingdom seems to have been that of Anzan, the exact site of which is uncertain; but in the time of Abraham, Shushan or Susa appears to have already become the capital of the country. Babylonia was frequently invaded by the Elamite kings, who at times asserted their supremacy over it (as in the case of Chedorlaomer, the Kudur-Lagamar, or ‘servant of the goddess Lagamar,’ of the cuneiform texts).

 “The later Assyrian monarchs made several campaigns against Elam, and finally Assur-bani-pal (about B.C. 650) succeeded in conquering the country, which was ravaged with fire and sword. On the fall of the Assyrian Empire, Elam passed into the hands of the Persians” (A.H. Sayce).

 The vineyards of Engedi were celebrated in Solomon’s time ([Cant. 1:4](/song#Song.1.4)). It is the modern ‘Ain Jidy. The “fountain” from which it derives its name rises on the mountain side about 600 feet above the sea, and in its rapid descent spreads luxuriance all around it. Along its banks the osher grows abundantly. That shrub is thus described by Porter: “The stem is stout, measuring sometimes nearly a foot in diameter, and the plant grows to the height of 15 feet or more. It has a grayish bark and long oval leaves, which when broken off discharge a milky fluid. The fruit resembles an apple, and hangs in clusters of two or three. When ripe it is of a rich yellow colour, but on being pressed it explodes like a puff-ball.

It was colonized principally from Athens. In the time of the Romans it bore the title of “the first and greatest metropolis of Asia.” It was distinguished for the Temple of Diana (q.v.), who there had her chief shrine; and for its theatre, which was the largest in the world, capable of containing 50,000 spectators. It was, like all ancient theatres, open to the sky. Here were exhibited the fights of wild beasts and of men with beasts. (Comp. [1 Cor. 4:9](/1cor#1Cor.4.9); [9:24](/1cor#1Cor.9.24), [25](/1cor#1Cor.9.25); [15:32](/1cor#1Cor.15.32).)

 Many Jews took up their residence in this city, and here the seeds of the gospel were sown immediately after Pentecost ([Acts 2:9](/acts#Acts.2.9); [6:9](/acts#Acts.6.9)). At the close of his second missionary journey (about A.D. 51), when Paul was returning from Greece to Syria (18:18-21), he first visited this city. He remained, however, for only a short time, as he was hastening to keep the feast, probably of Pentecost, at Jerusalem; but he left Aquila and Priscilla behind him to carry on the work of spreading the gospel.

 During his third missionary journey Paul reached Ephesus from the “upper coasts” ([Acts 19:1](/acts#Acts.19.1)), i.e., from the inland parts of Asia Minor, and tarried here for about three years; and so successful and abundant were his labours that “all they which dwelt in Asia heard the word of the Lord Jesus, both Jews and Greeks” (19:10). Probably during this period the seven churches of the Apocalypse were founded, not by Paul’s personal labours, but by missionaries whom he may have sent out from Ephesus, and by the influence of converts returning to their homes.

 On his return from his journey, Paul touched at Miletus, some 30 miles south of Ephesus ([Acts 20:15](/acts#Acts.20.15)), and sending for the presbyters of Ephesus to meet him there, he delivered to them that touching farewell charge which is recorded in [Acts 20:18-35](/acts#Acts.20.18). Ephesus is not again mentioned till near the close of Paul’s life, when he writes to Timothy exhorting him to “abide still at Ephesus” ([1 Tim. 1:3](/1tim#1Tim.1.3)).

 Two of Paul’s companions, Trophimus and Tychicus, were probably natives of Ephesus ([Acts 20:4](/acts#Acts.20.4); [21:29](/acts#Acts.21.29); [2 Tim. 4:12](/2tim#2Tim.4.12)). In his second epistle to Timothy, Paul speaks of Onesiphorus as having served him in many things at Ephesus ([2 Tim. 1:18](/2tim#2Tim.1.18)). He also “sent Tychicus to Ephesus” (4:12), probably to attend to the interests of the church there. Ephesus is twice mentioned in the Apocalypse (1:11; 2:1).

 The apostle John, according to tradition, spent many years in Ephesus, where he died and was buried.

 A part of the site of this once famous city is now occupied by a small Turkish village, Ayasaluk, which is regarded as a corruption of the two Greek words, hagios theologos; i.e., “the holy divine.”",http://dare.ht.lu.se/places/21155,37.941944,27.339722,,,VERIFIED,"theatre,settlement,temple-2,architecturalcomplex","Ephesus/Arsinoe(ia)|Ephesos/Ephesus/Arsinoeia/Arsinoe, Efes, Selçuk",27766449-97f3-4ed1-9e7f-b8522b2c8c35,1Cor,"Return from Second Missionary Journey,Third Missionary Journey Begins,Mission to Ephesus/1 Cor Written,Riot in Ephesus","Second Missionary Journey, Third Missionary Journey, Third Missionary Journey, Third Missionary Journey","paul_2479, timotheus_2863, apollos_276, aquila_279, priscilla_2370, aristarchus_306, demetrius_1007, erastus_1213, alexander_188, gaius_1269, sceva_2480, tyrannus_2886",37.941944,27.339722,E,ephesus_400

The name of Edom, “red”, was also given to him from his conduct in connection with the red lentil “pottage” for which he sold his birthright (30, 31). The circumstances connected with his birth foreshadowed the enmity which afterwards subsisted between the twin brothers and the nations they founded (25:22, 23, 26). In process of time Jacob, following his natural bent, became a shepherd; while Esau, a “son of the desert,” devoted himself to the perilous and toilsome life of a huntsman. On a certain occasion, on returning from the chase, urged by the cravings of hunger, Esau sold his birthright to his brother, Jacob, who thereby obtained the covenant blessing ([Gen. 27:28](/gen#Gen.27.28), [29](/gen#Gen.27.29), [36](/gen#Gen.27.36); [Heb. 12:16](/heb#Heb.12.16), [17](/heb#Heb.12.17)). He afterwards tried to regain what he had so recklessly parted with, but was defeated in his attempts through the stealth of his brother ([Gen. 27:4](/gen#Gen.27.4), [34](/gen#Gen.27.34), [38](/gen#Gen.27.38)).

 At the age of forty years, to the great grief of his parents, he married ([Gen. 26:34](/gen#Gen.26.34), [35](/gen#Gen.26.35)) two Canaanitish maidens, Judith, the daughter of Beeri, and Bashemath, the daughter of Elon. When Jacob was sent away to Padan-aram, Esau tried to conciliate his parents ([Gen. 28:8](/gen#Gen.28.8), [9](/gen#Gen.28.9)) by marrying his cousin Mahalath, the daughter of Ishmael. This led him to cast in his lot with the Ishmaelite tribes; and driving the Horites out of Mount Seir, he settled in that region. After some thirty years’ sojourn in Padan-aram Jacob returned to Canaan, and was reconciled to Esau, who went forth to meet him (33:4). Twenty years after this, Isaac their father died, when the two brothers met, probably for the last time, beside his grave (35:29). Esau now permanently left Canaan, and established himself as a powerful and wealthy chief in the land of Edom (q.v.).

 Long after this, when the descendants of Jacob came out of Egypt, the Edomites remembered the old quarrel between the brothers, and with fierce hatred they warred against Israel.",,,,,,UNVERIFIED,,,504efc24-b45e-4d30-b13e-bdbb104f6ed6,,,,,30.734691,35.606250,E,esau_408

It corresponds generally with what is now known as the Soudan (i.e., the land of the blacks). This country was known to the Hebrews, and is described in [Isa. 18:1](/isa#Isa.18.1); [Zeph. 3:10](/zeph#Zeph.3.10). They carried on some commercial intercourse with it ([Isa. 45:14](/isa#Isa.45.14)).

 The Euphrates is first mentioned in [Gen. 2:14](/gen#Gen.2.14) as one of the rivers of Paradise. It is next mentioned in connection with the covenant which God entered into with Abraham (15:18), when he promised to his descendants the land from the river of Egypt to the river Euphrates (comp. [Deut. 11:24](/deut#Deut.11.24); [Josh. 1:4](/josh#Josh.1.4)), a covenant promise afterwards fulfilled in the extended conquests of David ([2 Sam. 8:2-14](/2sam#2Sam.8.2); [1 Chr. 18:3](/1chr#1Chr.18.3); [1 Kings 4:24](/1kgs#1Kgs.4.24)). It was then the boundary of the kingdom to the north-east. In the ancient history of Assyria, and Babylon, and Egypt many events are recorded in which mention is made of the “great river.” Just as the Nile represented in prophecy the power of Egypt, so the Euphrates represented the Assyrian power ([Isa. 8:7](/isa#Isa.8.7); [Jer. 2:18](/jer#Jer.2.18)).

 It is by far the largest and most important of all the rivers of Western Asia. From its source in the Armenian mountains to the Persian Gulf, into which it empties itself, it has a course of about 1,700 miles. It has two sources, (1) the Frat or Kara-su (i.e., “the black river”), which rises 25 miles north-east of Erzeroum; and (2) the Muradchai (i.e., “the river of desire”), which rises near Ararat, on the northern slope of Ala-tagh. At Kebban Maden, 400 miles from the source of the former, and 270 from that of the latter, they meet and form the majestic stream, which is at length joined by the Tigris at Koornah, after which it is called Shat-el-Arab, which runs in a deep and broad stream for above 140 miles to the sea. It is estimated that the alluvium brought down by these rivers encroaches on the sea at the rate of about one mile in thirty years.",http://pleiades.stoa.org/places/912849,34.74942377777777,40.93640094,,,VERIFIED,river,Euphrates (river),0b4b9c75-aa3b-4b97-9639-151619a6e3d5,,,,,34.74942377777777,40.93640094,E,euphrates_421

They were an intermixture of Gauls and Greeks, and hence were called Gallo-Graeci, and the country Gallo-Graecia. The Galatians were in their origin a part of that great Celtic migration which invaded Macedonia about B.C. 280. They were invited by the king of Bithynia to cross over into Asia Minor to assist him in his wars. There they ultimately settled, and being strengthened by fresh accessions of the same clan from Europe, they overran Bithynia, and supported themselves by plundering neighbouring countries. They were great warriors, and hired themselves out as mercenary soldiers, sometimes fighting on both sides in the great battles of the times. They were at length brought under the power of Rome in B.C. 189, and Galatia became a Roman province B.C. 25.

 This province of Galatia, within the limits of which these Celtic tribes were confined, was the central region of Asia Minor.

 During his second missionary journey Paul, accompanied by Silas and Timothy ([Acts 16:6](/acts#Acts.16.6)), visited the “region of Galatia,” where he was detained by sickness ([Gal. 4:13](/gal#Gal.4.13)), and had thus the longer opportunity of preaching to them the gospel.

Solomon rewarded Hiram for certain services rendered him by the gift of an upland plain among the mountains of Naphtali. Hiram was dissatisfied with the gift, and called it “the land of Cabul” (q.v.). The Jews called it Galil. It continued long to be occupied by the original inhabitants, and hence came to be called “Galilee of the Gentiles” ([Matt. 4:15](/matt#Matt.4.15)), and also “Upper Galilee,” to distinguish it from the extensive addition afterwards made to it toward the south, which was usually called “Lower Galilee.” In the time of our Lord, Galilee embraced more than one-third of Western Palestine, extending “from Dan on the north, at the base of Mount Hermon, to the ridges of Carmel and Gilboa on the south, and from the Jordan valley on the east away across the splendid plains of Jezreel and Acre to the shores of the Mediterranean on the west.” Palestine was divided into three provinces, Judea, Samaria, and Galilee, which comprehended the whole northern section of the country ([Acts 9:31](/acts#Acts.9.31)), and was the largest of the three.

 It was the scene of some of the most memorable events of Jewish history. Galilee also was the home of our Lord during at least thirty years of his life. The first three Gospels are chiefly taken up with our Lord’s public ministry in this province. “The entire province is encircled with a halo of holy associations connected with the life, works, and teachings of Jesus of Nazareth.” “It is noteworthy that of his thirty-two beautiful parables, no less than ninteen were spoken in Galilee. And it is no less remarkable that of his entire thirty-three great miracles, twenty-five were wrought in this province. His first miracle was wrought at the wedding in Cana of Galilee, and his last, after his resurrection, on the shore of Galilee’s sea. In Galilee our Lord delivered the Sermon on The Mount, and the discourses on ‘The Bread of Life,’ on ‘Purity,’ on ’Forgiveness,’ and on ‘Humility.’ In Galilee he called his first disciples; and there occurred the sublime scene of the Transfiguration” (Porter’s Through Samaria).

 When the Sanhedrin were about to proceed with some plan for the condemnation of our Lord ([John 7:45-52](/john#John.7.45)), Nicodemus interposed in his behalf. (Comp. [Deut. 1:16](/deut#Deut.1.16), [17](/deut#Deut.1.17); 17:8.) They replied, “Art thou also of Galilee?... Out of Galilee ariseth no prophet.” This saying of theirs was “not historically true, for two prophets at least had arisen from Galilee, Jonah of Gath-hepher, and the greatest of all the prophets, Elijah of Thisbe, and perhaps also Nahum and Hosea. Their contempt for Galilee made them lose sight of historical accuracy” (Alford, Com.).

 The Galilean accent differed from that of Jerusalem in being broader and more guttural ([Mark 14:70](/mark#Mark.14.70)).",,,,,,NOT_IDENTIFIABLE,,,d8dc8e66-eaf0-463e-82a3-c9b8441a91c9,,,,,32.70674542474383,35.30152807767973,G,galilee_433

The plot of ground pointed out as Gethsemane is now surrounded by a wall, and is laid out as a modern European flower-garden. It contains eight venerable olive-trees, the age of which cannot, however, be determined. The exact site of Gethsemane is still in question. Dr. Thomson (The Land and the Book) says: “When I first came to Jerusalem, and for many years afterward, this plot of ground was open to all whenever they chose to come and meditate beneath its very old olivetrees. The Latins, however, have within the last few years succeeded in gaining sole possession, and have built a high wall around it...The Greeks have invented another site a little to the north of it...My own impression is that both are wrong. The position is too near the city, and so close to what must have always been the great thoroughfare eastward, that our Lord would scarcely have selected it for retirement on that dangerous and dismal night...I am inclined to place the garden in the secluded vale several hundred yards to the north-east of the present Gethsemane.”",,,,,,UNVERIFIED,,,46990b87-c2a0-4da5-b319-3d25b2c74453,,,,,31.777444,35.234935,G,gethsemane_462

Its inhabitants were Hivites (11:19). It lay within the territory of Benjamin, and became a priest-city (18:25; 21:17). Here the tabernacle was set up after the destruction of Nob, and here it remained many years till the temple was built by Solomon. It is represented by the modern el-Jib, to the south-west of Ai, and about 5 1/2 miles north-north-west of Jerusalem.

 A deputation of the Gibeonites, with their allies from three other cities ([Josh. 9](/josh#Josh.9);[17](/josh#Josh.17)), visited the camp at Gilgal, and by false representations induced Joshua to enter into a league with them, although the Israelites had been specially warned against any league with the inhabitants of Canaan ([Ex. 23:32](/exod#Exod.23.32); [34:12](/exod#Exod.34.12); [Num. 33:55](/num#Num.33.55); [Deut. 7:2](/deut#Deut.7.2)). The deception practised on Joshua was detected three days later; but the oath rashly sworn “by Jehovah God of Israel” was kept, and the lives of the Gibeonites were spared. They were, however, made “bondmen” to the sanctuary ([Josh. 9:23](/josh#Josh.9.23)).

 The most remarkable incident connected with this city was the victory Joshua gained over the kings of Palestine ([Josh. 10:16-27](/josh#Josh.10.16)). The battle here fought has been regarded as “one of the most important in the history of the world.” The kings of southern Canaan entered into a confederacy against Gibeon (because it had entered into a league with Joshua) under the leadership of Adoni-zedec, king of Jerusalem, and marched upon Gibeon with the view of taking possession of it. The Gibeonites entreated Joshua to come to their aid with the utmost speed. His army came suddenly upon that of the Amorite kings as it lay encamped before the city. It was completely routed, and only broken remnants of their great host found refuge in the fenced cities. The five confederate kings who led the army were taken prisoners, and put to death at Makkedah (q.v.). This eventful battle of Beth-horon sealed the fate of all the cities of Southern Palestine. Among the Amarna tablets is a letter from Adoni-zedec (q.v.) to the king of Egypt, written probably at Makkedah after the defeat, showing that the kings contemplated flight into Egypt.

 This place is again brought into notice as the scene of a battle between the army of Ish-bosheth under Abner and that of David led by Joab. At the suggestion of Abner, to spare the effusion of blood twelve men on either side were chosen to decide the battle. The issue was unexpected; for each of the men slew his fellow, and thus they all perished. The two armies then engaged in battle, in which Abner and his host were routed and put to flight ([2 Sam. 2:12-17](/2sam#2Sam.2.12)). This battle led to a virtual truce between Judah and Israel, Judah, under David, increasing in power; and Israel, under Ish-bosheth, continually losing ground.

 Soon after the death of Absalom and David’s restoration to his throne his kingdom was visited by a grievous famine, which was found to be a punishment for Saul’s violation ([2 Sam. 21:2](/2sam#2Sam.21.2), [5](/2sam#2Sam.21.5)) of the covenant with the Gibeonites ([Josh. 9:3-27](/josh#Josh.9.3)). The Gibeonites demanded blood for the wrong that had been done to them, and accordingly David gave up to them the two sons of Rizpah (q.v.) and the five sons of Michal, and these the Gibeonites took and hanged or crucified “in the hill before the Lord” ([2 Sam. 21:9](/2sam#2Sam.21.9)); and there the bodies hung for six months (21:10), and all the while Rizpah watched over the blackening corpses and “suffered neither the birds of the air to rest on them by day, nor the beasts of the field by night.” David afterwards removed the bones of Saul and Jonathan at Jabeshgilead (21:12, 13).

 Here, “at the great stone,” Amasa was put to death by Joab ([2 Sam. 20:5-10](/2sam#2Sam.20.5)). To the altar of burnt-offering which was at Gibeon, Joab ([1 Kings 2:28-34](/1kgs#1Kgs.2.28)), who had taken the side of Adonijah, fled for sanctuary in the beginning of Solomon’s reign, and was there also slain by the hand of Benaiah.

 Soon after he came to the throne, Solomon paid a visit of state to Gibeon, there to offer sacrifices ([1 Kings 3:4](/1kgs#1Kgs.3.4); [2 Chr. 1:3](/2chr#2Chr.1.3)). On this occasion the Lord appeared to him in a memorable dream, recorded in [1 Kings 3:5-15](/1kgs#1Kgs.3.5); [2 Chr. 1:7-12](/2chr#2Chr.1.7). When the temple was built “all the men of Israel assembled themselves” to king Solomon, and brought up from Gibeon the tabernacle and “all the holy vessels that were in the tabernacle” to Jerusalem, where they remained till they were carried away by Nebuchadnezzar ([2 Kings 24:13](/2kgs#2Kgs.24.13)).",http://pleiades.stoa.org/places/687900,31.84668,35.1852,,asahel_320,VERIFIED,settlement,"Gabaon|Gabaon, el Jib",b23ad5c7-d015-4ea4-924d-e6c7c916067d,,,,,31.84668,35.1852,G,gibeon_470

On the occasion of the approach of the Assyrian army under Sennacherib, Hezekiah, in order to prevent the besiegers from finding water, “stopped the upper water course of Gihon, and brought it straight down to the west side of the city of David” ([2 Chr. 32:30](/2chr#2Chr.32.30); [33:14](/2chr#2Chr.33.14)). This “fountain” or spring is therefore to be regarded as the “upper water course of Gihon.” From this “fountain” a tunnel cut through the ridge which forms the south part of the temple hill conveys the water to the Pool of Siloam, which lies on the opposite side of this ridge at the head of the Tyropoeon (“cheesemakers’”) valley, or valley of the son of Hinnom, now filled up by rubbish. The length of this tunnel is about 1,750 feet. In 1880 an inscription was accidentally discovered on the wall of the tunnel about nineteen feet from where it opens into the Pool of Siloam. This inscription was executed in all probability by Hezekiah’s workmen. It briefly narrates the history of the excavation. It may, however, be possible that this tunnel was executed in the time of Solomon. If the “waters of Shiloah that go softly” ([Isa. 8:6](/isa#Isa.8.6)) refers to the gentle stream that still flows through the tunnel into the Pool of Siloam, then this excavation must have existed before the time of Hezekiah.

 In the upper part of the Tyropoeoan valley there are two pools still existing, the first, called Birket el-Mamilla, to the west of the Jaffa gate; the second, to the south of the first, called Birket es-Sultan. It is the opinion of some that the former was the “upper” and the latter the “lower” Pool of Gihon ([2 Kings 18:17](/2kgs#2Kgs.18.17); [Isa. 7:3](/isa#Isa.7.3); [36:2](/isa#Isa.36.2); [22:9](/isa#Isa.22.9)).",,,,,,UNVERIFIED,,,63d8482a-353b-4e29-9000-a913bb50b2e7,,,,,31.773116,35.237186,G,gihon_473

But “all these interpretations are unsatisfactory and inadequate. The vision respecting Gog and Magog in the Apocalypse ([Rev. 20:8](/rev#Rev.20.8)) is in substance a reannouncement of this prophecy of Ezekiel. But while Ezekiel contemplates the great conflict in a more general light as what was certainly to be connected with the times of the Messiah, and should come then to its last decisive issues, John, on the other hand, writing from the commencement of the Messiah’s times, describes there the last struggles and victories of the cause of Christ. In both cases alike the vision describes the final workings of the world’s evil and its results in connection with the kingdom of God, only the starting-point is placed further in advance in the one case than in the other.”

David and Saul never afterwards met. ([1 Sam. 26:13-25](/1sam#1Sam.26.13)).",,,,,,UNVERIFIED,,,a7ba212a-ff4e-4584-9a76-88b9703001d8,,,,,31.466604,35.216691,H,hachilah_500

 Hamath, now Hamah, had an Aramaean population, but Hittite monuments discovered there show that it must have been at one time occupied by the Hittites. It was among the conquests of the Pharaoh Thothmes III. Its king, Tou or Toi, made alliance with David ([2 Sam. 8:10](/2sam#2Sam.8.10)), and in B.C. 740 Azariah formed a league with it against Assyria. It was, however, conquered by the Assyrians, and its nineteen districts placed under Assyrian governors. In B.C. 720 it revolted under a certain Yahu-bihdi, whose name, compounded with that of the God of Israel (Yahu), perhaps shows that he was of Jewish origin. But the revolt was suppressed, and the people of Hamath were transported to Samaria ([2 Kings 17:24](/2kgs#2Kgs.17.24), [30](/2kgs#2Kgs.17.30)), where they continued to worship their god Ashima. Hamah is beautifully situated on the Orontes, 32 miles north of Emesa, and 36 south of the ruins of Assamea.

 The kingdom of Hamath comprehended the great plain lying on both banks of the Orontes from the fountain near Riblah to Assamea on the north, and from Lebanon on the west to the desert on the east. The “entrance of Hamath” ([Num. 34:8](/num#Num.34.8)), which was the north boundary of Palestine, led from the west between the north end of Lebanon and the Nusairiyeh mountains.",http://dare.ht.lu.se/places/21720,35.1359,36.7495,,,VERIFIED,settlement,"Amathe/Epiphaneia|Amathe/Epiphaneia, Hamah",c9ce3c14-9b5c-47c5-9b6a-10b46d4d9c7b,,,,hamathite_1361,35.1359,36.7495,H,hamath_516

It was built “seven years before Zoan in Egypt” ([Gen. 13:18](/gen#Gen.13.18); [Num. 13:22](/num#Num.13.22)). It still exists under the same name, and is one of the most ancient cities in the world. Its earlier name was Kirjath-arba ([Gen. 23:2](/gen#Gen.23.2); [Josh. 14:15](/josh#Josh.14.15); [15:3](/josh#Josh.15.3)). But “Hebron would appear to have been the original name of the city, and it was not till after Abraham’s stay there that it received the name Kirjath-arba, who [i.e., Arba] was not the founder but the conqueror of the city, having led thither the tribe of the Anakim, to which he belonged. It retained this name till it came into the possession of Caleb, when the Israelites restored the original name Hebron” (Keil, Com.). The name of this city does not occur in any of the prophets or in the New Testament. It is found about forty times in the Old. It was the favorite home of Abraham. Here he pitched his tent under the oaks of Mamre, by which name it came afterwards to be known; and here Sarah died, and was buried in the cave of Machpelah ([Gen. 23:17-20](/gen#Gen.23.17)), which he bought from Ephron the Hittite. From this place the patriarch departed for Egypt by way of Beersheba (37:14; 46:1). It was taken by Joshua and given to Caleb ([Josh. 10:36](/josh#Josh.10.36), [37](/josh#Josh.10.37); 12:10; 14:13). It became a Levitical city and a city of refuge (20:7; 21:11). When David became king of Judah this was his royal residence, and he resided here for seven and a half years ([2 Sam. 5:5](/2sam#2Sam.5.5)); and here he was anointed as king over all Israel ([2 Sam. 2:1-4](/2sam#2Sam.2.1), [11](/2sam#2Sam.2.11); [1 Kings 2:11](/1kgs#1Kgs.2.11)). It became the residence also of the rebellious Absalom ([2 Sam. 15:10](/2sam#2Sam.15.10)), who probably expected to find his chief support in the tribe of Judah, now called el-Khulil.

 In one part of the modern city is a great mosque, which is built over the grave of Machpelah. The first European who was permitted to enter this mosque was the Prince of Wales in 1862. It was also visited by the Marquis of Bute in 1866, and by the late Emperor Frederick of Germany (then Crown-Prince of Prussia) in 1869.

 One of the largest oaks in Palestine is found in the valley of Eshcol, about 3 miles north of the town. It is supposed by some to be the tree under which Abraham pitched his tent, and is called “Abraham’s oak.”",http://dare.ht.lu.se/places/28353,31.524354,35.108539,"absalom_59,adonijah_97,amnon_232,daniel_939,ithream_655,shephatiah_2657",,VERIFIED,settlement,"Hebron|Hebron, el Khalil",a44e3ef5-e4d4-42bd-818d-07e6d9f4fd49,,Abraham and Lot Separate,Abraham's Sojourn in Canaan,,31.524354,35.108539,H,hebron_551

After the battle of Gilboa, so fatal to Saul and his house, David, as divinely directed, took up his residence in Hebron, and was there anointed king over Judah. Among the fugitives from Gilboa was Ish-bosheth, the only surviving son of Saul, whom Abner, Saul’s uncle, took across the Jordan to Mahanaim, and there had him proclaimed king. Abner gathered all the forces at his command and marched to Gibeon, with the object of wresting Judah from David. Joab had the command of David’s army of trained men, who encamped on the south of the pool, which was on the east of the hill on which the town of Gibeon was built, while Abner’s army lay on the north of the pool. Abner proposed that the conflict should be decided by twelve young men engaging in personal combat on either side. So fiercely did they encounter each other that “they caught every man his fellow by the head, and thrust his sword in his fellow’s side; so they fell down together: wherefore that place was called Helkath-hazzurim.” The combat of the champions was thus indecisive, and there followed a severe general engagement between the two armies, ending in the total rout of the Israelites under Abner.

Its site was near the ‘Ain es-Sultan, Elisha’s Fountain ([2 Kings 2:19-22](/2kgs#2Kgs.2.19)), about 5 miles west of Jordan. It was the most important city in the Jordan valley ([Num. 22:1](/num#Num.22.1); [34:15](/num#Num.34.15)), and the strongest fortress in all the land of Canaan. It was the key to Western Palestine.

 This city was taken in a very remarkable manner by the Israelites ([Josh. 6](/josh#Josh.6)). God gave it into their hands. The city was “accursed” (Heb. herem, “devoted” to Jehovah), and accordingly ([Josh. 6:17](/josh#Josh.6.17); comp. [Lev. 27:28](/lev#Lev.27.28), [29](/lev#Lev.27.29); [Deut. 13:16](/deut#Deut.13.16)) all the inhabitants and all the spoil of the city were to be destroyed, “only the silver, and the gold, and the vessels of brass and of iron” were reserved and “put into the treasury of the house of Jehovah” ([Josh. 6:24](/josh#Josh.6.24); comp. [Num. 31:22](/num#Num.31.22), [23](/num#Num.31.23), [50](/num#Num.31.50)-54). Only Rahab “and her father’s household, and all that she had,” were preserved from destruction, according to the promise of the spies ([Josh. 2:14](/josh#Josh.2.14)). In one of the Amarna tablets Adoni-zedec (q.v.) writes to the king of Egypt informing him that the ‘Abiri (Hebrews) had prevailed, and had taken the fortress of Jericho, and were plundering “all the king’s lands.” It would seem that the Egyptian troops had before this been withdrawn from Palestine.

 This city was given to the tribe of Benjamin ([Josh. 18:21](/josh#Josh.18.21)), and it was inhabited in the time of the Judges ([Judg. 3:13](/judg#Judg.3.13); [2 Sam. 10:5](/2sam#2Sam.10.5)). It is not again mentioned till the time of David ([2 Sam. 10:5](/2sam#2Sam.10.5)). “Children of Jericho” were among the captives who returned under Zerubbabel [Ezra 2:34](/ezra#Ezra.2.34); [Neh. 7:36](/neh#Neh.7.36)). Hiel (q.v.) the Bethelite attempted to make it once more a fortified city ([1 Kings 16:34](/1kgs#1Kgs.16.34)). Between the beginning and the end of his undertaking all his children were cut off.

 In New Testament times Jericho stood some distance to the south-east of the ancient one, and near the opening of the valley of Achor. It was a rich and flourishing town, having a considerable trade, and celebrated for the palm trees which adorned the plain around. It was visited by our Lord on his last journey to Jerusalem. Here he gave sight to two blind men ([Matt. 20:29-34](/matt#Matt.20.29); [Mark 10:46-52](/mark#Mark.10.46)), and brought salvation to the house of Zacchaeus the publican ([Luke 19:2-10](/luke#Luke.19.2)).

 The poor hamlet of er-Riha, the representative of modern Jericho, is situated some two miles farther to the east. It is in a ruinous condition, having been destroyed by the Turks in 1840. “The soil of the plain,” about the middle of which the ancient city stood, “is unsurpassed in fertility; there is abundance of water for irrigation, and many of the old aqueducts are almost perfect; yet nearly the whole plain is waste and desolate...The climate of Jericho is exceedingly hot and unhealthy. This is accounted for by the depression of the plain, which is about 1,200 feet below the level of the sea.”

 There were three different Jerichos, on three different sites, the Jericho of Joshua, the Jericho of Herod, and the Jericho of the Crusades. Er-Riha, the modern Jericho, dates from the time of the Crusades. Dr. Bliss has found in a hollow scooped out for some purpose or other near the foot of the biggest mound above the Sultan’s Spring specimens of Amorite or pre-Israelitish pottery precisely identical with what he had discovered on the site of ancient Lachish. He also traced in this place for a short distance a mud brick wall in situ, which he supposes to be the very wall that fell before the trumpets of Joshua. The wall is not far from the foot of the great precipice of Quarantania and its numerous caverns, and the spies of Joshua could easily have fled from the city and been speedily hidden in these fastnesses.",http://pleiades.stoa.org/places/687917,31.8700465,35.443876,,,VERIFIED,settlement,"Hierichous|Hierichous, Jericho",2b6aa469-b842-4d60-a06e-0e990b4ecb00,,,,,31.8700465,35.443876,J,jericho_634

also Salem, Ariel, Jebus, the “city of God,” the “holy city;” by the modern Arabs el-Khuds, meaning “the holy;” once “the city of Judah” ([2 Chr. 25:28](/2chr#2Chr.25.28)). This name is in the original in the dual form, and means “possession of peace,” or “foundation of peace.” The dual form probably refers to the two mountains on which it was built, viz., Zion and Moriah; or, as some suppose, to the two parts of the city, the “upper” and the “lower city.” Jerusalem is a “mountain city enthroned on a mountain fastness” (comp. [Ps. 68:15](/ps#Ps.68.15), [16](/ps#Ps.68.16); 87:1; 125:2; 76:1, 2; 122:3). It stands on the edge of one of the highest table-lands in Palestine, and is surrounded on the south-eastern, the southern, and the western sides by deep and precipitous ravines.

 It is first mentioned in Scripture under the name Salem ([Gen. 14:18](/gen#Gen.14.18); comp. [Ps. 76:2](/ps#Ps.76.2)). When first mentioned under the name Jerusalem, Adonizedek was its king ([Josh. 10:1](/josh#Josh.10.1)). It is afterwards named among the cities of Benjamin ([Judg. 19:10](/judg#Judg.19.10); [1 Chr. 11:4](/1chr#1Chr.11.4)); but in the time of David it was divided between Benjamin and Judah. After the death of Joshua the city was taken and set on fire by the men of Judah ([Judg. 1:1-8](/judg#Judg.1.1)); but the Jebusites were not wholly driven out of it. The city is not again mentioned till we are told that David brought the head of Goliath thither ([1 Sam. 17:54](/1sam#1Sam.17.54)). David afterwards led his forces against the Jebusites still residing within its walls, and drove them out, fixing his own dwelling on Zion, which he called “the city of David” ([2 Sam. 5:5-9](/2sam#2Sam.5.5); [1 Chr. 11:4-8](/1chr#1Chr.11.4)). Here he built an altar to the Lord on the threshing-floor of Araunah the Jebusite ([2 Sam. 24:15-25](/2sam#2Sam.24.15)), and thither he brought up the ark of the covenant and placed it in the new tabernacle which he had prepared for it. Jerusalem now became the capital of the kingdom.

 After the death of David, Solomon built the temple, a house for the name of the Lord, on Mount Moriah (B.C. 1010). He also greatly strengthened and adorned the city, and it became the great centre of all the civil and religious affairs of the nation ([Deut. 12:5](/deut#Deut.12.5); comp. 12:14; 14:23; 16:11-16; [Ps. 122](/ps#Ps.122)).

 After the disruption of the kingdom on the accession to the throne of Rehoboam, the son of Solomon, Jerusalem became the capital of the kingdom of the two tribes. It was subsequently often taken and retaken by the Egyptians, the Assyrians, and by the kings of Israel ([2 Kings 14:13](/2kgs#2Kgs.14.13), [14](/2kgs#2Kgs.14.14); 18:15, 16; 23:33-35; 24:14; [2 Chr. 12:9](/2chr#2Chr.12.9); [26:9](/2chr#2Chr.26.9); [27:3](/2chr#2Chr.27.3), [4](/2chr#2Chr.27.4); [29:3](/2chr#2Chr.29.3); [32:30](/2chr#2Chr.32.30); [33:11](/2chr#2Chr.33.11)), till finally, for the abounding iniquities of the nation, after a siege of three years, it was taken and utterly destroyed, its walls razed to the ground, and its temple and palaces consumed by fire, by Nebuchadnezzar, the king of Babylon ([2 Kings 25](/2kgs#2Kgs.25); [2 Chr. 36](/2chr#2Chr.36); [Jer. 39](/jer#Jer.39)), B.C. 588. The desolation of the city and the land was completed by the retreat of the principal Jews into Egypt ([Jer. 40](/jer#Jer.40)-44), and by the final carrying captive into Babylon of all that still remained in the land (52:3), so that it was left without an inhabitant (B.C. 582). Compare the predictions, [Deut. 28](/deut#Deut.28); [Lev. 26:14-39](/lev#Lev.26.14).

 But the streets and walls of Jerusalem were again to be built, in troublous times ([Dan. 9:16](/dan#Dan.9.16), [19](/dan#Dan.9.19), [25](/dan#Dan.9.25)), after a captivity of seventy years. This restoration was begun B.C. 536, “in the first year of Cyrus” ([Ezra 1:2](/ezra#Ezra.1.2), [3](/ezra#Ezra.1.3), [5](/ezra#Ezra.1.5)-11). The Books of Ezra and Nehemiah contain the history of the re-building of the city and temple, and the restoration of the kingdom of the Jews, consisting of a portion of all the tribes. The kingdom thus constituted was for two centuries under the dominion of Persia, till B.C. 331; and thereafter, for about a century and a half, under the rulers of the Greek empire in Asia, till B.C. 167. For a century the Jews maintained their independence under native rulers, the Asmonean princes. At the close of this period they fell under the rule of Herod and of members of his family, but practically under Rome, till the time of the destruction of Jerusalem, A.D. 70. The city was then laid in ruins.

 The modern Jerusalem by-and-by began to be built over the immense beds of rubbish resulting from the overthrow of the ancient city; and whilst it occupies certainly the same site, there are no evidences that even the lines of its streets are now what they were in the ancient city. Till A.D. 131 the Jews who still lingered about Jerusalem quietly submitted to the Roman sway. But in that year the emperor (Hadrian), in order to hold them in subjection, rebuilt and fortified the city. The Jews, however, took possession of it, having risen under the leadership of one Bar-Chohaba (i.e., “the son of the star”) in revolt against the Romans. Some four years afterwards (A.D. 135), however, they were driven out of it with great slaughter, and the city was again destroyed; and over its ruins was built a Roman city called Aelia Capitolina, a name which it retained till it fell under the dominion of the Mohammedans, when it was called el-Khuds, i.e., “the holy.”

 In A.D. 326 Helena, mother of the emperor Constantine, made a pilgrimage to Jerusalem with the view of discovering the places mentioned in the life of our Lord. She caused a church to be built on what was then supposed to be the place of the nativity at Bethlehem. Constantine, animated by her example, searched for the holy sepulchre, and built over the supposed site a magnificent church, which was completed and dedicated A.D. 335. He relaxed the laws against the Jews till this time in force, and permitted them once a year to visit the city and wail over the desolation of “the holy and beautiful house.”

 In A.D. 614 the Persians, after defeating the Roman forces of the emperor Heraclius, took Jerusalem by storm, and retained it till A.D. 637, when it was taken by the Arabians under the Khalif Omar. It remained in their possession till it passed, in A.D. 960, under the dominion of the Fatimite khalifs of Egypt, and in A.D. 1073 under the Turcomans. In A.D. 1099 the crusader Godfrey of Bouillon took the city from the Moslems with great slaughter, and was elected king of Jerusalem. He converted the Mosque of Omar into a Christian cathedral. During the eighty-eight years which followed, many churches and convents were erected in the holy city. The Church of the Holy Sepulchre was rebuilt during this period, and it alone remains to this day. In A.D. 1187 the sultan Saladin wrested the city from the Christians. From that time to the present day, with few intervals, Jerusalem has remained in the hands of the Moslems. It has, however, during that period been again and again taken and retaken, demolished in great part and rebuilt, no city in the world having passed through so many vicissitudes.

 In the year 1850 the Greek and Latin monks residing in Jerusalem had a fierce dispute about the guardianship of what are called the “holy places.” In this dispute the emperor Nicholas of Russia sided with the Greeks, and Louis Napoleon, the emperor of the French, with the Latins. This led the Turkish authorities to settle the question in a way unsatisfactory to Russia. Out of this there sprang the Crimean War, which was protracted and sanguinary, but which had important consequences in the way of breaking down the barriers of Turkish exclusiveness.

 Modern Jerusalem “lies near the summit of a broad mountain-ridge, which extends without interruption from the plain of Esdraelon to a line drawn between the southern end of the Dead Sea and the southeastern corner of the Mediterranean.” This high, uneven table-land is everywhere from 20 to 25 geographical miles in breadth. It was anciently known as the mountains of Ephraim and Judah.

 “Jerusalem is a city of contrasts, and differs widely from Damascus, not merely because it is a stone town in mountains, whilst the latter is a mud city in a plain, but because while in Damascus Moslem religion and Oriental custom are unmixed with any foreign element, in Jerusalem every form of religion, every nationality of East and West, is represented at one time.”

 Jerusalem is first mentioned under that name in the Book of Joshua, and the Tell-el-Amarna collection of tablets includes six letters from its Amorite king to Egypt, recording the attack of the Abiri about B.C. 1480. The name is there spelt Uru-Salim (“city of peace”). Another monumental record in which the Holy City is named is that of Sennacherib’s attack in B.C. 702. The “camp of the Assyrians” was still shown about A.D. 70, on the flat ground to the north-west, included in the new quarter of the city.

 The city of David included both the upper city and Millo, and was surrounded by a wall built by David and Solomon, who appear to have restored the original Jebusite fortifications. The name Zion (or Sion) appears to have been, like Ariel (“the hearth of God”), a poetical term for Jerusalem, but in the Greek age was more specially used of the Temple hill. The priests’ quarter grew up on Ophel, south of the Temple, where also was Solomon’s Palace outside the original city of David. The walls of the city were extended by Jotham and Manasseh to include this suburb and the Temple ([2 Chr. 27:3](/2chr#2Chr.27.3); [33:14](/2chr#2Chr.33.14)).

 Jerusalem is now a town of some 50,000 inhabitants, with ancient mediaeval walls, partly on the old lines, but extending less far to the south. The traditional sites, as a rule, were first shown in the 4th and later centuries A.D., and have no authority. The results of excavation have, however, settled most of the disputed questions, the limits of the Temple area, and the course of the old walls having been traced.",http://dare.ht.lu.se/places/15896,31.776667,35.234167,"abijah_38,ahaz_118,ahaziah_121,amaziah_214,amon_236,asa_318,attai_365,azariah_381,eliada_1078,eliphalet_1143,elishua_1163,hezekiah_1512,ibhar_1584,japhia_728,jehiel_773,jehoahaz_2516,jehoiachin_791,jehoiakim_1085,jehoram_803,jehoshabeath_811,jehoshaphat_808,jerimoth_869,jeush_1603,joash_1632,johanan_1667,josiah_1730,jotham_1735,maachah_1841,mahalath_1888,manasseh_1930,michael_2066,naamah_2119,nathan_2152,nepheg_2179,nogah_2213,rehoboam_2412,shamariah_2531,shammua_2547,shelomith_2610,shephatiah_2660,shobab_2715,solomon_2762,tamar_2823,uzziah_375,zaham_2980,zechariah_3010,zedekiah_1950,ziza_3098","abijah_38,adonijah_97,ahaz_118,ahaziah_121,amaziah_214,amon_236,asa_318,athaliah_359,azariah_381,david_994,hezekiah_1512,jehiel_773,jehoiakim_1085,jehoram_803,jehoshaphat_808,jesus_905,joash_1632,josiah_1730,jotham_1735,manasseh_1930,michael_2066,rehoboam_2412,shephatiah_2660,solomon_2762,uzziah_375,zechariah_3010,stephen_2802",VERIFIED,"church-2,settlement,temple-2","Ierusalem/Hierosolyma/Col.

This name is in the original in the dual form, and means “possession of peace,” or “foundation of peace.” The dual form probably refers to the two mountains on which it was built, viz., Zion and Moriah; or, as some suppose, to the two parts of the city, the “upper” and the “lower city.” Jerusalem is a “mountain city enthroned on a mountain fastness” (comp. [Ps. 68:15](/ps#Ps.68.15), [16](/ps#Ps.68.16); 87:1; 125:2; 76:1, 2; 122:3). It stands on the edge of one of the highest table-lands in Palestine, and is surrounded on the south-eastern, the southern, and the western sides by deep and precipitous ravines.

 It is first mentioned in Scripture under the name Salem ([Gen. 14:18](/gen#Gen.14.18); comp. [Ps. 76:2](/ps#Ps.76.2)). When first mentioned under the name Jerusalem, Adonizedek was its king ([Josh. 10:1](/josh#Josh.10.1)). It is afterwards named among the cities of Benjamin ([Judg. 19:10](/judg#Judg.19.10); [1 Chr. 11:4](/1chr#1Chr.11.4)); but in the time of David it was divided between Benjamin and Judah. After the death of Joshua the city was taken and set on fire by the men of Judah ([Judg. 1:1-8](/judg#Judg.1.1)); but the Jebusites were not wholly driven out of it. The city is not again mentioned till we are told that David brought the head of Goliath thither ([1 Sam. 17:54](/1sam#1Sam.17.54)). David afterwards led his forces against the Jebusites still residing within its walls, and drove them out, fixing his own dwelling on Zion, which he called “the city of David” ([2 Sam. 5:5-9](/2sam#2Sam.5.5); [1 Chr. 11:4-8](/1chr#1Chr.11.4)). Here he built an altar to the Lord on the threshing-floor of Araunah the Jebusite ([2 Sam. 24:15-25](/2sam#2Sam.24.15)), and thither he brought up the ark of the covenant and placed it in the new tabernacle which he had prepared for it. Jerusalem now became the capital of the kingdom.

 After the death of David, Solomon built the temple, a house for the name of the Lord, on Mount Moriah (B.C. 1010). He also greatly strengthened and adorned the city, and it became the great centre of all the civil and religious affairs of the nation ([Deut. 12:5](/deut#Deut.12.5); comp. 12:14; 14:23; 16:11-16; [Ps. 122](/ps#Ps.122)).

 After the disruption of the kingdom on the accession to the throne of Rehoboam, the son of Solomon, Jerusalem became the capital of the kingdom of the two tribes. It was subsequently often taken and retaken by the Egyptians, the Assyrians, and by the kings of Israel ([2 Kings 14:13](/2kgs#2Kgs.14.13), [14](/2kgs#2Kgs.14.14); 18:15, 16; 23:33-35; 24:14; [2 Chr. 12:9](/2chr#2Chr.12.9); [26:9](/2chr#2Chr.26.9); [27:3](/2chr#2Chr.27.3), [4](/2chr#2Chr.27.4); [29:3](/2chr#2Chr.29.3); [32:30](/2chr#2Chr.32.30); [33:11](/2chr#2Chr.33.11)), till finally, for the abounding iniquities of the nation, after a siege of three years, it was taken and utterly destroyed, its walls razed to the ground, and its temple and palaces consumed by fire, by Nebuchadnezzar, the king of Babylon ([2 Kings 25](/2kgs#2Kgs.25); [2 Chr. 36](/2chr#2Chr.36); [Jer. 39](/jer#Jer.39)), B.C. 588. The desolation of the city and the land was completed by the retreat of the principal Jews into Egypt ([Jer. 40](/jer#Jer.40)-44), and by the final carrying captive into Babylon of all that still remained in the land (52:3), so that it was left without an inhabitant (B.C. 582). Compare the predictions, [Deut. 28](/deut#Deut.28); [Lev. 26:14-39](/lev#Lev.26.14).

 But the streets and walls of Jerusalem were again to be built, in troublous times ([Dan. 9:16](/dan#Dan.9.16), [19](/dan#Dan.9.19), [25](/dan#Dan.9.25)), after a captivity of seventy years. This restoration was begun B.C. 536, “in the first year of Cyrus” ([Ezra 1:2](/ezra#Ezra.1.2), [3](/ezra#Ezra.1.3), [5](/ezra#Ezra.1.5)-11). The Books of Ezra and Nehemiah contain the history of the re-building of the city and temple, and the restoration of the kingdom of the Jews, consisting of a portion of all the tribes. The kingdom thus constituted was for two centuries under the dominion of Persia, till B.C. 331; and thereafter, for about a century and a half, under the rulers of the Greek empire in Asia, till B.C. 167. For a century the Jews maintained their independence under native rulers, the Asmonean princes. At the close of this period they fell under the rule of Herod and of members of his family, but practically under Rome, till the time of the destruction of Jerusalem, A.D. 70. The city was then laid in ruins.

 The modern Jerusalem by-and-by began to be built over the immense beds of rubbish resulting from the overthrow of the ancient city; and whilst it occupies certainly the same site, there are no evidences that even the lines of its streets are now what they were in the ancient city. Till A.D. 131 the Jews who still lingered about Jerusalem quietly submitted to the Roman sway. But in that year the emperor (Hadrian), in order to hold them in subjection, rebuilt and fortified the city. The Jews, however, took possession of it, having risen under the leadership of one Bar-Chohaba (i.e., “the son of the star”) in revolt against the Romans. Some four years afterwards (A.D. 135), however, they were driven out of it with great slaughter, and the city was again destroyed; and over its ruins was built a Roman city called Aelia Capitolina, a name which it retained till it fell under the dominion of the Mohammedans, when it was called el-Khuds, i.e., “the holy.”

 In A.D. 326 Helena, mother of the emperor Constantine, made a pilgrimage to Jerusalem with the view of discovering the places mentioned in the life of our Lord. She caused a church to be built on what was then supposed to be the place of the nativity at Bethlehem. Constantine, animated by her example, searched for the holy sepulchre, and built over the supposed site a magnificent church, which was completed and dedicated A.D. 335. He relaxed the laws against the Jews till this time in force, and permitted them once a year to visit the city and wail over the desolation of “the holy and beautiful house.”

 In A.D. 614 the Persians, after defeating the Roman forces of the emperor Heraclius, took Jerusalem by storm, and retained it till A.D. 637, when it was taken by the Arabians under the Khalif Omar. It remained in their possession till it passed, in A.D. 960, under the dominion of the Fatimite khalifs of Egypt, and in A.D. 1073 under the Turcomans. In A.D. 1099 the crusader Godfrey of Bouillon took the city from the Moslems with great slaughter, and was elected king of Jerusalem. He converted the Mosque of Omar into a Christian cathedral. During the eighty-eight years which followed, many churches and convents were erected in the holy city. The Church of the Holy Sepulchre was rebuilt during this period, and it alone remains to this day. In A.D. 1187 the sultan Saladin wrested the city from the Christians. From that time to the present day, with few intervals, Jerusalem has remained in the hands of the Moslems. It has, however, during that period been again and again taken and retaken, demolished in great part and rebuilt, no city in the world having passed through so many vicissitudes.

 In the year 1850 the Greek and Latin monks residing in Jerusalem had a fierce dispute about the guardianship of what are called the “holy places.” In this dispute the emperor Nicholas of Russia sided with the Greeks, and Louis Napoleon, the emperor of the French, with the Latins. This led the Turkish authorities to settle the question in a way unsatisfactory to Russia. Out of this there sprang the Crimean War, which was protracted and sanguinary, but which had important consequences in the way of breaking down the barriers of Turkish exclusiveness.

 Modern Jerusalem “lies near the summit of a broad mountain-ridge, which extends without interruption from the plain of Esdraelon to a line drawn between the southern end of the Dead Sea and the southeastern corner of the Mediterranean.” This high, uneven table-land is everywhere from 20 to 25 geographical miles in breadth. It was anciently known as the mountains of Ephraim and Judah.

 “Jerusalem is a city of contrasts, and differs widely from Damascus, not merely because it is a stone town in mountains, whilst the latter is a mud city in a plain, but because while in Damascus Moslem religion and Oriental custom are unmixed with any foreign element, in Jerusalem every form of religion, every nationality of East and West, is represented at one time.”

 Jerusalem is first mentioned under that name in the Book of Joshua, and the Tell-el-Amarna collection of tablets includes six letters from its Amorite king to Egypt, recording the attack of the Abiri about B.C. 1480. The name is there spelt Uru-Salim (“city of peace”). Another monumental record in which the Holy City is named is that of Sennacherib’s attack in B.C. 702. The “camp of the Assyrians” was still shown about A.D. 70, on the flat ground to the north-west, included in the new quarter of the city.

It is one of the oldest towns in Asia. It was and still is the chief sea-port of Judea. It was never wrested from the Phoenicians. It became a Jewish town only in the second century B.C. It was from this port that Jonah “took ship to flee from the presence of the Lord” ([Jonah 1:3](/jonah#Jonah.1.3)). To this place also the wood cut in Lebanon by Hiram’s men for Solomon was brought in floats ([2 Chr. 2:16](/2chr#2Chr.2.16)); and here the material for the building of the second temple was also landed ([Ezra 3:7](/ezra#Ezra.3.7)). At Joppa, in the house of Simon the tanner, “by the sea-side,” Peter resided “many days,” and here, “on the house-top,” he had his “vision of tolerance” ([Acts 9:36-43](/acts#Acts.9.36)). It bears the modern name of Jaffa, and exibituds all the decrepitude and squalor of cities ruled over by the Turks. “Scarcely any other town has been so often overthrown, sacked, pillaged, burned, and rebuilt.” Its present population is said to be about 16,000. It was taken by the French under Napoleon in 1799, who gave orders for the massacre here of 4,000 prisoners. It is connected with Jerusalem by the only carriage road that exists in the country, and also by a railway completed in 1892. It is noticed on monuments B.C. 1600-1300, and was attacked by Sannacharib B.C. 702.",http://dare.ht.lu.se/places/21683,32.053722,34.752119,,,VERIFIED,"settlement,port","Ioppe|Ioppe, Jaffa",6e884a2c-ffd5-44c3-a3c2-c66758f8af56,,"Peter heals Aeneas and Dorcas,Peter meets Cornelius","Peter and Cornelius, Peter and Cornelius","peter_2745, cornelius_956, simon_2753, dorcas_2810, aeneas_106",32.053722,34.752119,J,joppa_652

It joins the main stream about a mile below the junction of the Leddan and the Banias. The river thus formed is at this point about 45 feet wide, and flows in a channel from 12 to 20 feet below the plain. After this it flows, “with a swift current and a much-twisted course,” through a marshy plain for some 6 miles, when it falls into the Lake Huleh, “the waters of Merom” (q.v.).

 During this part of its course the Jordan has descended about 1,100 feet. At Banias it is 1,080 feet above sea-level. Flowing from the southern extremity of Lake Huleh, here almost on a level with the sea, it flows for 2 miles “through a waste of islets and papyrus,” and then for 9 miles through a narrow gorge in a foaming torrent onward to the Sea of Galilee (q.v.).

 “In the whole valley of the Jordan from the Lake Huleh to the Sea of Galilee there is not a single settled inhabitant. Along the whole eastern bank of the river and the lakes, from the base of Hermon to the ravine of Hieromax, a region of great fertility, 30 miles long by 7 or 8 wide, there are only some three inhabited villages. The western bank is almost as desolate. Ruins are numerous enough. Every mile or two is an old site of town or village, now well nigh hid beneath a dense jungle of thorns and thistles. The words of Scripture here recur to us with peculiar force: ‘I will make your cities waste, and bring your sanctuaries unto desolation...And I will bring the land into desolation: and your enemies which dwell therein shall be astonished at it...And your land shall be desolate, and your cities waste. Then shall the land enjoy her sabbaths, as long as it lieth desolate’ ([Lev. 26:31-34](/lev#Lev.26.31)).”, Dr. Porter’s Handbook.

 From the Sea of Galilee, at the level of 682 feet below the Mediterranean, the river flows through a long, low plain called “the region of Jordan” ([Matt. 3:5](/matt#Matt.3.5)), and by the modern Arabs the Ghor, or “sunken plain.” This section is properly the Jordan of Scripture. Down through the midst of the “plain of Jordan” there winds a ravine varying in breadth from 200 yards to half a mile, and in depth from 40 to 150 feet. Through it the Jordan flows in a rapid, rugged, tortuous course down to the Dead Sea. The whole distance from the southern extremity of the Sea of Galilee to the Dead Sea is in a straight line about 65 miles, but following the windings of the river about 200 miles, during which it falls 618 feet. The total length of the Jordan from Banias is about 104 miles in a straight line, during which it falls 2,380 feet.

 There are two considerable affluents which enter the river between the Sea of Galilee and the Dead Sea, both from the east.",http://pleiades.stoa.org/places/687932,33.1864496,35.6191595,,,VERIFIED,river,Iordanes (river),d4b48dc9-d32e-44da-a94f-d1dc92a14c6d,,,,,33.1864496,35.6191595,J,jordan_653

After examining it in all its districts, the spies brought back an evil report, Joshua and Caleb alone giving a good report of the land (13:18-31). Influenced by the discouraging report, the people abandoned all hope of entering into the Promised Land. They remained a considerable time at Kadesh. Because of their unbelief, they were condemned by God to wander for thirty-eight years in the wilderness. They took their journey from Kadesh into the deserts of Paran, “by way of the Red Sea” ([Deut. 2:1](/deut#Deut.2.1)). (One theory is that during these thirty-eight years they remained in and about Kadesh.)

 At the end of these years of wanderings, the tribes were a second time gathered together at Kadesh. During their stay here at this time Miriam died and was buried. Here the people murmured for want of water, as their forefathers had done formerly at Rephidim; and Moses, irritated by their chidings, “with his rod smote the rock twice,” instead of “speaking to the rock before their eyes,” as the Lord had commanded him (comp.

The king of Edom would not permit them to pass on through his territory, and therefore they commenced an eastward march, and “came unto Mount Hor” (20:22).

Here the people murmured for want of water, as their forefathers had done formerly at Rephidim; and Moses, irritated by their chidings, “with his rod smote the rock twice,” instead of “speaking to the rock before their eyes,” as the Lord had commanded him (comp. [Num. 27:14](/num#Num.27.14); [Deut. 9:23](/deut#Deut.9.23); [Ps. 106:32](/ps#Ps.106.32), [33](/ps#Ps.106.33)). Because of this act of his, in which Aaron too was involved, neither of them was to be permitted to set foot within the Promised Land ([Num. 20:12](/num#Num.20.12), [24](/num#Num.20.24)). The king of Edom would not permit them to pass on through his territory, and therefore they commenced an eastward march, and “came unto Mount Hor” (20:22).

Then a disgust fell on the multitude at having nothing to eat but the manna day after day, no change, no flesh, no fish, no high-flavoured vegetables, no luscious fruits...The people loathed the ‘light food,’ and cried out to Moses, ‘Give us flesh, give us flesh, that we may eat.’” In this emergency Moses, in despair, cried unto God. An answer came. God sent “a prodigious flight of quails, on which the people satiated their gluttonous appetite for a full month. Then punishment fell on them: they loathed the food which they had desired; it bred disease in them; the divine anger aggravated the disease into a plague, and a heavy mortality was the consequence. The dead were buried without the camp; and in memory of man’s sin and of the divine wrath this name, Kibroth-hattaavah, the Graves of Lust, was given to the place of their sepulchre” ([Num. 11:34](/num#Num.11.34), [35](/num#Num.11.35); 33:16, 17; [Deut. 9:22](/deut#Deut.9.22); comp.

This valley is known in Scripture only by the name “the brook Kidron.” David crossed this brook bare-foot and weeping, when fleeing from Absalom ([2 Sam. 15:23](/2sam#2Sam.15.23), [30](/2sam#2Sam.15.30)), and it was frequently crossed by our Lord in his journeyings to and fro ([John 18:1](/john#John.18.1)). Here Asa burned the obscene idols of his mother ([1 Kings 15:13](/1kgs#1Kgs.15.13)), and here Athaliah was executed ([2 Kings 11:16](/2kgs#2Kgs.11.16)). It afterwards became the receptacle for all manner of impurities ([2 Chr. 29:16](/2chr#2Chr.29.16); [30:14](/2chr#2Chr.30.14)); and in the time of Josiah this valley was the common cemetery of the city ([2 Kings 23:6](/2kgs#2Kgs.23.6); comp. [Jer. 26:23](/jer#Jer.26.23)).

 Through this mountain ravine no water runs, except after heavy rains in the mountains round about Jerusalem. Its length from its head to en-Rogel is 2 3/4 miles. Its precipitous, rocky banks are filled with ancient tombs, especially the left bank opposite the temple area. The greatest desire of the Jews is to be buried there, from the idea that the Kidron is the “valley of Jehoshaphat” mentioned in [Joel 3:2](/joel#Joel.3.2).

 Below en-Rogel the Kidron has no historical or sacred interest. It runs in a winding course through the wilderness of Judea to the north-western shore of the Dead Sea. Its whole length, in a straight line, is only some 20 miles, but in this space its descent is about 3,912 feet.

 Recent excavations have brought to light the fact that the old bed of the Kidron is about 40 feet lower than its present bed, and about 70 feet nearer the sanctuary wall.",http://dare.ht.lu.se/places/28349,31.826142,34.775865,,,VERIFIED,settlement,"Gedros|Gedros, Qatra",95385519-4eae-4569-b2f5-1d1121344cd2,,,,,31.826142,34.775865,K,kidron_687

After the death of Ahab, Mesha, king of Moab, threw off allegiance to the king of Israel, and fought successfully for the independence of his kingdom. After this Jehoram, king of Israel, in seeking to regain his supremacy over Moab, entered into an alliance with Jehoshaphat, king of Judah, and with the king of Edom. The three kings led their armies against Mesha, who was driven back to seek refuge in Kir-haraseth. The Moabites were driven to despair. Mesha then took his eldest son, who would have reigned in his stead, and offered him as a burnt-offering on the wall of the fortress in the sight of the allied armies. “There was great indignation against Israel: and they departed from him, and returned to their own land.” The invaders evacuated the land of Moab, and Mesha achieved the independence of his country ([2 Kings 3:20-27](/2kgs#2Kgs.3.20)).",,,,,,UNVERIFIED,,,e56d4c5f-8898-4aa0-a663-48a393509c6b,,,,,31.1813258,35.70214779,K,kir-hareseth_694

An account of this siege is given on some slabs found in the chambers of the palace of Koyunjik, and now in the British Museum. The inscription has been deciphered as follows:, “Sennacherib, the mighty king, king of the country of Assyria, sitting on the throne of judgment before the city of Lachish: I gave permission for its slaughter.”

 Lachish has been identified with Tell-el-Hesy, where a cuneiform tablet has been found, containing a letter supposed to be from Amenophis at Amarna in reply to one of the Amarna tablets sent by Zimrida from Lachish. This letter is from the chief of Atim (=Etam, [1 Chr. 4:32](/1chr#1Chr.4.32)) to the chief of Lachish, in which the writer expresses great alarm at the approach of marauders from the Hebron hills. “They have entered the land,” he says, “to lay waste...strong is he who has come down. He lays waste.” This letter shows that “the communication by tablets in cuneiform script was not only usual in writing to Egypt, but in the internal correspondence of the country. The letter, though not so important in some ways as the Moabite stone and the Siloam text, is one of the most valuable discoveries ever made in Palestine” (Conder’s Tell Amarna Tablets, p. 134).

 Excavations at Lachish are still going on, and among other discoveries is that of an iron blast-furnace, with slag and ashes, which is supposed to have existed B.C. 1500. If the theories of experts are correct, the use of the hot-air blast instead of cold air (an improvement in iron manufacture patented by Neilson in 1828) was known fifteen hundred years before Christ.",http://dare.ht.lu.se/places/28359,31.56522,34.84907,,,VERIFIED,settlement,"Lachish|Lachish, Tell ed-Duwer",bfb3e5a0-4e5c-4b20-815b-56407f3b229c,,,,,31.56522,34.84907,L,lachish_711

It is a branch running southward from the Caucasus, and at its lower end forking into two parallel ranges, the eastern or Anti-Lebanon, and the western or Lebanon proper. They enclose a long valley ([Josh. 11:17](/josh#Josh.11.17)) of from 5 to 8 miles in width, called by Roman writers Coele-Syria, now called el-Buka’a, “the valley,” a prolongation of the valley of the Jordan.

 Lebanon proper, Jebel es-Sharki, commences at its southern extremity in the gorge of the Leontes, the ancient Litany, and extends north-east, parallel to the Mediterranean coast, as far as the river Eleutherus, at the plain of Emesa, “the entering of Hamath” ([Num. 34:8](/num#Num.34.8); [1 Kings 8:65](/1kgs#1Kgs.8.65)), in all about 90 geographical miles in extent. The average height of this range is from 6,000 to 8,000 feet; the peak of Jebel Mukhmel is about 10,200 feet, and the Sannin about 9,000. The highest peaks are covered with perpetual snow and ice.

It was governed by a propraetor with the title of proconsul. Paul was summoned by the vision of the “man of Macedonia” to preach the gospel there ([Acts 16:9](/acts#Acts.16.9)). Frequent allusion is made to this event (18:5; 19:21; [Rom. 15:26](/rom#Rom.15.26); [2 Cor. 1:16](/2cor#2Cor.1.16); [11:9](/2cor#2Cor.11.9); [Phil. 4:15](/phil#Phil.4.15)). The history of Paul’s first journey through Macedonia is given in detail in [Acts 16:10-17:15](/acts#Acts.16.10). At the close of this journey he returned from Corinth to Syria. He again passed through this country (20:1-6), although the details of the route are not given. After many years he probably visited it for a third time ([Phil. 2:24](/phil#Phil.2.24); [1 Tim. 1:3](/1tim#1Tim.1.3)).

It is one of those Bible localities about the identification of which there can be no doubt. It was on the slope of a hill on the east of Hebron, “before Mamre.” Here were laid the bodies of Abraham and Sarah, Isaac and Rebekah, Jacob and Leah ([Gen. 23:19](/gen#Gen.23.19); [25:9](/gen#Gen.25.9); [49:31](/gen#Gen.49.31); [50:13](/gen#Gen.50.13)). Over the cave an ancient Christian church was erected, probably in the time of Justinian, the Roman emperor. This church has been converted into a Mohammedan mosque. The whole is surrounded by the el-Haram i.e., “the sacred enclosure,” about 200 feet long, 115 broad, and of an average height of about 50. This building, from the immense size of some of its stones, and the manner in which they are fitted together, is supposed by some to have been erected in the days of David or of Solomon, while others ascribe it to the time of Herod. It is looked upon as the most ancient and finest relic of Jewish architecture.

 On the floor of the mosque are erected six large cenotaphs as monuments to the dead who are buried in the cave beneath. Between the cenotaphs of Isaac and Rebekah there is a circular opening in the floor into the cavern below, the cave of Machpelah. Here it may be that the body of Jacob, which was embalmed in Egypt, is still preserved (much older embalmed bodies have recently been found in the cave of Deir el-Bahari in Egypt), though those of the others there buried may have long ago mouldered into dust. The interior of the mosque was visited by the Prince of Wales in 1862 by a special favour of the Mohammedan authorities. An interesting account of this visit is given in Dean Stanley’s Lectures on the Jewish Church. It was also visited in 1866 by the Marquis of Bute, and in 1869 by the late Emperor (Frederick) of Germany, then the Crown Prince of Prussia. In 1881 it was visited by the two sons of the Prince of Wales, accompanied by Sir C.

This name was afterwards given to the town which was built at that place. It was the southern boundary of Bashan ([Josh. 13:26](/josh#Josh.13.26), [30](/josh#Josh.13.30)), and became a city of the Levites (21:38). Here Saul’s son Ishbosheth reigned ([2 Sam. 2:8](/2sam#2Sam.2.8), [12](/2sam#2Sam.2.12)), while David reigned at Hebron. Here also, after a troubled reign, Ishbosheth was murdered by two of his own bodyguard ([2 Sam. 4:5-7](/2sam#2Sam.4.5)), who brought his head to David at Hebron, but were, instead of being rewarded, put to death by him for their cold-blooded murder. Many years after this, when he fled from Jerusalem on the rebellion of his son Absalom, David made Mahanaim, where Barzillai entertained him, his headquarters, and here he mustered his forces which were led against the army that had gathered around Absalom. It was while sitting at the gate of this town that tidings of the great and decisive battle between the two hosts and of the death of his son Absalom reached him, when he gave way to the most violent grief ([2 Sam. 17:24-27](/2sam#2Sam.17.24)).

 We first hear of this people in the Assyrian cuneiform records, under the name of Amada, about B.C. 840. They appear to have been a branch of the Aryans, who came from the east bank of the Indus, and were probably the predominant race for a while in the Mesopotamian valley. They consisted for three or four centuries of a number of tribes, each ruled by its own chief, who at length were brought under the Assyrian yoke ([2 Kings 17:6](/2kgs#2Kgs.17.6)). From this subjection they achieved deliverance, and formed themselves into an empire under Cyaxares (B.C. 633). This monarch entered into an alliance with the king of Babylon, and invaded Assyria, capturing and destroying the city of Nineveh (B.C. 625), thus putting an end to the Assyrian monarchy ([Nah. 1:8](/nah#Nah.1.8); [2:5](/nah#Nah.2.5), [6](/nah#Nah.2.6); [3:13](/nah#Nah.3.13), [14](/nah#Nah.3.14)).

 Media now rose to a place of great power, vastly extending its boundaries. But it did not long exist as an independent kingdom. It rose with Cyaxares, its first king, and it passed away with him; for during the reign of his son and successor Astyages, the Persians waged war against the Medes and conquered them, the two nations being united under one monarch, Cyrus the Persian (B.C. 558).

 The “cities of the Medes” are first mentioned in connection with the deportation of the Israelites on the destruction of Samaria ([2 Kings 17:6](/2kgs#2Kgs.17.6); [18:11](/2kgs#2Kgs.18.11)). Soon afterwards Isaiah (13:17; 21:2) speaks of the part taken by the Medes in the destruction of Babylon (comp. [Jer. 51:11](/jer#Jer.51.11), [28](/jer#Jer.51.28)). Daniel gives an account of the reign of Darius the Mede, who was made viceroy by Cyrus ([Dan. 6:1-28](/dan#Dan.6.1)). The decree of Cyrus, Ezra informs us (6:2-5), was found in “the palace that is in the province of the Medes,” Achmetha or Ecbatana of the Greeks, which is the only Median city mentioned in Scripture.",http://pleiades.stoa.org/places/903080,34.5,46.5,,,VERIFIED,region,Media/Mad(aya),8fc67902-e884-4cce-a7d2-b20436ef782e,,,,,34.5,46.5,M,media_776

 The valley or plain of Megiddo was part of the plain of Esdraelon, the great battle-field of Palestine. It was here Barak gained a notable victory over Jabin, the king of Hazor, whose general, Sisera, led on the hostile army. Barak rallied the warriors of the northern tribes, and under the encouragement of Deborah (q.v.), the prophetess, attacked the Canaanites in the great plain. The army of Sisera was thrown into complete confusion, and was engulfed in the waters of the Kishon, which had risen and overflowed its banks ([Judg. 4:5](/judg#Judg.4.5)).

 Many years after this (B.C. 610), Pharaohnecho II., on his march against the king of Assyria, passed through the plains of Philistia and Sharon; and King Josiah, attempting to bar his progress in the plain of Megiddo, was defeated by the Egyptians. He was wounded in battle, and died as they bore him away in his chariot towards Jerusalem ([2 Kings 23:29](/2kgs#2Kgs.23.29); [2 Chr. 35:22-24](/2chr#2Chr.35.22)), and all Israel mourned for him. So general and bitter was this mourning that it became a proverb, to which Zechariah (12:11, 12) alludes. Megiddo has been identified with the modern el-Lejjun, at the head of the Kishon, under the north-eastern brow of Carmel, on the south-western edge of the plain of Esdraelon, and 9 miles west of Jezreel. Others identify it with Mujedd’a, 4 miles south-west of Bethshean, but the question of its site is still undetermined.",http://dare.ht.lu.se/places/21660,32.58505,35.18452,,,VERIFIED,settlement,"Legio/Caporcotani/Maximianopolis|Legio/Caporcotani/Maximianopolis, Tel Megiddo",4732ccfd-01bb-4c97-ba9e-48d41723dc2d,,,,,32.58505,35.18452,M,megiddo_777

It was originally colonized by Phoenicians (“barbarians,” 28:2). It came into the possession of the Greeks (B.C. 736), from whom it was taken by the Carthaginians (B.C. 528). In B.C. 242 it was conquered by the Romans, and was governed by a Roman propraetor at the time of the shipwreck ([Acts 28:7](/acts#Acts.28.7)). Since 1800, when the French garrison surrendered to the English force, it has been a British dependency. The island is about 17 miles long and 9 wide, and about 60 in circumference. After a stay of three months on this island, during which the “barbarians” showed them no little kindness, Julius procured for himself and his company a passage in another Alexandrian corn-ship which had wintered in the island, in which they proceeded on their voyage to Rome ([Acts 28:13](/acts#Acts.28.13), [14](/acts#Acts.28.14)).",http://dare.ht.lu.se/places/25440,35.87373581,14.44874427,,,VERIFIED,"villa,unknown,sanctuary,island,settlement","Gaulos|Melita|Melita/Malta (island)|Melita/Malta, Malta|Melita, Mdina, Rabat|Tas-Silġ|Tas-Silġ|Gaulos, Victoria",42873f63-320d-4701-b083-888732077792,,Paul stays at Malta,Journey to Rome,"paul_2479, aristarchus_306, julius_1763, publius_2374",35.87373581,14.44874427,M,melita_761

From this place, in compliance with the desire of the people, Moses sent forth “twelve spies” to spy the land. After examining it in all its districts, the spies brought back an evil report, Joshua and Caleb alone giving a good report of the land (13:18-31). Influenced by the discouraging report, the people abandoned all hope of entering into the Promised Land. They remained a considerable time at Kadesh. Because of their unbelief, they were condemned by God to wander for thirty-eight years in the wilderness. They took their journey from Kadesh into the deserts of Paran, “by way of the Red Sea” ([Deut. 2:1](/deut#Deut.2.1)). (One theory is that during these thirty-eight years they remained in and about Kadesh.)

 At the end of these years of wanderings, the tribes were a second time gathered together at Kadesh. During their stay here at this time Miriam died and was buried. Here the people murmured for want of water, as their forefathers had done formerly at Rephidim; and Moses, irritated by their chidings, “with his rod smote the rock twice,” instead of “speaking to the rock before their eyes,” as the Lord had commanded him (comp. [Num. 27:14](/num#Num.27.14); [Deut. 9:23](/deut#Deut.9.23); [Ps. 106:32](/ps#Ps.106.32), [33](/ps#Ps.106.33)). Because of this act of his, in which Aaron too was involved, neither of them was to be permitted to set foot within the Promised Land ([Num. 20:12](/num#Num.20.12), [24](/num#Num.20.24)). The king of Edom would not permit them to pass on through his territory, and therefore they commenced an eastward march, and “came unto Mount Hor” (20:22).

They inhabited principally the desert north of the peninsula of Arabia. The peninsula of Sinai was the pasture-ground for their flocks. They were virtually the rulers of Arabia, being the dominant tribe. Like all Arabians, they were a nomad people. They early engaged in commercial pursuits. It was to one of their caravans that Joseph was sold ([Gen. 37:28](/gen#Gen.37.28), [36](/gen#Gen.37.36)). The next notice of them is in connection with Moses’ flight from Egypt ([Ex. 2:15-21](/exod#Exod.2.15)). Here in Midian Moses became the servant and afterwards the son-in-law of Reuel or Jethro, the priest. After the Exodus, the Midianites were friendly to the Israelites so long as they traversed only their outlying pasture-ground on the west of the Arabah; but when, having passed the southern end of Edom, they entered into the land of Midian proper, they joined with Balak, the king of Moab, in a conspiracy against them ([Num. 22:4-7](/num#Num.22.4)). Balaam, who had been sent for to curse Israel, having utterly failed to do so, was dismissed by the king of Moab; nevertheless he still tarried among the Midianites, and induced them to enter into correspondence with the Israelites, so as to bring them into association with them in the licentious orgies connected with the worship of Baal-Peor. This crafty counsel prevailed. The Israelites took part in the heathen festival, and so brought upon themselves a curse indeed. Their apostasy brought upon them a severe punishment. A plague broke out amongst them, and more than twenty-four thousand of the people perished ([Num. 25:9](/num#Num.25.9)). But the Midianites were not to be left unpunished. A terrible vengeance was denounced against them. A thousand warriors from each tribe, under the leadership of Phinehas, went forth against them. The Midianites were utterly routed. Their cities were consumed by fire, five of their kings were put to death, and the whole nation was destroyed ([Josh. 13:21](/josh#Josh.13.21), [22](/josh#Josh.13.22)). Balaam also perished by the sword, receiving the “wages of his unrighteousness” ([Num. 31:8](/num#Num.31.8); 2 Pet. 2:15). The whole of the country on the east of Jordan, now conquered by the Israelites (see SIHON;  OG), was divided between the two tribes of Reuben and Gad and the half tribe of Manasseh.

 Some two hundred and fifty years after this the Midianites had regained their ancient power, and in confederation with the Amalekites and the “children of the east” they made war against their old enemies the Israelites, whom for seven years they oppressed and held in subjection. They were at length assailed by Gideon in that ever-memorable battle in the great plain of Esdraelon, and utterly destroyed ([Judg. 6:1](/judg#Judg.6.1)-ch. 7). Frequent allusions are afterwards made to this great victory ([Ps. 83:10](/ps#Ps.83.10), [12](/ps#Ps.83.12); [Isa. 9:4](/isa#Isa.9.4); [10:6](/isa#Isa.10.6)).

It was some 4 miles north-west of Jerusalem, and was situated on the loftiest hill in the neighbourhood, some 600 feet above the plain of Gibeon. This village has the modern name of Neby Samwil, i.e., the prophet Samuel, from a tradition that Samuel’s tomb is here.

 Samuel inaugurated the reformation that characterized his time by convening a great assembly of all Israel at Mizpeh, now the politico-religious centre of the nation. There, in deep humiliation on account of their sins, they renewed their vows and entered again into covenant with the God of their fathers. It was a period of great religious awakening and of revived national life. The Philistines heard of this assembly, and came up against Israel. The Hebrews charged the Philistine host with great fury, and they were totally routed. Samuel commemorated this signal victory by erecting a memorial-stone, which he called “Ebenezer” (q.v.), saying, “Hitherto hath the Lord helped us” ([1 Sam. 7:7-12](/1sam#1Sam.7.7)).",,,,,,NOT_IDENTIFIABLE,,,a423a3ae-e90f-40b9-a1c7-d58244617e2a,,,,,31.83273947,35.18016286,M,mizpah_811

It was on the left of the valley containing the ancient town of Shechem (q.v.), on the way to Jerusalem. It stood over against Mount Ebal, the summits of these mountains being distant from each other about 2 miles ([Deut. 27](/deut#Deut.27); [Josh. 8:30-35](/josh#Josh.8.30)). On the slopes of this mountain the tribes descended from the handmaids of Leah and Rachel, together with the tribe of Reuben, were gathered together, and gave the responses to the blessing pronounced as the reward of obedience, when Joshua in the valley below read the whole law in the hearing of all the people; as those gathered on Ebal responded with a loud Amen to the rehearsal of the curses pronounced on the disobedient. It was probably at this time that the coffin containing the embalmed body of Joseph was laid in the “parcel of ground which Jacob bought of the sons of Hamor” ([Gen. 33:19](/gen#Gen.33.19); [50:25](/gen#Gen.50.25)).

 Josephus relates (Ant. 11:8, 2-4) that Sanballat built a temple for the Samaritans on this mountain, and instituted a priesthood, as rivals to those of the Jews at Jerusalem. This temple was destroyed after it had stood two hundred years. It was afterwards rebuilt by Herod the Great. There is a Samaritan tradition that it was the scene of the incident recorded in [Gen. 22](/gen#Gen.22). There are many ruins on this mountain, some of which are evidently of Christian buildings. To this mountain the woman of Sychar referred in [John 4:20](/john#John.4.20). For centuries Gerizim was the centre of political outbreaks.

From Rephidim ([Ex. 17:8-13](/exod#Exod.17.8)) the Israelites journeyed forward through the Wady Solaf and Wady esh-Sheikh into the plain of er-Rahah, “the desert of Sinai,” about 2 miles long and half a mile broad, and encamped there “before the mountain.” The part of the mountain range, a protruding lower bluff, known as the Ras Sasafeh (Sufsafeh), rises almost perpendicularly from this plain, and is in all probability the Sinai of history. Dean Stanley thus describes the scene:, “The plain itself is not broken and uneven and narrowly shut in, like almost all others in the range, but presents a long retiring sweep, within which the people could remove and stand afar off. The cliff, rising like a huge altar in front of the whole congregation, and visible against the sky in lonely grandeur from end to end of the whole plain, is the very image of the ‘mount that might be touched,’ and from which the voice of God might be heard far and wide over the plain below.” This was the scene of the giving of the law. From the Ras Sufsafeh the law was proclaimed to the people encamped below in the plain of er-Rahah. During the lengthened period of their encampment here the Israelites passed through a very memorable experience. An immense change passed over them. They are now an organized nation, bound by covenant engagement to serve the Lord their God, their ever-present divine Leader and Protector. At length, in the second month of the second year of the Exodus, they move their camp and march forward according to a prescribed order. After three days they reach the “wilderness of Paran,” the “et-Tih”, i.e., “the desert”, and here they make their first encampment. At this time a spirit of discontent broke out amongst them, and the Lord manifested his displeasure by a fire which fell on the encampment and inflicted injury on them. Moses called the place Taberah (q.v.), [Num. 11:1-3](/num#Num.11.1). The journey between Sinai and the southern boundary of the Promised Land (about 150 miles) at Kadesh was accomplished in about a year.",http://pleiades.stoa.org/places/746815,28.58771,33.921682,,,VERIFIED,mountain,Syna M.,afbc6dc0-1174-4140-9220-34e163336818,,,,,28.58771,33.921682,M,mount_sinai_855

 This city is not mentioned in the Old Testament. It was the home of Joseph and Mary ([Luke 2:39](/luke#Luke.2.39)), and here the angel announced to the Virgin the birth of the Messiah (1:26-28). Here Jesus grew up from his infancy to manhood (4:16); and here he began his public ministry in the synagogue ([Matt. 13:54](/matt#Matt.13.54)), at which the people were so offended that they sought to cast him down from the precipice whereon their city was built ([Luke 4:29](/luke#Luke.4.29)). Twice they expelled him from their borders (4:16-29; [Matt. 13:54-58](/matt#Matt.13.54)); and he finally retired from the city, where he did not many mighty works because of their unbelief ([Matt. 13:58](/matt#Matt.13.58)), and took up his residence in Capernaum.

 Nazareth is situated among the southern ridges of Lebanon, on the steep slope of a hill, about 14 miles from the Sea of Galilee and about 6 west from Mount Tabor. It is identified with the modern village en-Nazirah, of six or ten thousand inhabitants. It lies “as in a hollow cup” lower down upon the hill than the ancient city. The main road for traffic between Egypt and the interior of Asia passed by Nazareth near the foot of Tabor, and thence northward to Damascus.

 It is supposed from the words of Nathanael in [John 1:46](/john#John.1.46) that the city of Nazareth was held in great disrepute, either because, it is said, the people of Galilee were a rude and less cultivated class, and were largely influenced by the Gentiles who mingled with them, or because of their lower type of moral and religious character. But there seems to be no sufficient reason for these suppositions. The Jews believed that, according to [Micah 5:2](/mic#Mic.5.2), the birth of the Messiah would take place at Bethlehem, and nowhere else. Nathanael held the same opinion as his countrymen, and believed that the great “good” which they were all expecting could not come from Nazareth. This is probably what Nathanael meant. Moreover, there does not seem to be any evidence that the inhabitants of Galilee were in any respect inferior, or that a Galilean was held in contempt, in the time of our Lord.

 The population of this city (now about 10,000) in the time of Christ probably amounted to 15,000 or 20,000 souls.

 “The so-called ‘Holy House’ is a cave under the Latin church, which appears to have been originally a tank. The ‘brow of the hill’, site of the attempted precipitation, is probably the northern cliff: the traditional site has been shown since the middle ages at some distance to the south. None of the traditional sites are traceable very early, and they have no authority. The name Nazareth perhaps means ‘a watch tower’ (now en-Nasrah), but is connected in the New Testament with Netzer, ’a branch’ ([Isa. 4:2](/isa#Isa.4.2); [Jer. 23:5](/jer#Jer.23.5); [Zech. 3:8](/zech#Zech.3.8); [6:12](/zech#Zech.6.12); [Matt. 2:23](/matt#Matt.2.23)), Nazarene being quite a different word from Nazarite.”",http://dare.ht.lu.se/places/22899,32.701029,35.300148,,,VERIFIED,settlement,"Nazareth|Nazareth, Nazareth",1f7f2866-4113-4a79-85aa-9812b95aa99b,,,,,32.701029,35.300148,N,nazareth_878

The book of the prophet Nahum is almost exclusively taken up with prophetic denunciations against this city. Its ruin and utter desolation are foretold ([Nah. 1:14](/nah#Nah.1.14); [3:19](/nah#Nah.3.19), etc.). Zephaniah also (2:13-15) predicts its destruction along with the fall of the empire of which it was the capital. From this time there is no mention of it in Scripture till it is named in gospel history ([Matt. 12:41](/matt#Matt.12.41); [Luke 11:32](/luke#Luke.11.32)).

 This “exceeding great city” lay on the eastern or left bank of the river Tigris, along which it stretched for some 30 miles, having an average breadth of 10 miles or more from the river back toward the eastern hills. This whole extensive space is now one immense area of ruins. Occupying a central position on the great highway between the Mediterranean and the Indian Ocean, thus uniting the East and the West, wealth flowed into it from many sources, so that it became the greatest of all ancient cities.

 About B.C. 633 the Assyrian empire began to show signs of weakness, and Nineveh was attacked by the Medes, who subsequently, about B.C. 625, being joined by the Babylonians and Susianians, again attacked it, when it fell, and was razed to the ground. The Assyrian empire then came to an end, the Medes and Babylonians dividing its provinces between them. “After having ruled for more than six hundred years with hideous tyranny and violence, from the Caucasus and the Caspian to the Persian Gulf, and from beyond the Tigris to Asia Minor and Egypt, it vanished like a dream” ([Nah. 2:6-11](/nah#Nah.2.6)). Its end was strange, sudden, tragic. It was God’s doing, his judgement on Assyria’s pride ([Isa. 10:5-19](/isa#Isa.10.5)).

 Forty years ago our knowledge of the great Assyrian empire and of its magnificent capital was almost wholly a blank. Vague memories had indeed survived of its power and greatness, but very little was definitely known about it. Other cities which had perished, as Palmyra, Persepolis, and Thebes, had left ruins to mark their sites and tell of their former greatness; but of this city, imperial Nineveh, not a single vestige seemed to remain, and the very place on which it had stood was only matter of conjecture. In fulfilment of prophecy, God made “an utter end of the place.” It became a “desolation.”

 In the days of the Greek historian Herodotus, B.C. 400, it had become a thing of the past; and when Xenophon the historian passed the place in the “Retreat of the Ten Thousand,” the very memory of its name had been lost. It was buried out of sight, and no one knew its grave. It is never again to rise from its ruins.

 At length, after being lost for more than two thousand years, the city was disentombed. A little more than forty years ago the French consul at Mosul began to search the vast mounds that lay along the opposite bank of the river. The Arabs whom he employed in these excavations, to their great surprise, came upon the ruins of a building at the mound of Khorsabad, which, on further exploration, turned out to be the royal palace of Sargon, one of the Assyrian kings. They found their way into its extensive courts and chambers, and brought forth form its hidded depths many wonderful sculptures and other relics of those ancient times.

 The work of exploration has been carried on almost continuously by M. Botta, Sir Henry Layard, George Smith, and others, in the mounds of Nebi-Yunus, Nimrud, Koyunjik, and Khorsabad, and a vast treasury of specimens of old Assyrian art has been exhumed. Palace after palace has been discovered, with their decorations and their sculptured slabs, revealing the life and manners of this ancient people, their arts of war and peace, the forms of their religion, the style of their architecture, and the magnificence of their monarchs. The streets of the city have been explored, the inscriptions on the bricks and tablets and sculptured figures have been read, and now the secrets of their history have been brought to light.

 One of the most remarkable of recent discoveries is that of the library of King Assur-bani-pal, or, as the Greek historians call him, Sardanapalos, the grandson of Sennacherib (q.v.). This library consists of about ten thousand flat bricks or tablets, all written over with Assyrian characters. They contain a record of the history, the laws, and the religion of Assyria, of the greatest value. These strange clay leaves found in the royal library form the most valuable of all the treasuries of the literature of the old world. The library contains also old Accadian documents, which are the oldest extant documents in the world, dating as far back as probably about the time of Abraham.

 “The Assyrian royalty is, perhaps, the most luxurious of our century [reign of Assur-bani-pa]...Its victories and conquests, uninterrupted for one hundred years, have enriched it with the spoil of twenty peoples. Sargon has taken what remained to the Hittites; Sennacherib overcame Chaldea, and the treasures of Babylon were transferred to his coffers; Esarhaddon and Assur-bani-pal himself have pillaged Egypt and her great cities, Sais, Memphis, and Thebes of the hundred gates...Now foreign merchants flock into Nineveh, bringing with them the most valuable productions from all countries, gold and perfume from South Arabia and the Chaldean Sea, Egyptian linen and glass-work, carved enamels, goldsmiths’ work, tin, silver, Phoenician purple; cedar wood from Lebanon, unassailable by worms; furs and iron from Asia Minor and Armenia” (Ancient Egypt and Assyria, by G. Maspero, page 271).

 The bas-reliefs, alabaster slabs, and sculptured monuments found in these recovered palaces serve in a remarkable manner to confirm the Old Testament history of the kings of Israel. The appearance of the ruins shows that the destruction of the city was due not only to the assailing foe but also to the flood and the fire, thus confirming the ancient prophecies concerning it. “The recent excavations,” says Rawlinson, “have shown that fire was a great instrument in the destruction of the Nineveh palaces. Calcined alabaster, charred wood, and charcoal, colossal statues split through with heat, are met with in parts of the Nineveh mounds, and attest the veracity of prophecy.”

 Nineveh in its glory was ([Jonah 3:4](/jonah#Jonah.3.4)) an “exceeding great city of three days’ journey”, i.e., probably in circuit. This would give a circumference of about 60 miles. At the four corners of an irregular quadrangle are the ruins of Kouyunjik, Nimrud, Karamless and Khorsabad. These four great masses of ruins, with the whole area included within the parallelogram they form by lines drawn from the one to the other, are generally regarded as composing the whole ruins of Nineveh.",http://pleiades.stoa.org/places/874621,36.34773,43.1609,,,VERIFIED,settlement,"Nineveh/Ninos|Nabi Yunus|Nineveh/Ninos, Kuyunjik, Mosul",41dceada-bd4e-4688-8476-c3bfde786e76,,,,asshur_349,36.34773,43.1609,N,nineveh_899

 In ancient times this city was full of obelisks dedicated to the sun. Of these only one now remains standing. “Cleopatra’s Needle” was one of those which stood in this city in front of the Temple of Tum, i.e., “the sun.” It is now erected on the Thames Embankment, London.

This name is not found in the Old Testament, and in the New Testament it is mentioned only in the passages above referred to.

 “In the Egyptian inscriptions Phoenicia is called Keft, the inhabitants being Kefa; and since Keft-ur, or ‘Greater Phoenicia,’ was the name given to the delta of the Nile from the Phoenician colonies settled upon it, the Philistines who came from Caphtor or Keft-ur must have been of Phoenician origin” (comp. [Deut. 2:23](/deut#Deut.2.23); [Jer. 47:4](/jer#Jer.47.4); [Amos 9:7](/amos#Amos.9.7))., Sayce’s Bible and the Monuments.

 Phoenicia lay in the very centre of the old world, and was the natural entrepot for commerce with foreign nations. It was the “England of antiquity.” “The trade routes from all Asia converged on the Phoenician coast; the centres of commerce on the Euphrates and Tigris forwarding their goods by way of Tyre to the Nile, to Arabia, and to the west; and, on the other hand, the productions of the vast regions bordering the Mediterranean passing through the Canaanite capital to the eastern world.” It was “situate at the entry of the sea, a merchant of the people for many isles” ([Ezek. 27:3](/ezek#Ezek.27.3), [4](/ezek#Ezek.27.4)). The far-reaching commercial activity of the Phoenicians, especially with Tarshish and the western world, enriched them with vast wealth, which introduced boundless luxury and developed among them a great activity in all manner of arts and manufactures.

 The Phoenicians were the most enterprising merchants of the old world, establishing colonies at various places, of which Carthage was the chief. They were a Canaanite branch of the race of Ham, and are frequently called Sidonians, from their principal city of Sidon. None could “skill to hew timber like unto the Sidonians” ([1 Kings 5:6](/1kgs#1Kgs.5.6)). King Hiram rendered important service to Solomon in connection with the planning and building of the temple, casting for him all the vessels for the temple service, and the two pillars which stood in the front of the porch, and “the molten sea” ([1 Kings 7:21-23](/1kgs#1Kgs.7.21)). Singular marks have been found by recent exploration on the great stones that form the substructure of the temple. These marks, both painted and engraved, have been regarded as made by the workmen in the quarries, and as probably intended to indicate the place of these stones in the building. “The Biblical account ([1 Kings 5:17](/1kgs#1Kgs.5.17), [18](/1kgs#1Kgs.5.18)) is accurately descriptive of the massive masonry now existing at the south-eastern angle (of the temple area), and standing on the native rock 80 feet below the present surface. The Royal Engineers found, buried deeply among the rubbish of many centuries, great stones, costly and hewed stones, forming the foundation of the sanctuary wall; while Phoenician fragments of pottery and Phoenician marks painted on the massive blocks seem to proclaim that the stones were prepared in the quarry by the cunning workmen of Hiram, the king of Tyre.”

 The Phoenicians have been usually regarded as the inventors of alphabetic writing. The Egyptians expressed their thoughts by certain symbols, called “hieroglyphics”, i.e., sacred carvings, so styled because used almost exclusively on sacred subjects. The recent discovery, however, of inscriptions in Southern Arabia (Yemen and Hadramaut), known as Hemyaritic, in connection with various philogical considerations, has led some to the conclusion that the Phoenician alphabet was derived from the Mineans (admitting the antiquity of the kingdom of Ma’in, [Judg. 10:12](/judg#Judg.10.12); [2 Chr. 26:7](/2chr#2Chr.26.7)). Thus the Phoenician alphabet ceases to be the mother alphabet. Sayce thinks “it is more than possible that the Egyptians themselves were emigrants from Southern Arabia.”

 “The Phoenicians were renowned in ancient times for the manufacture of glass, and some of the specimens of this work that have been preserved are still the wonder of mankind...In the matter of shipping, whether ship-building be thought of or traffic upon the sea, the Phoenicians surpassed all other nations.” “The name Phoenicia is of uncertain origin, though it may be derived from Fenkhu, the name given in the Egyptian inscriptions to the natives of Palestine. Among the chief Phoenician cities were Tyre and Sidon, Gebal north of Beirut, Arvad or Arados and Zemar.”",http://pleiades.stoa.org/places/678334,33.25,35.25,,,VERIFIED,region,Phoenice,617a91c8-06c6-4840-9f2b-695ac9b3a6cb,,Voyage from Miletus to Jerusalem,Third Missionary Journey,"paul_2479, philip_2347, agabus_107, mnason_2102",33.25,35.25,P,phenicia_944

The fact of her covering the spies with bundles of flax which lay on her house-roof (2:6) is an ‘undesigned coincidence’ which strictly corroborates the narrative.

It is connected with the Indian Ocean, of which it is an arm, by the Strait of Bab-el-Mandeb. At a point (Ras Mohammed) about 200 miles from its nothern extremity it is divided into two arms, that on the east called the AElanitic Gulf, now the Bahr el-‘Akabah, about 100 miles long by 15 broad, and that on the west the Gulf of Suez, about 150 miles long by about 20 broad. This branch is now connected with the Mediterranean by the Suez Canal. Between these two arms lies the Sinaitic Peninsula.

 The Hebrew name generally given to this sea is Yam Suph. This word suph means a woolly kind of sea-weed, which the sea casts up in great abundance on its shores. In these passages, [Ex. 10:19](/exod#Exod.10.19); [13:18](/exod#Exod.13.18); [15:4](/exod#Exod.15.4), [22](/exod#Exod.15.22); [23:31](/exod#Exod.23.31); [Num. 14:25](/num#Num.14.25), etc., the Hebrew name is always translated “Red Sea,” which was the name given to it by the Greeks. The origin of this name (Red Sea) is uncertain. Some think it is derived from the red colour of the mountains on the western shore; others from the red coral found in the sea, or the red appearance sometimes given to the water by certain zoophytes floating in it. In the New Testament ([Acts 7:36](/acts#Acts.7.36); [Heb. 11:29](/heb#Heb.11.29)) this name is given to the Gulf of Suez.

 This sea was also called by the Hebrews Yam-mitstraim, i.e., “the Egyptian sea” ([Isa. 11:15](/isa#Isa.11.15)), and simply Ha-yam, “the sea” ([Ex. 14:2](/exod#Exod.14.2), [9](/exod#Exod.14.9), [16](/exod#Exod.14.16), [21](/exod#Exod.14.21), [28](/exod#Exod.14.28); [Josh. 24:6](/josh#Josh.24.6), [7](/josh#Josh.24.7); [Isa. 10:26](/isa#Isa.10.26), etc.).

 The great historical event connected with the Red Sea is the passage of the children of Israel, and the overthrow of the Egyptians, to which there is frequent reference in Scripture ([Ex. 14](/exod#Exod.14), [15](/exod#Exod.15); [Num. 33:8](/num#Num.33.8); [Deut. 11:4](/deut#Deut.11.4); [Josh. 2:10](/josh#Josh.2.10); [Judg. 11:16](/judg#Judg.11.16); [2 Sam. 22:16](/2sam#2Sam.22.16); [Neh. 9:9-11](/neh#Neh.9.9); [Ps. 66:6](/ps#Ps.66.6); [Isa. 10:26](/isa#Isa.10.26); [Acts 7:36](/acts#Acts.7.36), etc.).",http://pleiades.stoa.org/places/39290,19.0,39.5,,,VERIFIED,water-open,Arabicus Sinus/Erythr(ae)um/Rubrum Mare,8934a32d-2c7c-45ba-8bc9-0af4dea7c9ca,,,,,19.0,39.5,R,red_sea_986

At the command of God Moses smote “the rock in Horeb,” and a copious stream flowed forth, enough for all the people. After this the Amalekites attacked the Israelites while they were here encamped, but they were utterly defeated ([Ex. 17:1](/exod#Exod.17.1), [8](/exod#Exod.17.8)-16).

It is said to have been founded B.C. 753. When the New Testament was written, Rome was enriched and adorned with the spoils of the world, and contained a population estimated at 1,200,000, of which the half were slaves, and including representatives of nearly every nation then known. It was distinguished for its wealth and luxury and profligacy. The empire of which it was the capital had then reached its greatest prosperity.

 On the day of Pentecost there were in Jerusalem “strangers from Rome,” who doubtless carried with them back to Rome tidings of that great day, and were instrumental in founding the church there. Paul was brought to this city a prisoner, where he remained for two years ([Acts 28:30](/acts#Acts.28.30), [31](/acts#Acts.28.31)) “in his own hired house.” While here, Paul wrote his epistles to the Philippians, to the Ephesians, to the Colossians, to Philemon, and probably also to the Hebrews. He had during these years for companions Luke and Aristarchus ([Acts 27:2](/acts#Acts.27.2)), Timothy ([Phil. 1:1](/phil#Phil.1.1); [Col. 1:1](/col#Col.1.1)), Tychicus ([Eph. 6](/eph#Eph.6): 21), Epaphroditus ([Phil. 4:18](/phil#Phil.4.18)), and John Mark ([Col. 4:10](/col#Col.4.10)).

 Beneath this city are extensive galleries, called “catacombs,” which were used from about the time of the apostles (one of the inscriptions found in them bears the date A.D. 71) for some three hundred years as places of refuge in the time of persecution, and also of worship and burial. About four thousand inscriptions have been found in the catacombs.

The Arabs call it Bahr Lut, i.e., the Sea of Lot. It lies about 16 miles in a straight line to the east of Jerusalem. Its surface is 1,292 feet below the surface of the Mediterranean Sea. It covers an area of about 300 square miles. Its depth varies from 1,310 to 11 feet. From various phenomena that have been observed, its bottom appears to be still subsiding. It is about 53 miles long, and of an average breadth of 10 miles. It has no outlet, the great heat of that region causing such rapid evaporation that its average depth, notwithstanding the rivers that run into it, is maintained with little variation. The Jordan alone discharges into it no less than six million tons of water every twenty-four hours.

 The waters of the Dead Sea contain 24.6 per cent. of mineral salts, about seven times as much as in ordinary sea-water; thus they are unusually buoyant. Chloride of magnesium is most abundant; next to that chloride of sodium (common salt). But terraces of alluvial deposits in the deep valley of the Jordan show that formerly one great lake extended from the Waters of Merom to the foot of the watershed in the Arabah. The waters were then about 1,400 feet above the present level of the Dead Sea, or slightly above that of the Mediterranean, and at that time were much less salt.

 Nothing living can exist in this sea. “The fish carried down by the Jordan at once die, nor can even mussels or corals live in it; but it is a fable that no bird can fly over it, or that there are no living creatures on its banks. Dr. Tristram found on the shores three kinds of kingfishers, gulls, ducks, and grebes, which he says live on the fish which enter the sea in shoals, and presently die. He collected one hundred and eighteen species of birds, some new to science, on the shores, or swimming or flying over the waters. The cane-brakes which fringe it at some parts are the homes of about forty species of mammalia, several of them animals unknown in England; and innumerable tropical or semi-tropical plants perfume the atmosphere wherever fresh water can reach. The climate is perfect and most delicious, and indeed there is perhaps no place in the world where a sanatorium could be established with so much prospect of benefit as at Ain Jidi (Engedi).”, Geikie’s Hours, etc.",http://pleiades.stoa.org/places/697709,31.577850349494952,35.52394311,,,VERIFIED,lake,Mortuum Mare/Asphaltitis L.,a8f13f59-889b-4d7b-a09c-4ab62768a1ad,,,,,31.577850349494952,35.52394311,S,salt_sea_1021

In the heart of the mountains of Israel, a few miles north-west of Shechem, stands the “hill of Shomeron,” a solitary mountain, a great “mamelon.” It is an oblong hill, with steep but not inaccessible sides, and a long flat top. Omri, the king of Israel, purchased this hill from Shemer its owner for two talents of silver, and built on its broad summit the city to which he gave the name of “Shomeron”, i.e., Samaria, as the new capital of his kingdom instead of Tirzah ([1 Kings 16:24](/1kgs#1Kgs.16.24)). As such it possessed many advantages. Here Omri resided during the last six years of his reign. As the result of an unsuccessful war with Syria, he appears to have been obliged to grant to the Syrians the right to “make streets in Samaria”, i.e., probably permission to the Syrian merchants to carry on their trade in the Israelite capital. This would imply the existence of a considerable Syrian population. “It was the only great city of Palestine created by the sovereign. All the others had been already consecrated by patriarchal tradition or previous possession. But Samaria was the choice of Omri alone. He, indeed, gave to the city which he had built the name of its former owner, but its especial connection with himself as its founder is proved by the designation which it seems Samaria bears in Assyrian inscriptions, Beth-khumri (‘the house or palace of Omri’).”, Stanley.

 Samaria was frequently besieged. In the days of Ahab, Benhadad II. came up against it with thirty-two vassal kings, but was defeated with a great slaughter ([1 Kings 20:1-21](/1kgs#1Kgs.20.1)). A second time, next year, he assailed it; but was again utterly routed, and was compelled to surrender to Ahab (20:28-34), whose army, as compared with that of Benhadad, was no more than “two little flocks of kids.”

 In the days of Jehoram this Benhadad again laid siege to Samaria, during which the city was reduced to the direst extremities. But just when success seemed to be within their reach, they suddenly broke up the seige, alarmed by a mysterious noise of chariots and horses and a great army, and fled, leaving their camp with all its contents behind them. The famishing inhabitants of the city were soon relieved with the abundance of the spoil of the Syrian camp; and it came to pass, according to the word of Elisha, that “a measure of fine flour was sold for a shekel, and two measures of barely for a shekel, in the gates of Samaria” ([2 Kings 7:1-20](/2kgs#2Kgs.7.1)).

 Shalmaneser invaded Israel in the days of Hoshea, and reduced it to vassalage. He laid siege to Samaria (B.C. 723), which held out for three years, and was at length captured by Sargon, who completed the conquest Shalmaneser had begun ([2 Kings 18:9-12](/2kgs#2Kgs.18.9); [17:3](/2kgs#2Kgs.17.3)), and removed vast numbers of the tribes into captivity.

 This city, after passing through various vicissitudes, was given by the emperor Augustus to Herod the Great, who rebuilt it, and called it Sebaste (Gr. form of Augustus) in honour of the emperor. In the New Testament the only mention of it is in [Acts 8:5-14](/acts#Acts.8.5), where it is recorded that Philip went down to the city of Samaria and preached there.

In this distance of 26 1/2 miles there is a fall in the river of 1,682 feet, or of more than 60 feet to the mile. It is 27 miles east of the Mediterranean, and about 60 miles north-east of Jerusalem. It is of an oval shape, and abounds in fish.

 Its present appearance is thus described: “The utter loneliness and absolute stillness of the scene are exceedingly impressive. It seems as if all nature had gone to rest, languishing under the scorching heat. How different it was in the days of our Lord! Then all was life and bustle along the shores; the cities and villages that thickly studded them resounded with the hum of a busy population; while from hill-side and corn-field came the cheerful cry of shepherd and ploughman. The lake, too, was dotted with dark fishing-boats and spangled with white sails. Now a mournful, solitary silence reigns over sea and shore. The cities are in ruins!”

 This sea is chiefly of interest as associated with the public ministry of our Lord. Capernaum, “his own city” ([Matt. 9:1](/matt#Matt.9.1)), stood on its shores. From among the fishermen who plied their calling on its waters he chose Peter and his brother Andrew, and James and John, to be disciples, and sent them forth to be “fishers of men” ([Matt. 4:18](/matt#Matt.4.18), [22](/matt#Matt.4.22); [Mark 1:16-20](/mark#Mark.1.16); [Luke 5](/luke#Luke.5): 1-11). He stilled its tempest, saying to the storm that swept over it, “Peace, be still” ([Matt. 8:23-27](/matt#Matt.8.23); [Mark 7:31-35](/mark#Mark.7.31)); and here also he showed himself after his resurrection to his disciples ([John 21](/john#John.21)).

 “The Sea of Galilee is indeed the cradle of the gospel. The subterranean fires of nature prepared a lake basin, through which a river afterwards ran, keeping its waters always fresh. In this basin a vast quantity of shell-fish swarmed, and multiplied to such an extent that they formed the food of an extraordinary profusion of fish. The great variety and abundance of the fish in the lake attracted to its shores a larger and more varied population than existed elsewhere in Palestine, whereby this secluded district was brought into contact with all parts of the world. And this large and varied population, with access to all nations and countries, attracted the Lord Jesus, and induced him to make this spot the centre of his public ministry.”",http://pleiades.stoa.org/places/678430,32.8138046,35.590564,,,VERIFIED,"lake,water-inland",Tiberiadis Mare/Gennesar Lacus,e73b049c-bc0d-447a-8fe4-72f9870ef058,,,,,32.8138046,35.590564,S,sea_of_galilee_1032

It stood in the narrow sheltered valley between Ebal on the north and Gerizim on the south, these mountains at their base being only some 500 yards apart. Here Abraham pitched his tent and built his first altar in the Promised Land, and received the first divine promise ([Gen. 12:6](/gen#Gen.12.6), [7](/gen#Gen.12.7)). Here also Jacob “bought a parcel of a field at the hands of the children of Hamor” after his return from Mesopotamia, and settled with his household, which he purged from idolatry by burying the teraphim of his followers under an oak tree, which was afterwards called “the oak of the sorcerer” ([Gen. 33:19](/gen#Gen.33.19); [35:4](/gen#Gen.35.4); [Judg. 9:37](/judg#Judg.9.37)). Here too, after a while, he dug a well, which bears his name to this day ([John 4:5](/john#John.4.5), [39-42](/john#John.4.39)). To Shechem Joshua gathered all Israel “before God,” and delivered to them his second parting address ([Josh. 24:1-15](/josh#Josh.24.1)). He “made a covenant with the people that day” at the very place where, on first entering the land, they had responded to the law from Ebal and Gerizim ([Josh. 24:25](/josh#Josh.24.25)), the terms of which were recorded “in the book of the law of God”, i.e., in the roll of the law of Moses; and in memory of this solemn transaction a great stone was set up “under an oak” (comp. [Gen. 28:18](/gen#Gen.28.18); [31:44-48](/gen#Gen.31.44); [Ex. 24:4](/exod#Exod.24.4); [Josh. 4:3](/josh#Josh.4.3), [8](/josh#Josh.4.8), [9](/josh#Josh.4.9)), possibly the old “oak of Moreh,” as a silent witness of the transaction to all coming time.

 Shechem became one of the cities of refuge, the central city of refuge for Western Palestine ([Josh. 20:7](/josh#Josh.20.7)), and here the bones of Joseph were buried (24:32). Rehoboam was appointed king in Shechem ([1 Kings 12:1](/1kgs#1Kgs.12.1), [19](/1kgs#1Kgs.12.19)), but Jeroboam afterwards took up his residence here. This city is mentioned in connection with our Lord’s conversation with the woman of Samaria ([John 4:5](/john#John.4.5)); and thus, remaining as it does to the present day, it is one of the oldest cities of the world. It is the modern Nablus, a contraction for Neapolis, the name given to it by Vespasian. It lies about a mile and a half up the valley on its southern slope, and on the north of Gerizim, which rises about 1,100 feet above it, and is about 34 miles north of Jerusalem. It contains about 10,000 inhabitants, of whom about 160 are Samaritans and 100 Jews, the rest being Christians and Mohammedans.

 The site of Shechem is said to be of unrivalled beauty. Stanley says it is “the most beautiful, perhaps the only very beautiful, spot in Central Palestine.”

 Gaza, near Shechem, only mentioned [1 Chr. 7:28](/1chr#1Chr.7.28), has entirely disappeared.

It received its name from the “first-born” of Canaan, the grandson of Noah ([Gen. 10:15](/gen#Gen.10.15), [19](/gen#Gen.10.19)). It was the first home of the Phoenicians on the coast of Palestine, and from its extensive commercial relations became a “great” city ([Josh. 11:8](/josh#Josh.11.8); [19:28](/josh#Josh.19.28)). It was the mother city of Tyre. It lay within the lot of the tribe of Asher, but was never subdued ([Judg. 1:31](/judg#Judg.1.31)). The Zidonians long oppressed Israel ([Judg. 10:12](/judg#Judg.10.12)). From the time of David its glory began to wane, and Tyre, its “virgin daughter” ([Isa. 23:12](/isa#Isa.23.12)), rose to its place of pre-eminence. Solomon entered into a matrimonial alliance with the Zidonians, and thus their form of idolatrous worship found a place in the land of Israel ([1 Kings 11:1](/1kgs#1Kgs.11.1), [33](/1kgs#1Kgs.11.33)). This city was famous for its manufactures and arts, as well as for its commerce ([1 Kings 5:6](/1kgs#1Kgs.5.6); [1 Chr. 22:4](/1chr#1Chr.22.4); [Ezek. 27:8](/ezek#Ezek.27.8)). It is frequently referred to by the prophets ([Isa. 23:2](/isa#Isa.23.2), [4](/isa#Isa.23.4), [12](/isa#Isa.23.12); [Jer. 25:22](/jer#Jer.25.22); [27:3](/jer#Jer.27.3); [47:4](/jer#Jer.47.4); [Ezek. 27:8](/ezek#Ezek.27.8); [28:21](/ezek#Ezek.28.21), [22](/ezek#Ezek.28.22); [32:30](/ezek#Ezek.32.30); [Joel 3:4](/joel#Joel.3.4)). Our Lord visited the “coasts” of Tyre and Zidon = Sidon (q.v.), [Matt. 15:21](/matt#Matt.15.21); [Mark 7:24](/mark#Mark.7.24); [Luke 4:26](/luke#Luke.4.26); and from this region many came forth to hear him preaching ([Mark 3:8](/mark#Mark.3.8); [Luke 6:17](/luke#Luke.6.17)). From Sidon, at which the ship put in after leaving Caesarea, Paul finally sailed for Rome ([Acts 27:3](/acts#Acts.27.3), [4](/acts#Acts.27.4)).

 This city is now a town of 10,000 inhabitants, with remains of walls built in the twelfth century A.D. In 1855, the sarcophagus of Eshmanezer was discovered. From a Phoenician inscription on its lid, it appears that he was a “king of the Sidonians,” probably in the third century B.C., and that his mother was a priestess of Ashtoreth, “the goddess of the Sidonians.” In this inscription Baal is mentioned as the chief god of the Sidonians.",http://dare.ht.lu.se/places/21115,33.560243,35.371208,,,VERIFIED,settlement,"Sidon/Col.

Here a notable miracle was wrought by our Lord in giving sight to the blind ([John 9:7-11](/john#John.9.7)). It has been identified with the Birket Silwan in the lower Tyropoeon valley, to the south-east of the hill of Zion.

 The water which flows into this pool intermittingly by a subterranean channel springs from the “Fountain of the Virgin” (q.v.). The length of this channel, which has several windings, is 1,750 feet, though the direct distance is only 1,100 feet. The pool is 53 feet in length from north to south, 18 feet wide, and 19 deep. The water passes from it by a channel cut in the rock into the gardens below.

 Many years ago (1880) a youth, while wading up the conduit by which the water enters the pool, accidentally discovered an inscription cut in the rock, on the eastern side, about 19 feet from the pool. This is the oldest extant Hebrew record of the kind. It has with great care been deciphered by scholars, and has been found to be an account of the manner in which the tunnel was constructed. Its whole length is said to be “twelve hundred cubits;” and the inscription further notes that the workmen, like the excavators of the Mont Cenis Tunnel, excavated from both ends, meeting in the middle.

 Some have argued that the inscription was cut in the time of Solomon; others, with more probability, refer it to the reign of Hezekiah. A more ancient tunnel was discovered in 1889 some 20 feet below the ground. It is of smaller dimensions, but more direct in its course. It is to this tunnel that Isaiah (8:6) probably refers.

 The Siloam inscription above referred to was surreptitiously cut from the wall of the tunnel in 1891 and broken into fragments. These were, however, recovered by the efforts of the British Consul at Jerusalem, and have been restored to their original place.",http://sws.geonames.org/4131116,36.18814,-94.5405,,,UNVERIFIED,,Siloam Springs,71f07a2b-50c9-46c5-995e-f778f8f2eb4a,,,,,31.777444,35.234935,S,siloam_1096

Here they remained encamped for about a whole year. Their journey from the Red Sea to this encampment, including all the windings of the route, was about 150 miles. The last twenty-two chapters of Exodus, together with the whole of Leviticus and Num. ch. 1-11, contain a record of all the transactions which occurred while they were here. From Rephidim ([Ex. 17:8-13](/exod#Exod.17.8)) the Israelites journeyed forward through the Wady Solaf and Wady esh-Sheikh into the plain of er-Rahah, “the desert of Sinai,” about 2 miles long and half a mile broad, and encamped there “before the mountain.” The part of the mountain range, a protruding lower bluff, known as the Ras Sasafeh (Sufsafeh), rises almost perpendicularly from this plain, and is in all probability the Sinai of history. Dean Stanley thus describes the scene:, “The plain itself is not broken and uneven and narrowly shut in, like almost all others in the range, but presents a long retiring sweep, within which the people could remove and stand afar off. The cliff, rising like a huge altar in front of the whole congregation, and visible against the sky in lonely grandeur from end to end of the whole plain, is the very image of the ‘mount that might be touched,’ and from which the voice of God might be heard far and wide over the plain below.” This was the scene of the giving of the law. From the Ras Sufsafeh the law was proclaimed to the people encamped below in the plain of er-Rahah. During the lengthened period of their encampment here the Israelites passed through a very memorable experience. An immense change passed over them. They are now an organized nation, bound by covenant engagement to serve the Lord their God, their ever-present divine Leader and Protector. At length, in the second month of the second year of the Exodus, they move their camp and march forward according to a prescribed order. After three days they reach the “wilderness of Paran,” the “et-Tih”, i.e., “the desert”, and here they make their first encampment. At this time a spirit of discontent broke out amongst them, and the Lord manifested his displeasure by a fire which fell on the encampment and inflicted injury on them. Moses called the place Taberah (q.v.), [Num. 11:1-3](/num#Num.11.1). The journey between Sinai and the southern boundary of the Promised Land (about 150 miles) at Kadesh was accomplished in about a year.",http://pleiades.stoa.org/places/746813,29.5,34,,,VERIFIED,"peninsula,region",Sinai,0c94e8fc-daef-4374-b233-30d8a2c4ec34,,,,,29.5,34,S,sinai_1098

 “From the historic annals now accessible to us, the history of Syria may be divided into three periods: The first, the period when the power of the Pharaohs was dominant over the fertile fields or plains of Syria and the merchant cities of Tyre and Sidon, and when such mighty conquerors as Thothmes III. and Rameses II. could claim dominion and levy tribute from the nations from the banks of the Euphrates to the borders of the Libyan desert. Second, this was followed by a short period of independence, when the Jewish nation in the south was growing in power, until it reached its early zenith in the golden days of Solomon; and when Tyre and Sidon were rich cities, sending their traders far and wide, over land and sea, as missionaries of civilization, while in the north the confederate tribes of the Hittites held back the armies of the kings of Assyria. The third, and to us most interesting, period is that during which the kings of Assyria were dominant over the plains of Syria; when Tyre, Sidon, Ashdod, and Jerusalem bowed beneath the conquering armies of Shalmaneser, Sargon, and Sennacherib; and when at last Memphis and Thebes yielded to the power of the rulers of Nineveh and Babylon, and the kings of Assyria completed with terrible fulness the bruising of the reed of Egypt so clearly foretold by the Hebrew prophets.”, Boscawen.",http://pleiades.stoa.org/places/1306,37.5,37.5,,,VERIFIED,unknown,Syria,af11fba2-f61e-4eab-8244-81629d2447f0,,"Second Missionary Journey begins,Return from Second Missionary Journey,Voyage from Miletus to Jerusalem","Second Missionary Journey, Second Missionary Journey, Third Missionary Journey","paul_2479, silas_2740, philip_2347, aquila_279, priscilla_2370, agabus_107, mnason_2102",37.5,37.5,S,syria_1122

The question as to the locality of Tarshish has given rise to not a little discussion. Some think there was a Tarshish in the East, on the Indian coast, seeing that “ships of Tarshish” sailed from Eziongeber, on the Red Sea ([1 Kings 9:26](/1kgs#1Kgs.9.26); [22:48](/1kgs#1Kgs.22.48); [2 Chr. 9:21](/2chr#2Chr.9.21)). Some, again, argue that Carthage was the place so named. There can be little doubt, however, that this is the name of a Phoenician port in Spain, between the two mouths of the Guadalquivir (the name given to the river by the Arabs, and meaning “the great wady” or water-course). It was founded by a Carthaginian colony, and was the farthest western harbour of Tyrian sailors. It was to this port Jonah’s ship was about to sail from Joppa. It has well been styled “the Peru of Tyrian adventure;” it abounded in gold and silver mines.

 It appears that this name also is used without reference to any locality. “Ships of Tarshish” is an expression sometimes denoting simply ships intended for a long voyage ([Isa. 23:1](/isa#Isa.23.1), [14](/isa#Isa.23.14)), ships of a large size (sea-going ships), whatever might be the port to which they sailed.

It was the capital of one of the four Roman districts of Macedonia, and was ruled by a praetor. It was named after Thessalonica, the wife of Cassander, who built the city. She was so called by her father, Philip, because he first heard of her birth on the day of his gaining a victory over the Thessalians. On his second missionary journey, Paul preached in the synagogue here, the chief synagogue of the Jews in that part of Macedonia, and laid the foundations of a church ([Acts 17:1-4](/acts#Acts.17.1); [1 Thes. 1:9](/1thess#1Thess.1.9)). The violence of the Jews drove him from the city, when he fled to Berea ([Acts 17:5-10](/acts#Acts.17.5)).

It is said to have been founded by Herod Antipas (A.D. 16), on the site of the ruins of an older city called Rakkath, and to have been thus named by him after the Emperor Tiberius. It is mentioned only three times in the history of our Lord ([John 6:1](/john#John.6.1), [23](/john#John.6.23); 21:1).

 In 1837 about one-half of the inhabitants perished by an earthquake. The population of the city is now about six thousand, nearly the one-half being Jews. “We do not read that our Lord ever entered this city. The reason of this is probably to be found in the fact that it was practically a heathen city, though standing upon Jewish soil. Herod, its founder, had brought together the arts of Greece, the idolatry of Rome, and the gross lewdness of Asia. There were in it a theatre for the performance of comedies, a forum, a stadium, a palace roofed with gold in imitation of those in Italy, statues of the Roman gods, and busts of the deified emperors. He who was not sent but to the lost sheep of the house of Israel might well hold himself aloof from such scenes as these” (Manning’s Those Holy Fields).

 After the fall of Jerusalem (A.D. 70), Tiberias became one of the chief residences of the Jews in Palestine. It was for more than three hundred years their metropolis. From about A.D. 150 the Sanhedrin settled here, and established rabbinical schools, which rose to great celebrity. Here the Jerusalem (or Palestinian) Talmud was compiled about the beginning of the fifth century. To this same rabbinical school also we are indebted for the Masora, a “body of traditions which transmitted the readings of the Hebrew text of the Old Testament, and preserved, by means of the vowel-system, the pronunciation of the Hebrew.” In its original form, and in all manuscripts, the Hebrew is written without vowels; hence, when it ceased to be a spoken language, the importance of knowing what vowels to insert between the consonants. This is supplied by the Masora, and hence these vowels are called the “Masoretic vowel-points.”",http://sws.geonames.org/293322,32.79221,35.53124,,,UNVERIFIED,,Tiberias,269dddba-da4c-4629-bc0d-a6287d439015,,,,,32.79553799,35.5292204,T,tiberias_1161

Sidon was the oldest Phoenician city, but Tyre had a longer and more illustrious history. The commerce of the whole world was gathered into the warehouses of Tyre. “Tyrian merchants were the first who ventured to navigate the Mediterranean waters; and they founded their colonies on the coasts and neighbouring islands of the AEgean Sea, in Greece, on the northern coast of Africa, at Carthage and other places, in Sicily and Corsica, in Spain at Tartessus, and even beyond the pillars of Hercules at Gadeira (Cadiz)” (Driver’s Isaiah). In the time of David a friendly alliance was entered into between the Hebrews and the Tyrians, who were long ruled over by their native kings ([2 Sam. 5:11](/2sam#2Sam.5.11); [1 Kings 5:1](/1kgs#1Kgs.5.1); [2 Chr. 2:3](/2chr#2Chr.2.3)).

 Tyre consisted of two distinct parts, a rocky fortress on the mainland, called “Old Tyre,” and the city, built on a small, rocky island about half-a-mile distant from the shore. It was a place of great strength. It was besieged by Shalmaneser, who was assisted by the Phoenicians of the mainland, for five years, and by Nebuchadnezzar (B.C. 586-573) for thirteen years, apparently without success. It afterwards fell under the power of Alexander the Great, after a siege of seven months, but continued to maintain much of its commercial importance till the Christian era. It is referred to in [Matt. 11:21](/matt#Matt.11.21) and [Acts 12:20](/acts#Acts.12.20). In A.D. 1291 it was taken by the Saracens, and has remained a desolate ruin ever since.

 “The purple dye of Tyre had a worldwide celebrity on account of the durability of its beautiful tints, and its manufacture proved a source of abundant wealth to the inhabitants of that city.”

 Both Tyre and Sidon “were crowded with glass-shops, dyeing and weaving establishments; and among their cunning workmen not the least important class were those who were celebrated for the engraving of precious stones.” ([2 Chr. 2:7](/2chr#2Chr.2.7), [14](/2chr#2Chr.2.14)).

 The wickedness and idolatry of this city are frequently denounced by the prophets, and its final destruction predicted ([Isa. 23:1](/isa#Isa.23.1); [Jer. 25:22](/jer#Jer.25.22); [Ezek. 26](/ezek#Ezek.26); [28:1-19](/ezek#Ezek.28.1); [Amos 1:9](/amos#Amos.1.9), [10](/amos#Amos.1.10); [Zech. 9:2-4](/zech#Zech.9.2)).

 Here a church was founded soon after the death of Stephen, and Paul, on his return from his third missionary journey spent a week in intercourse with the disciples there ([Acts 21:4](/acts#Acts.21.4)). Here the scene at Miletus was repeated on his leaving them. They all, with their wives and children, accompanied him to the sea-shore. The sea-voyage of the apostle terminated at Ptolemais, about 38 miles from Tyre. Thence he proceeded to Caesarea ([Acts 21:5-8](/acts#Acts.21.5)).

 “It is noticed on monuments as early as B.C. 1500, and claiming, according to Herodotus, to have been founded about B.C. 2700. It had two ports still existing, and was of commercial importance in all ages, with colonies at Carthage (about B.C. 850) and all over the Mediterranean. It was often attacked by Egypt and Assyria, and taken by Alexander the Great after a terrible siege in B.C. 332. It is now a town of 3,000 inhabitants, with ancient tombs and a ruined cathedral. A short Phoenician text of the fourth century B.C. is the only monument yet recovered.”",http://dare.ht.lu.se/places/21116,33.268071,35.209358,,,VERIFIED,"circus,settlement","Tyrus/Col.

It stood near the mouth of the Euphrates, on its western bank, and is represented by the mounds (of bricks cemented by bitumen) of el-Mugheir, i.e., “the bitumined,” or “the town of bitumen,” now 150 miles from the sea and some 6 miles from the Euphrates, a little above the point where it receives the Shat el-Hie, an affluent from the Tigris. It was formerly a maritime city, as the waters of the Persian Gulf reached thus far inland. Ur was the port of Babylonia, whence trade was carried on with the dwellers on the gulf, and with the distant countries of India, Ethiopia, and Egypt. It was abandoned about B.C. 500, but long continued, like Erech, to be a great sacred cemetery city, as is evident from the number of tombs found there.

 The oldest king of Ur known to us is Ur-Ba’u (servant of the goddess Ba’u), as Hommel reads the name, or Ur-Gur, as others read it. He lived some twenty-eight hundred years B.C., and took part in building the famous temple of the moon-god Sin in Ur itself. The illustration here given represents his cuneiform inscription, written in the Sumerian language, and stamped upon every brick of the temple in Ur. It reads: “Ur-Ba’u, king of Ur, who built the temple of the moon-god.”

 “Ur was consecrated to the worship of Sin, the Babylonian moon-god. It shared this honour, however, with another city, and this city was Haran, or Harran. Harran was in Mesopotamia, and took its name from the highroad which led through it from the east to the west. The name is Babylonian, and bears witness to its having been founded by a Babylonian king. The same witness is still more decisively borne by the worship paid in it to the Babylonian moon-god and by its ancient temple of Sin. Indeed, the temple of the moon-god at Harran was perhaps even more famous in the Assyrian and Babylonian world than the temple of the moon-god at Ur.

 “Between Ur and Harran there must, consequently, have been a close connection in early times, the record of which has not yet been recovered. It may be that Harran owed its foundation to a king of Ur; at any rate the two cities were bound together by the worship of the same deity, the closest and most enduring bond of union that existed in the ancient world. That Terah should have migrated from Ur to Harran, therefore, ceases to be extraordinary. If he left Ur at all, it was the most natural place to which to go. It was like passing from one court of a temple into another.

 “Such a remarkable coincidence between the Biblical narrative and the evidence of archaeological research cannot be the result of chance. The narrative must be historical; no writer of late date, even if he were a Babylonian, could have invented a story so exactly in accordance with what we now know to have been the truth. For a story of the kind to have been the invention of Palestinian tradition is equally impossible. To the unprejudiced mind there is no escape from the conclusion that the history of the migration of Terah from Ur to Harran is founded on fact” (Sayce).",http://dare.ht.lu.se/places/22335,30.9625,46.103056,"haran_1407,abraham_58,nahor_2143",haran_1407,VERIFIED,"settlement,urban,temple-2","Ur(i)|Uri/Ur, Tell Muqayyar",9cc72ca8-87d7-43b7-b0c8-c3e97992a96f,,,,"terah_2841, abraham_58, lot_1830, haran_1407, sarah_2473, canaan_914",30.9625,46.103056,U,ur_1189

It had been the place where the idolatrous Jews burned their children alive to Moloch and Baal. A particular part of the valley was called Tophet, or the “fire-stove,” where the children were burned. After the Exile, in order to show their abhorrence of the locality, the Jews made this valley the receptacle of the offal of the city, for the destruction of which a fire was, as is supposed, kept constantly burning there.

 The Jews associated with this valley these two ideas, (1) that of the sufferings of the victims that had there been sacrificed; and (2) that of filth and corruption. It became thus to the popular mind a symbol of the abode of the wicked hereafter. It came to signify hell as the place of the wicked. “It might be shown by infinite examples that the Jews expressed hell, or the place of the damned, by this word. The word Gehenna [the Greek contraction of Hinnom] was never used in the time of Christ in any other sense than to denote the place of future punishment.” About this fact there can be no question. In this sense the word is used eleven times in our Lord’s discourses ([Matt. 23:33](/matt#Matt.23.33); [Luke 12:5](/luke#Luke.12.5); [Matt. 5:22](/matt#Matt.5.22), etc.).",,,,,,UNVERIFIED,,,b74eb7de-550a-4629-a917-86e990f25848,,,,,31.769079,35.227994,V,valley_of_hinnom_1207
